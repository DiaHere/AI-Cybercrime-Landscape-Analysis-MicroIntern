My idea for a new BN game was always Lan and Mega slightly older - high school or university, and edgier. Maybe scilab has a faction that goss out of control and builds a spyware virus that goes into people&#039;s homepages and corrupts their navis. And you fight corrupted versions of lots of popular navis. Yai gets hotter and you get a Glyde encounter. I would love for a new game to have multiple branching asynchronous quests, as well as toggleable encounters and proper zones like pokemon grass instead of nonstop encounters. No viruses in &quot;main&quot; areas but as soon as you step off the beaten path you have a chance for encounters."

An MMO would have a &quot;something is happening somewhere but not to everyone&quot; sense about it so you would be able to go on quests and such but it would just seem like &quot;another day on the net&quot; rather than a crisis that is on you to fix.It&#039;s the same issue I think .hack would have if they tried to make The World its own standalone MMO."

I wanna say your very first style is completely random(element and the style) but afterwards it the normal what everyone else said. The next time you get a style change you&#039;ll have the option to either change to the new one or keep the old one. Ideally you&#039;d want to keep the old so you can level it up to V3 and get all the perks(actually I can&#039;t remember if BN2 actually gave you an item or something to keep when you level them up). I also can&#039;t remember if it was BN2 or 3 that let you have up to 2 styles saved that you can switch to."
