This suggests that when Agetec beefed it, FROM inherited the rights to all those games meaning the PS2 generation is free game for re-release. Yes, the PS3 titles are going to be a crapshoot if they ever try what with Sega and Ubisoft being involved on top of Bamco but my concern is the PS2 titles currently."

However, it was quickly changed in an early patch alongside it&#039;s little brother the SHAITAN, the HOLOFERNES parts, and the entire SALAF frame. These all got switched quickly, likely a push by Sega to avoid pissing people off with cultural or religious naming (I mean the SHAITAN sounded hilariously close to SATAN for fucks sake). The original names stuck for a lot of online resources as a result."

        "text": "Anyone else really hate having to unlock or find parts in AC games? Been playing these for over 20 years now and I&#039;ve never been a fan of that aspect of the games. In other games unlockables are typically &quot;unlockable&quot; because they are better than the regular stuff meriting earning them. However in AC games this falls flat on it&#039;s ass because outside of special cases like the MOONLIGHT or KARASAWA unlockable parts typically aren&#039;t any better than the regular ones. All this does is prevent you from building a specific AC you want to try until a later point in the game or the very fucking end of it or worse, several god damn playthroughs in (yeah fuck AC6 for that one).Hot take, everything should be in the shop at the very start of every AC game and instead of forcing you to play through the game to unlock more stuff parts should cost more to keep up with credit flow from missions (arena matches shouldn&#039;t award credits either). This would give you something visible and tangible to work towards rather than not even knowing something exists unless you stumble on it or look up a fucking guide and would enhance the &quot;paycheck to paycheck&quot; mercenary roleplay. Which on that note it&#039;s really jarring that I&#039;m supposed to be a Raven but the shop all Ravens are supposed to be using doesn&#039;t even sell all the parts by default which is even stupider when you consider there&#039;s always ACs running around with parts that aren&#039;t in the shop by default. Did these fuckers blow up a convoy they were supposed to be guarding to steal the same part too? Or do a mission in the exact same dam and find the same hidden part inexplicably sitting in a random location? I dunno it&#039;s just silly. If they want unlockables you can use, stuff like tuning currency like gen 4 had with FRS memory would work a lot better."

As a kid playing this series I always wanted to be able to do the types of cool shit that happened in the CGI openings and in mecha anime and shit and no AC game ever let me get anywhere near that until AC6. Closest was ACFA, but ACFA was just so blistering fast you felt like it was dynamic. It wasn&#039;t actually letting you do any dynamic things such as combos or cool finishers, you were just abusing the shit out of speed and the adrenaline rush from that scratched the itch a bit. Here&#039;s hoping that whenever AC7 comes around they take this a step further."

Gen 2 is always just a &quot;get through it stop&quot; for me for the most part when replaying old gens. Don&#039;t get me wrong, AC2 has one of the coolest settings and lore in the series but the balance is ATROCIOUS, most missions are kinda lackluster, and AC2AA? Worst game in the entire series imo. I sometimes skip AC2AA altogether which is something I usually save for &quot;fake&quot; AC games like Formula Front and Ninebreaker, it&#039;s abhorrently bad.

Maybe some more defensive, assault, long range/short range, whatever, but no dedicated shield mechs and healer mechs. The first beta for the game was better because shields and healing were weak enough that it wasn&#039;t a major gameplay element. It more felt like everyone was there to fight.
