I can&#039;t even tell what&#039;s going on in the middle left part, the staff and ribbon blend together too much. There is no negative space to direct my gaze, and even the key on her neck blends with her back so there are no highlights. Even the end of the staff blends with the end of her cape on the lower right.I would have to see the 3D model and animations, but I would rate that illustration as &quot;generic witch slop&quot; on a gacha scale.I like simple but impactful designs better, with good composition, like pic related. Despite using generic japanese clothing, there is literally no other game that has a design like this, so it&#039;s instantly recognizable."

You are thinking about Tethys, which Rover didn&#039;t create, but he did took it and created Shorekeeper from it, which fell in love with him naturally.The sentinel were created by Rover too as one of the many (failed) plans to stop the Lament. There is only one Rover in Solaris 3, however many aliens of his race exist in the universe.Alongside that, he created the black shores, the fractsidus, was the teacher of the teacher of Changli, and probably founded several nation states, like the new federation."

They’d return to playing once the quality matches that of competitors.But miHoYo’s actual strategy is cost-cutting and multi-project development. Their focus right now is definitely not on Honkai: Star Rail or Genshin Impact, but on projects in development like Genshin UGC, Petit Planet, Mi-Pokémon, Mi-Auto Chess, realistic FPS, and realistic open-world games.These past few months, the Mi-community’s sentiment has been players constantly expecting improvements to the games, only to find the direction is completely opposite, rushing toward cost-cutting and efficiency.To some extent, miHoYo is indeed trying to build a Mi-ecosystem, infinitely spreading out the user base across each of their games, not putting all their eggs in one basket.

I see a lot of the Husbando lovers complaining that they play a game that only releases 2 males per month but they doesn&#039;t have a game only for them or the reverse of people only wanting waifus (tho these have a bigger market if they just moved on to another games). Like I think there&#039;s only one Bara gacha in the obscure world of DMM/Erolabs that no one actually goes because it&#039;s just &quot;lower quality&quot; and they just orbit something like a Hoyo game because there&#039;s only one dude that looks like a bear or something.Also doesn&#039;t help that every gacha now wants to do 100k/month instead of growing a community around it first, reasons I think there&#039;s still people around some of the older franchises."

Chinese couples are now forced to adapt the DINK (double income no kids) lifestyle just to survive.&gt;In the old days our grandparents got married and had kids no problem. God took care of the rest!Consider the fact that China&#039;s one child policy means an entire family (4 grandparents, 2 parents, 1 child) is now being supported by the child. That means a married couple bears the economic responsibility for 14 adults. Imagine having multiple kids in that economy."

There have been games with lesbian stuff lately, there&#039;s some VN that added a lesbian marriage. But as straight men are rebelling in China they started complaining about yuri stuff a lot now, for example Wu Chang had to change their lesbian boss because of many complaints and Where Winds Meet, which added some lesbian trash in the main story, also had many complaints and people saying they were going to report the game. So I think eventually the government will start cracking down on yuri stuff as well and start arresting people, so these companies trying to use lesbians to push LGBT ideology into ignorant men are playing with fire."

        "text": "Regarding whether Azur Lane is ML or not, I think that just highlights the current issue with the ML movementThis movement is essentially just a rebellion by waifu players who got tired of being mistreated by mixed toilets. It&#039;s very new, and as a result there will be a lot of disagreements. The main problem is that straight male players still have different tastes and different standards of what they find acceptable. Should ML games have faceless MCs or not? Should male MC be playable? Small female cast or a big one? How much pandering should the main story have? Should there be competitive PvP? Are male NPCs acceptable? How much yuribait is fine, if any? Most people can agree there shouldn&#039;t be NTR, but what exactly is considered cuckshit can sometimes vary from person to person. Do we cater to the extremely sensitive men who can&#039;t even see two girls in their harem interacting without thinking it&#039;s cuckshit? Since ML is a new thing limited to gachas, it can be very difficult to find a consensus.If you ask me, it&#039;s better to just &quot;seek common ground and set aside differences&quot;. Identify some elements that a game should have to be ML that most people can agree with, such as there being a male MC only with no other playable males, all playable girls being for you and there being a significant amount of romance with them. If your game can clear this bar, then we can at least consider it ML. Under these standards, AL would indeed be ML, but of course it&#039;s a very old game that has had lots of drama, and so whether it&#039;s an acceptable game to play or not will depend on the person. Ideally we should have enough different &quot;ML&quot; games that players can simply choose the best one that is compatible with their tastes. I think seeing ML like this is better than how the chinese see it, where if you don&#039;t like Snowbreak or Velvet Code then there&#039;s nothing you can play that is considered ML. But anyway, ML is a chinese movement, at the end of the day we don&#039;t matter that much."

So many gacha writers suck ass though so it&#039;s safer to have them be faceless. That said I do hate when they do stupid shit like Genshin where they give you only two dialog options and they&#039;re just the same sentence split up. If you&#039;re going to let the player express their own personality through dialog then let them.&gt;Should male MC be playable?I&#039;ve never met a ML player who says otherwise unless they&#039;re FemML lovers. FGO is hilarious for that one though, LB7 made some of them SO mad.&gt;How much pandering should the main story have?Lots, but more subtle stuff. Harder hitting should be in side/character stories and stuff like that. Saves time and gives more focus on your favorite girls.&gt;Should there be competitive PvP?Terrible unless there&#039;s no important rewards for it.&gt;Are male NPCs acceptable?Yeah.&gt;How much yuribait is fine, if any?Same for Yaoibait for me, a little is fine. I draw the line at the &quot;delusion&quot; line where you get BL bitches saying that obvious war buddies are CLEARLY gay for each other while everyone else just looks on and calls them retarded. If two girls are friendly with one another and others decide it&#039;s &quot;clearly yuri&quot; where a normal person would just see friendship then whatever. Make it too gay and it&#039;s grosses me the fuck out.&gt;but what exactly is considered cuckshit Males should be more bro-y than anything. If they come off as too flirty with a girl it&#039;s an issue. I&#039;m just fine with male characters since I&#039;m more of a classic ML guy since I&#039;m not super sensitive and whiny. I think it depends mostly on the writers and fans. Mihoyo has too damn many faggot writers who clearly ship characters in all kinds of ways which is bad. No shipping. Zero. Horrible. If you get too many in your fanbase that goes to shit too. You have to cull them constantly or they chase off normal people."

And btw, i agree, genshin success is due to the millions of peanut paying players that are attached to the game, and if other gachas want that they should offer way more for peanuts too. Whales are poor and retarded and less than 1% of the players, you need to target normal people who are willing to spend a little bit on random microtransactions here and there, not be told to do chores for months to maybe get 1/3 of the cast or pay 200 at minimum for a single character with 3 skills."

They are making the same mistake with the next homo they are releasing, it&#039;s a support for Augusta, instead of being a standalone main DPS.

Having really popular characters be just supports or subDPS that can ONLY be used on a team with a homo is not good at all. And the worst part is that Galbrena is going to both replace Changli AND need Brant too, meaning if you didn&#039;t rolled for the homo pirate you never got to use Changli on a proper team, Kuro is literally spitting on one of the most popular characters that saved the game when it was in a poor state."

This isn&#039;t a question of mihomo, it&#039;s a question of development deadlines between totally different game categories. Infinity Nikki makes a ton of skins, but guess what?
