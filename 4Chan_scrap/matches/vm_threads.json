One decent way to make distinct characters is to go by the 5e character sheet, where characters have an ideal, bond, and flaw. Here&#039;s some suggested ones from the archaeologist background as an example.Ideal: All my exploring is part of a plan to find the secret of everlasting life.Bond: I want to find my mentor, who disappeared on an expedition some time ago.Flaw: I have a secret fear of some common wild animal – and in my work, I see them everywhere.This last one is actually something I use for one of my characters, he will become terrified when a certain hostile mob shows up and will be totally unable to fight back. It&#039;s the little things that go a long way."

Her affection is physical and bold: fingers running through your hair, arms wrapped tightly around you after battle, laughter that echoes as she leans into your chest. By contrast, an Argonian&#039;s touch is cool, scaled, and often distant—affection filtered through a cultural lens shaped by the Hist, where emotion flows in quiet, symbolic currents rather than in open physical gestures. With a Nord, love is felt in every squeeze of the hand, every teasing shove, and every night spent tangled beneath a fur blanket, heartbeats thundering like distant drums of war."

        "text": "&gt;&gt;1864091Touch with an Argonian is a study in contrast—unexpected but deeply satisfying. Their scales range from smooth and supple along the neck, flanks, and face ridges, to firmer and ridged along the arms and back. When they hold you, it’s not with the warmth of flesh, but with a strength and stillness that feels anchoring—like being embraced by the earth itself. Their clawed hands, surprisingly dexterous, are capable of tender, precise affection: tracing lines along your skin with the careful curiosity of someone who values every small moment of contact. Their tail may wrap around you while resting, a quiet, instinctive gesture of possession or comfort. There’s no softness, but there is presence—a constant, steady kind of touch that feels like belonging.Taste is strange but not unpleasant, especially in moments of closeness—kissing or shared breath. Their mouths are shaped differently, often with ridged palates, forked or agile tongues, and sharp teeth kept meticulously clean with resinous herbs. A kiss is not soft or yielding, but careful and deliberate. The taste is mineral-rich and faintly briny—like iron-laced water or salt carried on wind from the sea. Depending on their diet, there may be undercurrents of smoked fish, bitter roots, or pungent swamp fruit. The kiss of an Argonian doesn’t melt—it lingers, cooling the lips and leaving behind a sensation like menthol or sage. It’s not about heat or sweetness—it’s about closeness, the exchange of breath, and the stillness between heartbeats."

Not only that, but the game has P2P private server hosting + mod support, out of the box, AND it is well optimized + tiny as fuck (literally like 3 Gigabytes, total).Thread theme song:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlUS4sXzdBM"

Never sets up his turret, doesn&#039;t platform shit but will always ping every mineral vein anyways. Tries to convince players to jump off high things saying he&#039;ll place a platform for them on the way down, never does, just watches them fall and die and when they ask &quot;wtf&quot; he just moves on without even trying to rez them because they wouldn&#039;t get it anyways because it&#039;s too esoteric for them. Loves hosting and shutting the game off moments before Molly docks in the drop pod. When questioned about why he does this he denies he does.&gt;MikeScout because it&#039;s the smart person class. Locks in and doesn&#039;t say shit in game, just gets everything done and effortlessly hard carries the mission. Was Legendary III all classes the first month he bought the game, doesn&#039;t tell anyone he plays it, goes on Dark Tide and other PvE game forums and talks about how shitty DRG is. Has 2000+ hours, never once used a mic, and is constantly worried that women and troons are going to kill the game."

My Windows 7 system with an identical RX580 8GB has a stripped 2022 driver which either does not autostart the AMD ReLive (GPU video recorder) service daemon, or I unselected it during install, or I slimmed it with a driver slimmer to remove the shit, I forget.I reduced the stuttering by slimmering the W10 drivers to remove ReLive in addition to any new spyware that I like to forget about by disabling it permanently, since I cannot yet monetize that spying to my benefit, but I have been mostly playing on W7 because I thought steam cloud saves were behaving a bit too unstable and inconsistent for my preferences, it was losing progress on me by not downloading the newest save before the game launched, and I do not always leave steamshit running in background.Yes, I do make sure to participate in the Hardware Survey button when it shows itself. I think I needed to slightly reduce my Windows10 steam usage, to help maintain hopefully helpful-to-gamers representation for Windows 7.Also, I see the OP image and I will raise you by one rare censored reddit post, it&#039;s craftsdwarfship is of the finest quality."

I have not been willing to reduce &quot;render&quot; below 100% because this feels like Contention in the Render Thread, too many calls seem to cause problems for a slowly increasing minimum CPU speed with each new update where 3rd party crap is added, and POSSIBLY made worse by ReLive or ShadowPlay, according to research.-disablemodding steam launch flag does not lessen the stuttering-when-spinning-dwarf on the W10 computer.It also happens if your dwarf is rotating while in motion."

Shoot them, grapple to nitra vein, reload and the bugs will take far longer to walk back to you.The insane ammo efficiency and ability to give teammates breathing room is also very welcome for coping with tards when the level 20 bronze 1 gunner with lead poisoning is too retarded to realise he walks slower than grunts while holding left mouse and eats 3 out of 4 bricks of the resupply pod because he&#039;s always at 14 health after a miniswarm.For anything bigger than a guard, there&#039;s always the shorty.t. 12222 Electrifying Reload + 11313 Jumbo Shells enjoyer"

Especially given how many shots you have to land with Subata Dets&#039; tiny mag size.More to the point it&#039;s not Driller&#039;s job to be focusing on these kinds of enemies.

Yes Axes are objectively lower reach but they are extremely accurate and predictable within their range, which is the kind of range Driller normally fights at anyway. And as I said anyway, Driller doesn&#039;t need to focus on things a million miles away to begin with.&gt;you cannot expect everyone to do what you believe their job to be 100% of the time with 100% efficacyYou also cannot expect teammates to never do their jobs at all. All three other classes have significantly longer range weapons than anything in their kit. Gunner has Minigun, Hurricane, Bulldog and Coilgun. Scout has GK2, M1K and crossbow. Engie has LOK1 and Shard diffractor.Building your class around the extraordinarily slim possibility that none of your team will have any ranged options is just foolish.

The inaccuracy, the slow firing speed, the ramp-up which is lost almost instantly when you stop firing, the terrible mod tree, and its overclock pool all being mediocre picks except for NTP which is so stupidly overpowered when combined with fear it breaks the game.Asides from NTP there&#039;s no reason to take it over the other options.

Since you are attacking the robot, the robot plays tower defense and you play the waves button clicker, since I am trying to keep it &quot;simple&quot; in the minigame sequence. Flappy Birds is better than minesweeper or solitaire. Maybe some obscure chess-like game like Hnefatafl (viking chess).Only slightly less retarded than flappy bird, but all my good ideas come from obscure 1990s pirate shareware half-remembered from Warez chroniclers like Fravia+ along with old FTP and Telnet stuff, and Java games from the era, when &quot;Flash Magazine&quot; (of walter jeffries fame) was a laser printer repair periodical, long before Adobe stole Macromedia Shockwave so it could kill it from public benefit some years later, just like big companies often kill everything that could slow their retarded money-grabbing that we get taxed for as an insult and a humiliation ritual."

Most of that won&#039;t come into play unless you play missions where you are in the same area for a while, but can occasionally come up when hunkering down for a random swarm. Recognizing those opportunities requires some autistic forward thinking to prep them before the swarm is even announced, but as a certified gunner autist the times I&#039;ve escaped overwhelming force by having zips already in place to kite around like a discount scout on dozens of occasions (with most of the prep not being impactful due to misjudging how soon the next swarm will be before the team kept moving)"

Most of the time crossing a gap, providing a speed boost, and breaking falls safely is more than enough. And honestly most of the time people don&#039;t even use the latter 2 of these 3 general use applications.Be honest, how many gunners have you seen that use the zipline&#039;s light to indicate where a complicated cave&#039;s entrance is to help people from getting lost during extraction?

All the 4chan related guilds were in shit like raidcall or teamspeak, and later in a steam group where we&#039;d do shit like play Left4Dead and whatever other flavor of the month games were out at the time. tl;dr: It was an actual community, but times of changed, or people have changed, but it&#039;s a dead community and no one hangs out anymore.

Technology was still advancing, and it gave you hope of a better future.&gt;Fast forward to present, you are approaching your 30s or mid-30s with no kids, no GF, still living with your parents. A normal life will be within your reach because you are supposed to own nothing and be happy. Everything went to shit, Jewish thought policing on the internet to push censorship, the mentally ill and degenerates were pushed in every facet of society, and the internet. And you couldn&#039;t relate to anyone or anything anymore. Speaking something &quot;wrong&quot; will get you ostracized and banned, or lose your job. Outside the window, you see niggers, jeets, and shitskins moving into your neighborhoods. Scamming people, poaching wild animals.

You can also do this as a human and support 1 Race. You may also challenge others to a duel.

Crafting is interactive.&gt;What are options for PvP?Combat pvp is there but don&#039;t expect to be rewarded for it as it&#039;s a dead forgotten system. Most of the rewarding PvP are from mini-games like guild battles, jousting, mafia, and some of festia.&gt;Are there limits on gameplay time?Not really. Some late game dungeons and raids have weekly caps but there&#039;s no energy/stamina system if that&#039;s what you&#039;re asking.&gt;Are the events for the game good and do they change every year?They change every other season or month, they are usually hit or miss. Right now they&#039;re running a big ongoing series of events which will be overlapping each other throughout the next few months, something that they&#039;ve never done before until now.&gt;Is the game social?Very, there&#039;s no real queue system so you have go out of your way to party up."

If they maintain a good update pace and the quality maintains I can see this game having steady success. Another game I recently have been toying with is Sword Art Online Hollow Fragment. I have played other MMO recreations as single player games but never one of the SAO ones. It is ok, moreso feels like a C-tier jrpg than an MMO world. I&#039;ll finish this and replace it with Erenshor which from what I have heard is fantastic.Besides video games I have planted a vegetable garden this year. I&#039;ve made a few salads and harvested some beans and cucumbers. My tomatos are either not coming in at all or are going to be late. They are tall but fruitless. I have also been patching up the grass with new seed. It&#039;s not going well, I might have to abandon this batch and throw down some fertilizer or just plain ol soil first. The ground isn&#039;t great in the patches which is probably why they are barren.I have not enjoyed any proper vacations so far this summer and I don&#039;t have any plans to take one. Work is slow and I have a lot of free time regardless if I have to work for 2-3 hours every other day.This is my blog. Now we don&#039;t have to chat outside of game. I look forward to chatting with you guys in-game later tonight when I am home."

However, a majority of gamers are simply not MMO players that will stick to one game for a long period of time. No matter what they did, it was never going to maintain the numbers near launch.It certainly could&#039;ve been a lot bigger though. Several fuckups on the developer and publisher side over the years. The combat gameplay itself is arguably still one of the best in the industry and one of the main reasons people are sticking with the game. All the other systems surrounding are typically what turns people away.FWIW, it&#039;s still one of the bigger MMOs, especially in Korea. Though even as a day 1 player myself, I&#039;ll say that the game needs big changes to succeed in the long term and the current director seems incapable of making them or even mentioning that it&#039;s an issue."

        "text": "It is strongly not recommended for new players to join the game. There are no new players in this game now. When doing some collection tasks, such as activity island, there is no one at all, and you can&#039;t enter the island without anyone. The dungeon is also extremely exclusive. It is not easy for new players to play the dungeon and watch videos to learn the mechanism. Sometimes new players don&#039;t know why the team was blown up. In this game environment, new players cannot make mistakes. There is no tolerance for mistakes. Of course, new players are unlikely to join the team. Picking equipment, engraving, gems, clearance titles, light card 30 awakening, demon damage, these are not something a new player can complete in a short period of time. Old players of this game have fixed teams. After many times of purification, they are referred to as &quot;crystals&quot;. They will not help new players to try and make mistakes at all.Of course, there are single-player dungeons, but the single-player dungeon gold coins in this game are very few, and half of them are bound gold and can only be used to strengthen equipment. However, props such as engraving books that enhance combat power need gold coins to buy. If you want to eat all 5 engravings, you need to grind for a long time in the single-player dungeon. Of course, buying gold can greatly shorten the time, but I can only play single-player, and I can&#039;t enter the team dungeon. What&#039;s the point?The biggest problem with this game is that the punishment mechanism is too big. If one person makes a mistake, the team will be blown up. No matter how skilled the old players are with the mechanism and how good their equipment is, they can&#039;t lead the team and have fun. For old players, the person who makes a mistake is the one who drags them down. They can only constantly filter the team and make the requirements for joining the team extremely harsh to reduce the mistake rate. This leads to vicious cycle of fewer and fewer newcomers."

Class ark passives are entirely different.Gender unlock classes are still distinct enough from the original to be considered their own class. People that like zerk will not necessarily like slayer in terms of gameplay. Same goes for pally vs female pally.&gt;&gt;1839415Depends what you do for fun in the game. The core gameplay loop is still basically the same, arguably more chill now than before at least.There&#039;s solo raids now I guess so you can still do some raiding even if you don&#039;t plan to play with others. Another piece of solo combat content coming out with the July update. Looks like after Kazeros raid is when the core gameplay might get a bigger shakeup but that&#039;s not coming until next year.Nothing changed in regards to MSQ, you still have to repeat it on other chars if you want to access content that requires it.

Fire from the incendiary grenade now spreads faster, occupying space rapidly to counter rushing Ts. The MP9 has gotten a bit of a nerf, with a harder to control spray and substantially less jumping accuracy. There&#039;s also a change to the CT economy: win or lose, CTs now receive a shared team award for each T eliminated in the round, so the more you win and the closer you keep your losses, the more you&#039;ll have to spend.[/p][p][/p]Trade Protected Items[p]Today we are introducing a new feature to help keep your Counter-Strike items secure. In the unlikely event that you lose control of your account or were the target of a scam by a bad actor, you may reverse all Counter-Strike item trades from the last 7 days.

The only time they weren&#039;t an absentee parent was when they fixed CSGO for a year or two after taking it over from hidden path. Every update they tweak or add a gun they massively fuck it up like they gave 0 thought to anything or even shot it in game once. Zoomers don&#039;t even remember when valve made the aug have the fire rate of the negev and less inaccuracy than the fucking awp for a week and made it cost less. Then we have the classics like the r8, cz, buffing the shit out of the sg and aug once again till pro play wasn&#039;t even ask and m4s for a year, tec9 buffs in the background while the cz was super busted making the tec9 a smooth transition over from the cz once they finally fucking nerfed it. Valve is a fucking joke and its a shame every game dev is too retarded and transgender puppygirl core to make a non hero shooter cause valorant might be bearable if I didn&#039;t get dogshit quips every time I load into a match while having my screen covered in 1 of the 20 flavors of smoke like I&#039;m a fucking moron and I can&#039;t tell smoke A from smoke B and it makes me feel like the game is more complex like dangling keys; ignoring the whole dumbing down every mechanical skill imaginable for complete droolers. The recoil pattern is going to be such an unnoticeable change in any high level play that its also fucking not even there. Do 1 match of deathmatch with it and you&#039;ll have the new pattern down perfect. The amount of turbo shitters I saw buying fucking random shit cause they think the mp9 is nerfed while smurfing today was fucking insane."
