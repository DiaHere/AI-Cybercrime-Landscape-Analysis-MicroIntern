Thats why you get those long uneven ripples. if you start getting uncomfortable dont panic, slowly loosen your grip and let go then pull away, everything has to be slow and steady. do a dry run over the metal to make sure your comfortable the whole way around. for flat welds like that id rest my right elbow on the table and hold the rod with my left hand just for the first few seconds then let go, try welding a bit one handed. The whole weld looks rushed. when you strike that arc you gotta hold it there for a second or two to let everything warm up and establish a puddle, At the end you do the same to fill in that end so you dont leave a big hole like you did in the last weld. Just dont rush and stay calm."

        "text": "&gt;&gt;2900660When weaving or walking watch the edges of your puddle. Ensure they&#039;re inline with what&#039;s just frozen. Usually you focus on one side and the other one will sort itself out from just natural movement(assuming flat welding and consistent feeding).I&#039;d just practice little weaves with no filler on thin stainless sheet(1/8th or less). So you can run a lighter shade and really see what amperage, arc length and travel speed does. Stainless color will give you a better indicator of how much heat you&#039;re dumping into it.&gt;&gt;2900690&gt;aluminum&gt;cheapAluminum is expensive to weld. Tig you&#039;ll need AC and amperage. Most cheap machines will have neither. And if they do they sacrifice quality or something else to get them.For mig(wire), Spool Guns attachments are an extra cost on an already noncheap welder. And now you&#039;ll need another gas bottle.If you&#039;re deadset get a cheap Tig Welder with AC and a bottle argon. It will teach you the most about welding. You will need 220v to do aluminum."

I think it&#039;s excess heat, but I&#039;m keeping a good puddle, and at the same time not penetrating enough. hard for me to explain, idk what you guys are familiar with. weak welds! I blow through the mild steel under the bung and end up with my puddle traveling up the threads. I let it cool for a while and hit it with a thread chaser and it&#039;ll be fine for a few turns but after I get to like 20 ft/lbs i take the bung clean off, leaving a lot of the filler behind. maybe it&#039;s bc it&#039;s stainless vs mild steel? maybe someone has an idea"

I want to mig weld steel using my mig welder, the internet tells me I want 75% argon/25% co2, am I being bamboozled? What should I expect to pay for a used cylinder, preferably q sized?

My area has TIG shops, a few autobody shops, a few engine block shops, so every process is possible for employment. I know stick is the best paying, and there are unions which employ (ironworkers, pipefitters, boilmakers, sheet metal). That said, after completing a 5 year trademen apprenticeship, I&#039;m not too keen on doing another apprenticeship. I do know that in my trade there are a few welding calls (which often are TIG/stainless steel or Stick to Galvanized; neither of which are ideal)&gt;why would you repeat? did you not figure out?Repeat is just more &#039;hood time. I&#039;ve asked if it was designed to be so, and they did say yes.I&#039;m currently in the intro class now, where we&#039;re given a demonstration of a process, then are given 2 hrs to recreate it. It&#039;s not that much time to master it, but I&#039;ve seen some students (even a chick) get it on her first time.They divide intro class into 2 separate classes: OxyFuel and TIG, thenStick, Mig/Flux, TIGI honestly prefer OxyFuel and TIG just because they&#039;re cleaner looking welds. I&#039;ve been ass at TIG so far. Getting good at stick to me, just seems like an occupational skill because I don&#039;t think anyone does stick for recreation.ok thanks for reading, I&#039;m rambling too muchAs for recreational options, it sucks because I can only see myself doing TIG/ OxyFuel welding on my free time.

Traditionally on MIG there is separate knobs for voltage and wire speed. &gt;Also, why not a chance for aly, though, if it&#039;s ok for steel?Because aluminium needs shielding gas, it is absolutely required, not optional. 100% argon is necessary. Secondly that machine will only come with knurled (teeth) feed rollers for the gasless wire, aly wire requires a U groove roller with no teeth. Thirdly, aly wire needs a teflon/plastic liner in the torch lead plus a brass or other neck liner in the torch neck. Fourthly, that machine has no way of changing the electrode polarity. That is because it is only designed to use gasless wire on steel, which is always negative electrode. Alu MIG welding needs positive electrode. And a LOT more than 120 amps."

Stick welding is the best process to learn welding with, but you won&#039;t use it much for auto except emergency repairs or outdoor building shit like trailers etc. Mig welding is much simpler after learning stick or tig welding, but not the other way.most body guys all use mig, since it&#039;s fastest for tack and spot welding and you can do it without a hood on fixing a panel in. also easier to use a whip one handed than trying to get a torch and filler in some places. most auto guys don&#039;t care what welds look like since they grind it all down, or just want it done quick(mig is quickest process).exhaust work, aluminum and fancy shit is all tig. though both are perfectly doable with mig.both processes require more expensive welders(though much cheaper nowadays) and shielding gas.Depending on cost of the class, I&#039;d just say buy&gt;a decent 180amp+ DC tig welder($400)&gt;bottle of argon($400)+regulator($30)+hose($15) &gt;1/16th S6 Filler Wire ($20)&gt;gloves($20)[leather], welding helmet($50-100)[tefawue], jacket or heavy cotton long sleeve shirt($40)&gt;4 1/2&quot; angle grinder($75) [bosch]&gt;scrap steel or whatever&gt;hours watching youtubeIf you have access to 220v you&#039;ll have a better time.

Still haven&#039;t even tried the SMAW on it, only the MIG. It is definitely nice to just dial in your material thickness and it puts a recommended wire speed and voltage up. I&#039;ve been just running their recommended settings and they seem pretty damn good to me. I will definitely be upgrading the mig gun to a 15&#039; as the 10&#039; is just too damn short compared to my miller with the 15&#039;"

I can&#039;t find shit online, anything I find about making a BBQ is just talking about hot plates and stuff like that.

You probably won&#039;t find a brand new pedal that will plug straight in. But it might be possilbe to retrofit a different pedal with the correct plug, which you would need to source from somewhere like RS components or Mouser. Then you would need to figure out the pin-out of that socket, this is more difficult. If it&#039;s 5 pin there is a hope that 2 of the pins are for the trigger, other 3 for the potentiometer/rheostat. Otherwise the trigger wires from the pedal will need to break out of the main cord and plug into those two banana sockets for the torch trigger. &gt;previous guy using it didn&#039;t seem to connect the ground on the 3 phase socket either and idk if it needs it or notIt definitely needs it, that guy is a moron. If he disconnected it because the machine tripped the earth leakage breaker with it connected, he&#039;s an even bigger moron and the machine is faulty."

I believe Lincoln sold a machine here in Ausfail made by that same manufacturer, the trigger was on pins 1 and 2. You could try poking a piece of MIG wire folded over into 1 and 2 on that socket, see if it triggers the HF. The other 3 for amp control I don&#039;t know, that would take trial and error. The value might be 1k ohms, 5k ohms, 10k ohms, something like that. Making pin 4 the wiper of the potentiometer would be logical but that thing is Italian so it&#039;s anybodies guess."

I&#039;m fit and do some basic lifting and posture exercise so I&#039;m certainly not gonna crawl my way home after the first day. that being said I always loved tinkering with stuff and basic electronics so welding should be alright for a job, if not then Imma look for doing chips or something."

Thin materials is where you will struggle with it because it will want to burn through.

If you plan on doing a lot of thinner material then a flux core mig would also be a good choice. Or mig with shielding gas would be even better. Once again, a multi-process machine would have all that covered in case you want to upgrade to shielding gas. Tig would have to have shielding gas."

I&#039;ve never seen so many ICs on a front panel PCB, that thing must be doing all the control for the entire machine. Why so many logic gates? and EVERY SINGLE IC is socketed?!? Insane, it&#039;s like they expected them to need replacing regularly. It&#039;s a lot more complex than I envisioned, could be more than 2 layer PCB, impossible to decipher through photos. Could only trace one track from that burned resistor over to what looks like a bit of PSU circuitry. If the other end of the resistor goes to pin 1 somehow, it could be that pins 1 and 2 are 2 sides of a voltage divider with the mystery 3rd pin which would be the wiper of the potentiometer for amp control. Pure conjecture on my part. Also it appears 4 of the PCB mounted potentiometers are broken. They should all have shafts poking out. Don&#039;t think there is anything more that can be done, put it back together if you can."
