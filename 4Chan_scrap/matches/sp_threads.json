Chicago as a whole lost it&#039;s vibe with rahm the man Emmanuel and really went off the rails with the female mayor. I respect her for trying especially during a crazy time but Chicago will always be corrupt. The only way ironically enough to stop the corruption is to divide the city into two parts. Everything down north ave should be considered south side and everything up north ave should be considered north side. It would divide funding to fix more of the center of Chicago then trickle down south of 35th Street. The North side generates a substantial amount of funding so they can privatize the south side and basically bring it up to speed and make money doing it."
