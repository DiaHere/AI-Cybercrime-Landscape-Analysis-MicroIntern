I suspect that he has been very careful about allowing his work onto the Internet in anything like high resolution. Or, even &quot;better than medium&quot; resolution.&gt;picrelFor example, I found this one embedded in a Wired article about him. While it&#039;s decent in total pixels, the quality has been gimped. Even the filename specifically says &quot;lowerqual&quot; in it. When You open it, it looks reasonably good, has an 82% JPEG compression, which is respectable but not great or pro.However, you can immediately see the image is rotted with upscale artifacts and just blows all sorts of detail with &quot;approximated worms&quot; wiping out all crispness and lines. Looks like someone wiped grease all over the lens and shifted the colors under artificial light. It looks &quot;good enough&quot; for someone looking at it on a 6&quot; or 8&quot; phone screen, but put it up on a decent 2560x1440 graphics monitor and it just makes your eyeballs scream in pain.&gt;&gt;7991870No. Upscales are cancer and destroying available image quality on the entire Internet. Every fucking zoomer retard is &quot;upscaling&quot; shit all over the place and poisoning search results so original images don&#039;t even show up in search results anymore. Just rotted out, cancerous sewage.&gt;&gt;7991291&gt;Stable DiffusionIs part of the cancer. It&#039;s shit."

Probably hasn&#039;t been more than cropped to the dimensions he wanted to post it to his blog.If you can&#039;t spot it immediately, use your browser to view the image at 200% and it should become very obvious."

I think nostalgia is a dangerous emotion, like depression and self-righteousness....but wow this whole thread has had me tripping down the memory lanes and it was fun. I had/stillhave no friends and read lots of books when I was young. Sometimes I&#039;d get tired of thinking stories out and looking at letters and would crack open one of these books, play the finding games and sometimes just stare at the pictures for hours, imagining myself to be a tiny toy soldier or the driver of a little car in some toy world filled with random shit. I did this off and on until I was 11 and then some faggot at elementary school had to point out that I was &quot;reading little kids books&quot; when that little white nigger couldn&#039;t even read a sentence on a billboard without stumbling. It bothered me that the book got attention focused on me so I put it away and forgot about it for 30 years, but now this thread has me thinking I will go read one this weekend. I really liked the ones with glassy objects. There were a couple with marbles that were galaxies of aimless adventure for my young mind. Thanks for sending me down a wave of nostalgia! I&#039;ll go watch cartel videos later to detox, gotta stay a psychopathic money-chasing adult or die, at least there&#039;s one day a week to pretend to enjoy myself.
