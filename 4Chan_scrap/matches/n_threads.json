There are people in this world that could mog most normies on a modern superbike using a dutch bike or a rikscha.A fixie, given the same rider, aerodynamics etc. will be going exactly as fast as a derailleur equiped bicycle at the same ratio. Change the conditions and the guy on the fixie will either spin out or grind hard, slowing him down. The other guy will just shift which enables him to continue producing maximum sustained power.Single digit improvements in drivetrain efficiency on the fixie are a purely academic discussion and for the shifter there will even be one cog per chainwheel where the chainline is straight and the discussion will be even more hypothetical.All this is true until something goes wrong. Things are more likely to go wrong on the shifter.The fixie is cheaper to run. It&#039;s potentially lighter. It&#039;s less prone to failure. It&#039;s easier to maintain. It let&#039;s you do things that are impossible on a freewheeping bike if thats your thing. It&#039;s quieter.TL; DR: The modern deraileur bicycle almost always offers better or equal performance and comfort. This is why it is ubiqitous in sports and transportation."

The next guy who seems to buy into a narrative where bicycles were somehow inteinsically limited to some speed and not merely governed by all sorts of circunstances external to them but then half way acknowledges that.&gt;&gt;2047483&gt;IGH master racewell lucky me im on an IGH daily but the response to &gt;&gt;2047472 would have completely missed the question that was specifically about&gt;deraileursand also unnecessary complicated by the fact that IGHs have so far consistently tested to have an overall worse drive train efficiency than deraileurs and single speeds (including fixies) which could potentially distract people who have no clear picture of the relation of aerodynamic drag to rolling resistance and drivetrain efficiency.Im curious, how did you sort out chain tension on a fully? Did you use a chain tensioner? Might aswell just derailleur in that case."

        "text": "&gt;&gt;2047484This is literally something I have alluded to. I have also gone on to explain that for every chainwheel there is onr or two cogs for which the chainline is perfect or close to that. But still, for some unknown reasons dimwits will never get this: At any sort of decent speed, like your 1 hr max, aerodynamic drag makes for 90% of all resistance. Rolling will make the rest. Drivetrain efficiency, being thought of as efficiency and not drag of course, is a factor that needs application to the total power of course. So at say 200 watts the difference, as indicated by &gt;picrelwould be a staggering 2 Watts! Wow I hope you shaved your legs. But the point I was making still is just as valid:Say you have a 48 - 17 fixie (or ss...) and you compare it to a derailleur equipped bike. You could put the 48 - 17 ratio exactly where your neutral chainline is. At that very ratio both bikes would be effectively the same (again: Save for the even less relevant jokey losses) and only once you shifted the deraileur bike would be less efficient but once conditions force that shift the guy on the single speed is physiologically far less efficient."

I like bicycles, which is why I own several bicycles, amongst them two fixed gears and a single speed. Yes they do climb just fine. If I really want to I&#039;ll even climb on my usual 48-17.It is not like you do not consume anything and it is not like its inherently a bad thing consuming things.But here is the thing (you) do not or pretend to not understand:There are physical pimitations to what one ratio can do. When descending you will spin out. It is physically impossible for you to spin past 250ish or whatever cadence. You might hurt yourself trying.The same applies to climbing: It is a simple question of physics and yes, while it is generally possible to apply more force to the cranks than what is equivalent to your bodyweight you generally don&#039;t and you especially won&#039;t do for long (you&#039;d be sustaining kWs at this point any might just aswell win any prestigious race in the world if you choose so). Again: You might hurt yourself trying.You&#039;ll especially hurt yourself trying to descend on a ratio that lets you climb 15%+ climbs or trying to climb on a ratio that develops 8m+. In any case you&#039;re phyisologically unable to produce certain power at very awkward cadences. Guess what: Deraileurs solve this issue.Idk but you havent ever ridden a bicycle if you do not understand this."

        "text": "&gt;&gt;2047810&gt;&gt;2047810So just to be on the same page here:You took short spokes, the hub and the rim and laced the hub in a radial pattern into the rim, using 2 or better 3 or more spokes. You then, without outting and tension at all on it, wound the nipples down and checked how much of a gal there is to the bottom of the slit?Or do you mean you just out two spokes with nipples in and you wanted them short so you can measure elbow to elbow? You know you can just overlap long spokes, measure and calculate the other way? Have you measured the spokes? Or do you simply trust they measure exactly as ordered? What do you mean &#039;you measured 2 cross&#039; and the LBS 3/2? This sounds alot like a rear wheel. Is it a rear wheel, I implicitly asked this before.Also come on its not that hard to measure effective ERD to below 1mm but keep in mind the hoop isn&#039;t perfectly round so measure several spots.Also the ERD being 3 mm off from official data means nothing. Who knows what they are communicating, nominal ERD, effective ERD? Using DT nipple? etc...The important thing is: How repeatable are YOUR measurements.So yeah this is confusing as hell please state what exactly what you want to know and what you&#039;re doing. All you need to do is really: Measure ERD or effective ERD using YOUR nipples, measure your spokes and optionally your nipples, measure your hub and either do the trigonometry or bash it in a calculator that you trust. I recommend measuring effective ERD using your nipples."

        "text": "&gt;&gt;2047820Sorry my dude yeah Idk where I got my mind ERD is &#039;effective&#039;. Meaning it depends on the nipples youre using. The &#039;gold standard&#039; is a DT Swiss nipple so many numbers published for ERD are based on that.Same question again: Is this a rear wheel? I am assuming it is.&gt;If I order the wrong length I can just have them do a 3 cross.Do you mean if it turns out your spokes are the wrong size for 2 cross they must be the right size for 3 cross? Highly unlikely. But there is no need for you to order wrong spokes.I repeat:Measure the spokes. This means get a ruler that starts at 0mm, no offset or such. Thin metal rulers work best. Inspect your spoke make sure its decently straight. Hold the ruler upright, 0 at the top, hang the spoke elbow on the top edge, see where the end of the threads land. Are your spokes 165mm? Write down what you get. Repeat the measurement 3 times as you do with all measurements.Spokes in two opposite holes. If using washers use them. Put Nipples on. Spoke end flush with bottom of slit. Calipers between elbows. Repeat 3 times. Repeat after rotating rim 90 degrees as it may be egg shaped.Measure hole circle on hub. Repeat 3 times. Measure flange distance and flanke width. Measure from locknut to flange. I keep drawings of all hubs I ever laced into a wheel. Making a drawing can help spot measurement errors.Read the instruction for the calculator carefully if using a software. Make sure you and the developer are on the same page what every dimension means.Just measure carefully and calculate or use a calculator. Then buy what you calculated. It&#039;s simple. Cant go wrong. If you repeat a measurement 3 times and the readings are close together you&#039;re probably doing things right."

It never rubbed but all the shit (road bike) that gets sucked through there can eventually wear the paint. This exposes the composite. The composite we see today is often designed to be relatively dry aka designed to have a matrix deficit. As such I am worried it could draw water when exposed but I have no source nor data on this actually being the case.Why do you want to run 28s? Is it just what you had on hand?"

I&#039;m not saying you are me or anyone else but desu 23s at 8 bar are absolutely fine for use on cobbles and gravel roads IMO. Again: I&#039;m not you and maybe your experience is different but I&#039;d say just try it and see if it&#039;s just a mental issue.So same number of gears? That implies same spacing and same OLD too (in general inb4 obscure parts) and you&#039;re good to go. It should shift, likely without any adjustment.Regarsing the clearance: Your choice. Like I said the paint may suffer and eventually disappear. But you&#039;ll be fine. IMO the whole &#039;pebble gets sucked up, wedges in there, locks your wheel and over the bars you go&#039; is a load of BS. Rode many miles on bikes with virtually zero clearance and things either dont get in there in the first place or just pop out the other end (after damaging your paint)/and in case of the front a stone might actually end up in the steerer causing a racket."

I assume from what you wrote it drops on random shifts, even in the middle?You wrote the chain is new. Is it too long? You did shorten it appropiately, right? In the smallest cog, is there still at least some amount of tension on the deraileur cage? It did shift with the old chain, right?

        "text": "&gt;&gt;2048870&gt;Planning on replacing Chain + Tires + Cassettechain: you need a chain tool to size a new chain to the gearing on your drivetrain. the tool slides the rivets in the links off and on. you put the chain around your biggest gears front and back but not through the rear derailleur, then you add link(s) to account for some length when you run it through the rear derailleur. up to 9 rear cogs is just one extra but you probably have more so probably 2 but I&#039;d check with Park or whoever.also more than 8 speeds you need a specific chain as well so buy what matches what you have. one of the links you add can be a quick link if you want. some need pliers depending on design.tires: you can sometimes just use your hands with a particular technique but if not then you need tire levers. mostly they&#039;re all the same but if you happen to get super tight bead tires (also rims can have an effect here) then it&#039;s really difficult. for that, the only ones that worked for me were Pedro&#039;s levers.cassette: against the smallest cog is a flange that screws down against it with splines inside it. you need a cassette cracker that fits your spline pattern e.g. Shimano. some other brands may be compatible with Shimano, I don&#039;t know. once that piece is off the whole cassette just slides off the hub no problem."
