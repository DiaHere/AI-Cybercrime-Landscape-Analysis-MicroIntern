If you&#039;re having trouble with your file manager for example, you will have a lot more success if you find what the file manager program is called and Google that specifically, as opposed to the distro nameYou can do anything in the terminal, you don&#039;t have to do everything in the terminal. Just because a guide sends yo to the terminal it doesn&#039;t mean there is an easier way to do it by GUIThe file system structure takes some getting used to. Everything in ~ (/home/your name or /users/home/yourname or something similar) belongs to you, everything else is global and/or system files. Note the leading &quot;/&quot;, it matters. /data/myfile.txt is not the same as data/myfile.txtThe Arch wiki has very good instructions for how to do specific things and which software you can use, even if you&#039;re not using Arch"

Do some reading into that otherwise your drives won&#039;t load. Also look at Linux paths too because you may install something but the command doesn&#039;t work. That would mean it isn&#039;t on your path.Bash is what interprets your commands and when you open a terminal that is what you will see.When you get more comfortable look at installing zsh and then oh my zsh which is a GitHub link with a theme you like. It&#039;s just a better bash which makes navigating the terminal a bit smoother, auto complete and all that. Practice on wsl."

You should not stay on mint, it has poor multi-monitor support and honestly nothing more then babies first step into linux world. I recommend you do EndeavourOS or Manjaro to get an arch based system. Comes with everything you need and gives you the right reason and setup to learn linux better. As you will need to mess around with terminal at a basic level to configure and download stuff. If googling is hard and you find things difficult to grasp. Then chatgpt, Google Gemini and Claude all works well to aid with basic shit in linux, just don&#039;t blindly trust them. (Chatgpt does not require a login to use as well. so that&#039;s a plus)Though be warned if you go EndeavourOS. It&#039;s being picky about the EFI partition, I tried to install it over my mint partition but It started crying about the EFI partition being 100mb only. I wants 2048mb, recommends at least 1024mb and as minimum requirement of 512mb. It also wants to install it in /efi and not /boot/efi.. So I had some issues getting it installed because of that. But so far EndeavourOS is fucking miles better then Mint."

Vmware is commercial, but just works and tends to be better at gpu things. Virtualbox also works. For better perfomance enable vt-x/vt-d.You can (and should to unbrick yourself when you fuck up) also buy a flash stick, burn an iso with livecd support via rufus, change boot order in bios or efi to try boot from a usb drive first, get welcomed by grub.Now.&gt;disable secure boot&gt;be precise with disk partitioning and partition formatting, one mistake can mean bye bye to your windows&gt;it&#039;s very ez to get fucked by a bootloader thanks to a typo, use that livecd stick to fix your bootloader config&gt;bad fstab == no bootable linux 99% of the times&gt;it&#039;s infinitely better to learn the system with a functional gui, but you should not avoid the tty. tty is your friend. btw wheel click pastes from clipboard and selecting shit within xterm copies it&gt;dont hurry, be methodical, dont overload yourself, take breaks&gt;read archwiki&#039;s articles about installing and setting the system up. even if you&#039;re not on arch (then rtfm the commands, dont be a c-c c-v monkey)&gt;check out your hardware, see if it has the drivers or needs to be worked on. lshw, lspci. if there are no drivers for your network card, u are fucked (it can be fixed, but it&#039;s not a trivial task for a noob)&gt;for typical wired just do ip link, then dhcpcd {whatever-name-which-isnt-a-lo}. for wifi, install wpa_supplicant. use wpa_cli to make a config for your network at whatever/loc/wifi.conf, then run wpa_supplicant -B -i {wireless-interface-name-given-by-ip-link} -c /whatever/loc/wifi.conf, then dhcpcd {wireless-interface}. should get you the internet. anything more complicated than that should burn in hell&gt;dont overthink about muh text editor. nano does the job.&gt;fucken google it. ubuntu forums have way too many answers to stoopid noob questions."
