I was a professional gd for almost 10 years working in both studios and on my own and I can&#039;t really find a job anymore. It&#039;s not even because of AI to be honest, its because of how the industry works and how bad the corporate environment has become. There&#039;s still web design, 3D and VFX/motion design(primarily 3D too) and if you want something similar or easy to transition then chose one of those but I&#039;m not sure for how long they will be relevant themselves because of the AI which is basically a final nail in the coffin of gd. Of course there are and will be exceptions and maybe you will get lucky to find some obscure local business that needs you, but if you are young and looking for a career in the future you should stop consider becoming a graphic designer. This profession is dead.",

        "text": "&gt;&gt;445768&gt;how the industry worksMy biggest problem with the industry is that it is ultimately aimed to reduce the workforce. The amount of different work that is done by one person today is the same amount of work that was done by 5 different people 10 years ago. And they pay the same salary for that. For that reason graphic design pretty much just vanished from existence because every single aspect of it can be done by other people in the field. So as a result &quot;designer&quot; profession was reduced to junior webdev monkey. Yes, there&#039;s still a chance to land a job but it&#039;s so small the majority of people physically won&#039;t be able to find them or it is already filled with nepobabies. Graphic design became a very very rare job. It&#039;s like a cartographer. &gt;how bad the corporate environment isIt is toxic and inhuman. Corps cucked wagies so hard they start to behave like black people in 1790s. The house nigger says shit like &quot;you can&#039;t deal with the competition, it is a completely fair market&quot; while working 12 hours a day for food with his weekend filled with obligatory critical race theory training. Even if you are skilled enough for a position you first need to fight the HR bullshit so the quota-bitch can determine if you are the right person to align with the &quot;company&#039;s values&quot; like selfies on linkedin how you can&#039;t go to office because of covid and now you are crying. You literally have to be a slave to the company, you can&#039;t have a life outside of it. And now we also have AI which will absolutely kill the freelance and small business clients. I think motion design will be gone the last because AI still kinda shitty at making videos, but it&#039;s only a question of time. UI/UX can also relax for maybe 2-ish years because right now AI is bad at small details and typography. Overall we pretty much witnesses of new industrial revolution, unironically. If you yourself have a graphic designer job I&#039;m happy for you, but please consider plan B."

Find something you like, hyperfocus on something, get yourself to draw a bit every day. Learn basics like perspective, quick gesture drawing will help a ton with drawing humans with more life to them. Don&#039;t get caught up in making everything perfect, the first things you make are gonna suck. Sketch things up, try going for 5+ variations of things to see what works best, forcing yourself to come up with more beyond your first idea helps creativity a lot. Look up tutorials if you get stuck on something. Can&#039;t figure out why something looks wrong? Draw that detail over and over to try to work it out. Lastly, don&#039;t rush it. Especially if you&#039;re not trying to make a living out of it, putting really any amount of effort into it will bring improvement."

All you need are a handful of small repeat clients who will rely on you to manage their marketing and brand presentation and you will be printing more money than you can spend. Shit, if you can learn enough of the skills required one client will likely be more than enough for youIf you&#039;re trying to string together a career based on overcharging for a logo every two months based on some golden ratio bullshit you learned in college then you never really understood the industry in the first placeAI is to Design like Quant is to Finance, yes it has it&#039;s place but if that&#039;s all there is to it any smart company knows it will be haemorrhaging money trying to narrow the massively wide scope that AI creates in terms of design language and targetinggl hf stop being poor"

Worked for mom and pop shops and for transnational companies. Had microscopic budgets and huge budgets. And yeah, I&#039;ve seen how the market deteriorates year by year. The breaking point for me was 2021, in the middle of the quarantine, although everyone was desperate for /gd/ services, nobody wanted to pay for them.

Yeah, the market has been deteriorating every year. I started in Branding and ads, but got chased out by indians doing my job. I jumped to package design and illustration. Got chased out by the chinese. Nowadays I live off editorial design. And work has done nothing but go up since 2020. I&#039;ve had to jump back and forth between career pathways but every year I learn more and more. Now I live primarily of being an advisor on printing matters. I&#039;ve learned a lot of traditional printing techniques and high paying customers pay big for me to print stuff and make really small runs. Curiously, the analogue stuff is making a return."

The upper tier will be fairly safe, bespoke graphic houses will always be in demand from corporate clients but when you can actually just use a template for $100 (a problem that existed also a decade ago), premade websites like Shopify with no little upfront costs, widgets and plugins that allow you to customize basic templates for a small fee to get that bespoke feeling.... why should smaller businesses pay for $5000 websites + yearly support packages with limited changes + webserver costs again when they can easily do it themselves for 1/4th the cost? Only the lowest dominitor businesses like local candlemakers who are clueless and never typed into google might give local design shops a go, which is probably still a lot of them but anyone who is remotely savvy will see the top three webpage results, know they can get a product that does 99% of what they want for 25% of the fee."

Pretending that I did seems like at best an unserious indulgence in hyperbole, and at worst a disingenuous distortion of reality.Bottom line is that society is not going g to collapse because some belly aching graphic designers can&#039;t just pick and choose from some smorgasbord of career level jobs that never existed, or have to adjust to new technology the way countless other far more important professionals have. Face it, lots of these people chose the field for the same reason they choose art and related electives in high school- they don&#039;t want to have to expend a lot of effort to get by, and it sounds fun and easy. That&#039;s a huge part of why the idea of replacing them is so appealing; they bring nothing to the table but think they&#039;re indispensible."

If you absolutely want to find something, try to find some niche design adjacent thing, like idk book restauration, live event design, some obscure shit, but keep in mind there&#039;s not a lot of opportunities. Or try to be one of those AI designers that will be hired to replace 5 interns for pennies. If you manage to get a real job in some of those places, keep it, don&#039;t even try to get anything else until contract is approved. No, honestly, should have gone for electrical, plumbing or anything else and do design gigs on the side."

Hugely oversaturated market to the point you literally have a 1000 people responding to every single job listing. Fiver jeets driving down the costs and availability of freelance jobs.The AI shit is just a nail in the coffin. Graphic design is going the way of poetry, just something you do on the side as a hobby."
