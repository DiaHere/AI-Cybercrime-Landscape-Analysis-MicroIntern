The idea being it would play with the concepts of the MC&#039;s identity, with the question being whether the MC considered itself to be the original human reborn, a new individual with its own identity, or a non-individual who only exists as the player&#039;s vessel (the player in-universe would have the role of a spiritual guide that the other characters weren&#039;t aware of until a late game reveal).What I&#039;m getting at is your choices should always answer the question &quot;why does this matter?&quot;"

The story I was going for it was like &quot;Blame!&quot;, spoilers for the blame manga I guess, but there the people in a dystopian world basically lost access to their rapidly expanding technology because it can only be accessed by humans with a specific gene who all died out, so our party would be working under the assumption that they actually found a human in a dumpster and try to go through hell to bring them to a net terminal to make them able to leave their city/cluster and restore the world/contact between each other (they&#039;re all non human but not like monsters necessarily but human-ish variants that evolved to be different in the future), but anyway long story short once they&#039;d get to the end they&#039;d find out he wasn&#039;t actually human but as a robot they&#039;d still be able to work the terminal to see it&#039;s all kinda fucked anyway and wouldn&#039;t have worked which is eehhh it&#039;s work in progress I wasn&#039;t really set on a downer ending it&#039;s just like one possibility I had in mind.

The world takes shape the moment you bring in darkness from a fully realized dark world. Before that its nothing. It&#039;s standees of shops with generic symbols like FF1 on NES that dont even function. Built by ralsei or not, the world has no identity before you came along and gave it one. No other dark world reacts like that when you bring in other darkners, hell the opposite happens and it rejects those darkners after a long enough time. It has to have no cohessive shape to begin with, no intent for where the world is supposed to go or what the creator specifically wants to see.

What prompts the Kris and Susie to go there is Susie realizing a bit too late that Noelle is extremely upset (If she did offer Noelle to come over too, she denied it outright), and they end up being unable to call either her or Carol. They go to her house, we see how Kris sneaks in for a bit of comedy, the front door&#039;s unlocked and they can see darkness pouring out, the rest plays out as you&#039;d expect. Noelle doesnt need any push from the Knight to do this, she still remembers the &quot;Dream&quot; and likely tried it on a desperate whim to feel better."

The titan doesnt count because not only is it pretty much a beefed up wild beast, you dont get the choice one way or the other.

Even if you kill Flowey he rubs it in your face that he was right, and if you spare him the game doesnt continue you to show the consequences of that anyway. I want him to prove he does think there are times where killing is justified and that it&#039;s a deliberate choice you need to make, instead of saying everytime you get the chance to, no matter the situation, it is always a moral good to let it live.tl;dr its personal beef now, I dont think deltarune will be a worse story if it doesnt happen"

He was a misanthrope, kind of like Chara was to Frisk, who heard about some plan to end the world and get Dess back and was all-in on it. But now that they&#039;re learning that there&#039;s more to life than just brooding and being an edgy angstlord, he&#039;s having second thoughts and that&#039;s resulting in the seemingly contradictory behavior. He wants the Knight to beat his team and take Toriel, but he fights extra-hard when Ralsei and Susei are down because he can see with his own eyes the consequences of going along with this plan. He wants the Knight to take Toriel because he thinks she&#039;s a two-timing bitch, but doesn&#039;t actually want Toriel to die because he knows she has some good in her with how she saved Susie. He knows that for his plan to work, Susei, Ralsei, Dess, Noelle, everyone he knows may have to die, but he doesn&#039;t want to be the one with blood on his hands as seen in the weird route. He put his body in the hands of some potentially sociopathic alien who is treating his struggles as a video game, but doesn&#039;t want to live with the consequences of his life becoming a video game that ends up with his new friends getting hurt.In short he&#039;s just a dumb teen, and he&#039;s just dumb and depressed enough to be manipulated by every single adult who had his ear just before we came into the picture. He would have done anything for them to make them happy before Chapter 1 started and we&#039;re seeing the fallout of that. He has the kind of personality that drug addicts who start when they&#039;re young have."

Compare, for example, a blind first run and a second run where the player is hunting for secrets. I missed the Devilsknife, Shadowmantle, and Gerson&#039;s hammer on the first run and sold items I could have combined. A bit of knowledge makes the player much more powerful.We cannot communicate directly to Kris and even if we pick the most benign options, there is no guarantee of not having an ulterior motive on our part (even if it&#039;s something as banal as hooking him up with Noelle or Susie). He&#039;s clearly unhappy about being possessed and it seems to be a means to an end for him. This end looks to be the conspiracy he&#039;s mixed up with. Bringing the player in on the conspiracy (even without knowledge of Gaster and whatever his motivations are for summoning us) is too much of a risk and these delicate plans are too easy to disrupt.tl;dr there are lots of reasons to be hiding stuff from us and things could go off the rails badly if he wasn&#039;t guarded.
