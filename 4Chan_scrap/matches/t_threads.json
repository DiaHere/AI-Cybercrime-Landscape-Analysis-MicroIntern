        "text": "RARBG MAGNETS AND HOW TO USE THEMEVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOWPart 1/2---RARBG was one of the best-known and largest public torrent trackers for media. It died in May 2023. The official reason was various accumulated troubles maintaining the site, but it&#039;s suspected that the actual reason had to do with the new-ish copyright laws in Bulgaria that were lobbied by international media giants.RARBG IS DEAD.This is a HARD FACT.Some random shitty websites nowadays are pretending to be &quot;new rarbg&quot;, &quot;the rarbg&quot; or similar. DON&#039;T TRUST ANY OF THEM. Not even &quot;rarbg 2&quot;. Not even &quot;rarbg official&quot;. Even back when RARBG was still alive, there were copycats like this. Best case scenario, they&#039;ll give you a poorly organized collection of magnets from random places and try to sell you some shitty vpn. Worst case, they&#039;ll redirect you to dangerous websites with malware scripts.Consider this: Any good service or product doesn&#039;t need to pretend that it is supposedly some other service/product.Consider also this: There is nothing on these shitty clones that you can&#039;t find on much more trustworthy public trackers, like below. You _don&#039;t need_ these &quot;new rarbg&quot; clones for anything.Actual decent alternatives for 2025 that picked up RARBG&#039;s flag: https://torrentgalaxy.to/ or https://ext.to/---While RARBG was alive, some people were archiving its torrents/magnets. Now that it&#039;s dead, several different collections are floating around online, in different formats.I highly recommend that you use THIS one:magnet:?xt=urn:btih:ulfihylx35oldftn7qosmk6hkhsjq5af^ This is the original upload, shared by the person who collected and posted it. There are also some reuploads of this by other people, which have a different hash (different magnet). You can use them too, it doesn&#039;t matter, as long as the actual file inside is the same:rarbg_db.sqlite - 775 MiB - CRC32 checksum 3F03CB95(it&#039;s usually inside a smaller-sized .zip archive, that&#039;s perfectly fine.)Continued below."

        "text": "Part 2/2 - Continued from above &gt;&gt;1345446Why use THIS one?- It has ALMOST 3 MILLION magnets from RARBG. It&#039;s the largest one.- It&#039;s a DATABASE - &quot;kinda like&quot; a special set of Excel tables for efficient searching. MUCH better than some unwieldy text file.- It has EXTRA INFORMATION about these magnets, such as torrent size and more.To view it and search it, install https://sqlitebrowser.org/ or any other SQLite Viewer/Browser/Editor/etc.Open the file rarbg_db.sqlite in this Browser. Go to the &quot;Execute SQL&quot; tab there.Write the following and press Ctrl+Enter or the &quot;Play&quot; button:SELECT printf(&quot;%.2f GiB&quot;, CAST(size AS FLOAT) / 1073741824.0) AS size_gib, title, dt, printf(&quot;magnet:?xt=urn:btih:%s&amp;dn=%s&quot;, hash, title) AS magnet_link FROM items WHERE imdb = &quot;tt1745960&quot; ORDER BY size DESC;&gt; SELECTa command to pick certain data and arrange it as follows&gt; printf(&quot;%.2f GiB&quot;, CAST(size AS FLOAT) / 1073741824.0) AS size_gib,the first column in the table of results will be the size of the torrent. it&#039;s stored in the db in bytes. this formats it to gigabytes to be readable&gt; title,next is the title of the torrent&gt; dt,date of the upload to RARBG, to help you guess if it still has seeders&gt; printf(&quot;magnet:?xt=urn:btih:%s&amp;dn=%s&quot;, hash, title) AS magnet_linkthis assembles a ready-to-use MAGNET LINK from hash and title. you can COPY it from the table of results with RIGHT CLICK&gt; FROM itemswe&#039;re searching in the table called &quot;items&quot;&gt; WHERE imdb = &quot;tt1745960&quot;we want only the entries that have the &quot;imdb&quot; field matching Top Gun Maverick&gt; ORDER BY size DESC;results are ordered by size, largest to smallestSome torrents don&#039;t have an imdb field. Either they are not movies, or the uploader messed up. To find them, write this instead:&gt; WHERE title LIKE &quot;%Top%Gun%Maverick%&quot;Use % before and after and between words, like this. It&#039;s a wildcard for text search. You don&#039;t know how EXACTLY each torrent is called (&quot;Top_Gun&quot; or &quot;2022 Top Gun&quot;?)Beware, this is much slower."

        "text": "&gt;&gt;1346615&quot;Stalled&quot; is a poor/misleading - but sadly established - name for &quot;I don&#039;t see any peer who has more parts that I need&quot;. Basically, it&#039;s &quot;paused because no one is seeding right now afaik&quot;. The client doesn&#039;t consider the torrent &quot;done&quot; despite what the name might imply. It just doesn&#039;t have anyone to get more data from right now.&gt; does this mean its no longer actively searching for connections?Your torrent client is searching for new peers regularly. It connects to trackers and to DHT at set intervals, which is somewhere in the settings depending on your client, but it&#039;s *most definitely* a thing that it does because otherwise torrenting wouldn&#039;t work at all. Also, you can manually send a reannouncement to a selected tracker at any random moment if you want.Also, if you&#039;re connectable, then those other peers can discover you even in between your own client&#039;s periodic discovery attempts. For example, you last pinged a tracker at 16:02 and your next ping is set to be at 17:02. Meanwhile, at 16:23, a new peer who has more than you have connects to the tracker, and the tracker sends him your IP: &quot;this guy has 23% and hasn&#039;t sent me a message that he disconnected, so he&#039;s probably still online&quot;. Then this new peer&#039;s client can connect to you at 16:23 to send you data, even if your own scheduled next discovery is at 17:02. But only if you are connectable (= your port is open and your machine is reachable).&gt;Ie if a new peer connects and starts seeding, will it automatically start downloading again or do I need to stop/restart it?To sum up, yes, it will.Side note, clients usually have status options for torrents like Download / Pause / Force Download, but this Force Download only means &quot;Download despite any other additional rules that might be present&quot;. That is, it overrides settings like &quot;no more than 5 torrents downloading at once&quot; or &quot;seed only until ratio = 2.0&quot; etc, and will download or seed anyway. This has nothing to do with stalled torrents."

It&#039;s not an attack vector that propagates well, but fearmongers love to bring up the possibility of it - however astronomically miniscule it is - to dissuade people from using torrents.&gt;&gt;1346395RuTracker has Russian and very often Ukrainian.Complete Blurays in any source where they exist typically have a good few audio tracks in different languages, because they are literally a full copy of the entire retail disc.I&#039;ve seen some uploads on TorrentGalaxy that have English + Italian, I think they&#039;re often uploaded by the same user.Spanish, idk. If you know the language, can&#039;t you ask people from Spain or Latin American countries whether they have their own locally famous torrent trackers? I bet they exist."

The action of unzipping the archive doesn&#039;t launch the files that are inside it.And the action of downloading the files (through torrent or otherwise) doesn&#039;t launch them, either. You and you alone can hover your mouse over some ImNotAVirus.exe or AwesomeScript.vbs and double click it.It&#039;s safe to TRANSFER/DOWNLOAD any file, or CREATE a file on your hard drive by means of unzipping a .zip archive, etc.It&#039;s not safe to RUN / EXECUTE / LAUNCH a potentially malicious file, which is an entirely different action altogether.(and it&#039;s also not safe to visit shady websites that want to pwn you)If you instead meant &quot;compressed&quot; in the sense of a special format of .exe files that obfuscate their contents from antivirus software etc, then it&#039;s still an .exe file that you shouldn&#039;t run/launch unless you trust it. It doesn&#039;t matter what the exact build method of it is. And as a regular end user, you don&#039;t know this anyway, to you it&#039;s just some .exe file."

It&#039;s consistently, *always* over 7 GBs. I&#039;d accept this explanation if they ranged from 6.98 to 7.02 (or something like that), where the goal for encoding would obviously be 7 GB. But they are always 7.02-7.04 decimal GBs (which translates to ~6.55 binary GiBs).&gt;&gt;1351373This kind of question is meaningless without your location and your intentions. (the latter is somewhat obvious in a torrent thread, but still).&gt;&gt;1351865Peer discovery between clients happens through trackers and through DHT (and also through other peer exchange mechanisms which are a distant third). If both peers use the same mechanism, they&#039;ll find each other eventually. If they are on different networks / different trackers / etc, they won&#039;t find each other.If these trackers are working for you (you connect successfully) and they are also working for your intended leechers, then yes, you&#039;ll be fine. If not, then you won&#039;t find each other. The more options to discover you you enable, the better. Also, if someone copies the magnet link without the trackers (deliberately or accidentally), then their client will be looking for peers only in DHT and won&#039;t find you. Also, various automated DHT crawlers and other magnet scrapers archive only the magnet hashes (and the content) and completely disregard suggested trackers, even if they find a magnet link with trackers. So, for example, if someone will find your upload in the database of such a DHT crawler / scraper, then he won&#039;t have the URLs of the trackers that you provided, and therefore won&#039;t connect to you. (but I guess that you&#039;re probably more concerned about the initial seeding to people in some thread, not about what happens months and years later)"

Their &quot;original source&quot; is scene FTPs. From there, they are reuploaded to all kinds of trackers, first to private ones and then to public ones and also various random blogs with filehoster links etc. They don&#039;t have a &quot;source tracker&quot;.Also, some &quot;local&quot; music releases (originating from some tracker or forum or whatever) might be tagged in a similar manner, but the releaser (tagged at the end) is not a scene group, but some local releaser of some tracker, or the release is outright credited to the tracker itself (like -TT for TranceTraffic).Random assorted titles =&gt; fuck knows, it could be from anywhere.For movies, it&#039;s similar.&gt; The.Critic.2023.2160p.AMZN.WEB-DL.DDP5.1.H.265-FLUXThat&#039;s by the release group FLUX, which may or may not have a &quot;home&quot; where they upload the release themselves (idk about FLUX, this is just an example), but then this quickly gets distributed everywhere.

If the release (and the movie itself) is popular, then this release is uploaded to a dozen places, with minor differences like these misc txts.Some trackers have their own internal groups that release stuff. These might or might not get leaked to public sources.&gt;Joes.Palace.2007.1080p.AMZN.WEB-DL.DDP2.0.H.264-PTPThis is from the private tracker PTP, and by their internal releaser, but it&#039;s been leaked at least to RARBG in 2020 and probably to many other places.&quot;Random&quot; filenames (not structured like above, or without a releaser credit) are anyone&#039;s guess.

These have a Russian audio (and usually no orig language audio) and built-in ads in the video stream.These are telltale names of releases by Ultradox (fka Koshara), a Russian pirate website / releaser group, which cater to the lowest common denominator. Their main focus is pirate online streaming, but they provide files as torrents too. Their target audience is the ultra-normie, not-tech-savvy type of Russian users who don&#039;t know any better and eagerly watch stuff as online streams with flying ads and interruptions. These releases are useless for international viewers b/c they don&#039;t keep the orig audio, but what&#039;s interesting is that Ultradox have a WIDE network of suppliers and get their hands on rare stuff from the most obscure fucking sources. For example. I like the actress Charlotte Hope and follow her work. Her recent-ish TV series Catch Me A Killer was a joint South African / UK production (the story takes place in SA) and it originally premiered exclusively in SA on some local streaming service or TV channel a month before the worldwide networks (Amazon etc). Inexplicably, Ultradox got their hands on that South African stream immediately upon that local release date, and they also got one of their translator teams to produce a voiceover Russian track for it within days (Ultradox is a &quot;releaser&quot;, but they have close ties with some Russian-language translation teams, and commission exclusive voiceovers/dubs from them). I mean, do YOU know where to get stream grabs of a South African streaming service? Or some HDTVrip of some Chilean TV movie? No one in the &quot;international&quot; warez scene has that shit, yet Ultradox routinely manage to get their hands on such obscure stuff. It&#039;s fascinating. Useless for English speakers (unless it&#039;s the only source of the movie/series that you want), but still fascinating."

I seriously doubt that btdig&#039;s bots regularly crawl 4chan&#039;s html pages in search of magnet links in the text (that&#039;s waaaaaaay too specific), but their crawlers eventually picked this new hash (and its file contents) through DHT, by connecting to me or to him or to somebody else who might have grabbed it. By the time this torrent was in our clients, there&#039;s no way to trace it to the web page where it was posted.So either there&#039;s something readily identifiable in the contents of the torrent, or sometimes this or that tracker lets you search by hash (to quickly check whether such an upload is registered on this given website), or otherwise you&#039;re shit out of luck."

I&#039;m also aware that there is a newer thing called DV / Dolby Vision, it&#039;s the one that looks green and purple on incompatible screens (and/or GPU drivers etc?)I&#039;m familiar with what HDR &quot;does&quot;, I mean the color spaces and all, but since I don&#039;t own a HDR screen, I never had a reason to tinker with HDR releases of movies. My understanding is that most(?) modern 4K blurays nowadays are not only just HDR, but also have DV baked into them.Recently, I grabbed a specific 4K bluray (full disc, not rip/encode) from a private tracker for a friend who requested it. In the MediaInfo / Bluray Disc Summary report, I noticed that it has two video streams inside it: one is the expected high-bitrate 3840x2160 HEVC stream with 10 bits and BT2020 etc, while the other one is a VERY tiny 1920x1080 stream that is less than 100 MB, and apparently this is the DV stream.Am I understanding it right that any DV release can be turned into a &quot;regular&quot; HDR release by simply remuxing it into a new video file with removing this secondary DV stream? Is DV essentially a hack that adds an additional small stream of additional info, while the actual meaningful imagery is in the main HDR video stream?Also, for archival purposes and preservation, let&#039;s say a movie or a TV series exists as three different webdls, from one streaming service:- SDR- HDR- DVSDR and HDR are obviously different, but is the DV release simply the same as the HDR release (+ small DV stream), so for archiving / data hoarding I can keep the DV version and make the regular HDR out of it by remuxing, if needed at some point?Also, am I wrong in some other assumptions above in this text?Do I need a special type of screen to correctly view DV releases without manual removal of this additional stream?"

It&#039;s nothing special and it&#039;s just an aggregator, but if you were using TGX for new stuff, extto will get the same job done. Scene releases and p2p releases are the same anyway across trackers, it&#039;s only a matter of how fast they are reuploaded and/or indexed.Consider the four big Russian trackers. Obviously you&#039;ll need a translation tool (a browser plugin or similar) or just remember where to click after the first few times, but don&#039;t disregard them.- rutracker.org. It&#039;s better to register an account, which unlocks usable search and gives other quality of life things. Downloading magnets is available even when you&#039;re not logged in, but it&#039;s just easier to use with an account.- rutor.is = rutor.info (two domains, same website). You can easily search and download without an account. There&#039;s also a rutor.org which is FAKE and demands that you pay for a paid account to download torrents. Don&#039;t do that. But it connects to the same database and its search engine behaves a bit better (rutor.is&#039;s search won&#039;t find Django Unchained if you query &quot;django 2012&quot;, but .org&#039;s search will). It&#039;s useful to search on BOTH websites and then download the torrent you need from .is/info (the url format and the torrent ID is the same anyway).- nnmclub.to. You can easily search and download without an account. A few torrents here and there can demand an account, but it&#039;s very rare (a remnant of earlier times when it did demand an account).- kinozal.tv. Having an account is mandatory and this tracker keeps track of ratio, like private trackers, but anyone is free to browse through their library of torrents, and registration is unrestricted.Rutracker = by far the biggest library of (very!) well-seeded torrentsRutor = typically fastest releases of new stuffObviously, torrents here have Russian audio added to them, but otherwise they are the same bdrips and webdls and remuxes as anywhere else."

I saw that an essentially identical release of this same thing was dead on another tracker, and decided to revive that torrent. It was a release by a different release group / person, but it was the exact same disc.When I re-checked the hash of this dead torrent against the downloaded folder, there were a couple tiny mismatches, which resulted in a few pieces/parts being missing (so the torrent was at 99.8%).Specifically:- There were minor differences in some files in /BDMV/JAR and /BDMV/PLAYLIST- /BDMV/MovieObject.bdmv was different between them- The /CERTIFICATE folder was missing a couple &quot;online.*&quot; files- More precisely, ONE of these torrents had the contents of /BDMV/BACKUP fully match the contents of corresponding files in /BDMV, whereas the OTHER torrent had the contents of /BDMV/BACKUP being different from the files in the main /BDMV folder that they are meant to be a backup of.On a whim, I tested it this way: I copied the files from /BDMV/BACKUP/JAR into /BDMV/JAR (overwriting the differing ones), and now the piece/part of the torrent that these files were in successfully passed the hash check.The actual video files of the disc perfectly match between the two torrents/releases, of course.How does this happen? Outside of some weird fuckup, what can cause this? It appears that one of these two releases had some of the files (in JAR and PLAYLIST) deliberately modified, while their /BACKUP/ copies stayed the same.Does this have something to do with different methods of copy protection removal?----&gt;&gt;1358931Thanks, that&#039;s interesting. The torrent in my screenshot is genuinely 47.28 GiB (binary GBs, I checked it with the client to make sure), and the main STREAM folder is 47.27 of it. There are no duplicate large files.

        "text": "&gt;&gt;1363705If a torrent is dead with no seeds, then it&#039;s dead and can&#039;t be revived out of thin air. Rarely, it&#039;s possible that there is a lone seed somewhere and you two aren&#039;t connectable to each other for some reason, and *maybe* if someone else joins the torrent then he can get data from that unconnectable seed and transfer it to you. But this would have to be a freak accident, and not a realistic model of reviving torrents.When people offer to seed, they mean one of these two:- They have free disk space and don&#039;t mind joining some (presumably rare) torrent to keep it alive. They download this torrent and keep it in their client, remaining a seeder and helping it stay alive for now.- Many torrents of movies, music etc are not unique. Let&#039;s say a release group released a bluray rip, and over time this release got uploaded to a few different trackers, some of them private and some public, sometimes the torrent has just the mkv, but in other cases the re-uploader made a folder with movie.mkv + bestonlinecasinos.txt. But the actual video file is almost always kept intact. In this case, if the torrent that you want to grab is dead, you can ask around for someone to grab this same matching file from another source (like a private tracker) and to join this dead torrent while having the video file from elsewhere, as a seed, which will &quot;revive&quot; the dead torrent.With all due respect, your two examples that you want are fucking AWFUL for revival, because, well.. WHAT are those torrents, exactly? The magnets are terribly non-descriptive. Where did you learn about them, where did you find them? Do you know who made these compilations, where they originate from? Did more than 1 person ever seed this EVER? It&#039;s some random &quot;knowledge&quot; folder. Maybe even the author updates it every month and you came across a long-dead version from a random month. You can&#039;t hope to revive a random magnet. Learn where this came from, and look for alt ways to get that."

There&#039;s over 100 files in here with a data rate less than &lt;1000kbps, they won&#039;t even look good on a phone.For your own sake OP, if you&#039;re using these for your own projects then I&#039;d say you&#039;re best off to just start again but at a resolution from a post bronze age era. And when you do, again, for your own sake it&#039;s probably worth the time to rename the files so half of them don&#039;t start with FREE BEST ROYALTY FREE INDIA.&gt;Inb4 just upscale it broNo, just don&#039;t hinder yourself and waste time with such poor footage.There are plenty of free resources outside of YouTube to get stock footage, and the ones that are on YouTube often have the raw uncompressed file available somewhere for free. Mass-ripping from channels may save you the time searching but will cost you time in editing.&gt;pic related, op why do you even have shit like this saved?"

If I mess about with newer variants they get bricked after a couple days. What I suggest is that you do vmware virtualisation on a newer version, then crack it with the painter crack (adobe.snr.patch.v2.0-painter works). Once you have confirmed that it works you set a restore point. Then every time it bricks itself you go back to the restore point. It is tedious though."

I repackaged the archive because the original contained a passwordDon&#039;t even try feeding it to virustotal. It&#039;s going to explode. Also I tried running the keygen in a Windows Sandbox but apparently it requires to run along the main process that it&#039;s supposed to generate the activation code for.

You can always transcode on the fly later, or produce secondary copies from it if desired.For example a giant 4K library at home, and compressed 540p or 1080p variants to stuff onto portable storage if you travel alot and can&#039;t always remote into your home NAS.

I can save a 4K PNG in 1MB or I can save the same 4K PNG in 1GB - the 1GB one is not 1000x better, it&#039;s only 1000x bigger"

If it can&#039;t simply be &quot;lossless&quot; then it&#039;s not lossless and quality is lost in the process regardless of efficiency and perceptual quality per bit.Stay mad faggot.People with brains and money know a 10GB video in h.264 ain&#039;t shit, and compressing further with meme codecs or otherwise is a waste of time. Non retards will just buy storage or compress their shit however they want without trying to convince others that their lossy encodes are lossless. You can have opinions, but you become a fucking retard when you start blatantly lying about things and making up lies to try and fool people into thinking previous lies were not lies."

But compressing is quite nice, why have 10GB if you can have 1GB and it looks indistinguishable from the source?How much you can compress the video before it&#039;s noticeable, depends ultimately on the video. If it&#039;s extremely bloated, you can compress more.&gt;&gt;1330741&gt;you can cut the bitrate in half encoding it to H.265 and hash-for-hash it will be identical; visually losslessThe second you re-encode the file, the hash will be different. Even if you encode losslessly. Even a remux can alter the hash.Unless you&#039;re talking about PHash, in which case, that depends on how accurate you have it set to. It can look garbage and still have the same PHash.&gt;I can save a 4K PNG in 1MBIf you have a 1MB 4K PNG, it was originally shit quality. Also videos are not PNGs. Anything worse than CRF 0 will have their pixels altered.&gt;&gt;1330663&gt;Transcoding a terabyte of videos to save 2/3 of it isn&#039;t worth the loss in detail or the watts spent computing the transcode. It&#039;s easier and simpler to just store them as is. Storage is cheap, after all.Yes, storage is cheap, but remember, you&#039;re not storing only those videos, you&#039;re storing a bunch of other shit, and while storage is cheap, it&#039;s not free, especially when you might need to buy additional big drives.It can save vastly more than just 2/3 depending on the user aswell as how efficiently it&#039;s encoded. If you encode with NVENC H264, sure you&#039;re not gonna save much. But if you encode with software using AV1, you can save a LOT.How much you can save depends on how much each individual cares about the quality. Most who torrent just want better than stream shit, in which case you can compress very hard and still have a significant upgrade over stream shit.Either way, her pack doesn&#039;t take up all that much space, it&#039;s sub 1TB. Most people download only the videos they want. Archivists will have multiple 20TB drives anyways.The H265 torrent someone made looks dogshit."

However, the champagne has definitely lost some of its pop, the show does not carry World Peace&#039;s mantle as dynamite social/political commentary (to be expected somewhat as Sam and Nick are hitting 40), and the recurring MDE programs in their current configuration don&#039;t hold the same entertainment to carry fans until the next full-budget production: Fishtank is straight zoomzoom garbage, The Sam Hyde Show is spouting the same old commentary on the same doomer topics that have been covered for the past 5-7 years and is also a lame attempt to reel in the new generation of Dear Elon doomer larpers with the call in thing, and Perfect Guy Life is like a bunch of your childhood friends coming over too constantly and running out of interesting shit to say.I am seriously wondering whether MDE will be a shadow of its former self if it ever makes it into the mainstream, like its creators seem to be aspiring to."

Being constrained to 11 minutes per episode in WP meant that sketches had to be over far quicker. The Nick and Charles breakup sketches in WP were about a minute, and it had a start, middle and end. The 2 ones we have seen so far just drone on and one for 6-7 minutes, and there&#039;s not even a joke at the end? Like where&#039;s the funny.Another thing that annoys me is how static every single shot is. Watch the Erick Hayden CEO sketch and just focus on the cinematography, and then pick any sketch from EP and it&#039;s night and day."

Now he&#039;s at a point where he knows this works, so he can keep doing the bare minimum and they will eat his slop day in and out.I&#039;m even a fan of Fishtank, but admit it&#039;s just another failed project, thanks to sam, his incompetency and those retard staff members he has around him (majority of which, im sure are just big sam dick suckers who allow themselves to get under paid). In the end, I&#039;m as im sure with a lot of people, it&#039;s turned into a watch what releases with maybe 1 to 2 friends who are also kinda fans or interested to see what comes out.

All the kind of good to only bad sketches have been self contained or two parters. Every one they&#039;ve taken over like 3 minutes in total runtime has been a massive steaming failure. the short list of ok sketches &gt;Charles the streamer pt1/2 &gt;electricity hookup sketch &gt;... actually drew an entire blank trying to remember a single thing ok from 2 or 3 the first half of the first of 3 niggas watching tv skits that devolved into lady ballers? can&#039;t remember a single other sketch from that episode, it was wall to wall daddy dom. If that had been constrained down to just black guys watching Sam Harvey it&#039;d have been pretty funny, everything after that first 40 seconds was as bad as everything else. They die with time, this stuff doesn&#039;t work if it isn&#039;t paced properly. The AI sketch if about half the length might have been good, it&#039;s definitely the highlight of episode 4. The homeless guys with hammers thing they repeated 4 times to fill out the rest of the episode. What kills me is if they had 2 not nick and some random black guy cop actors play the cholo robot e n t i r e l y straight and they just had the robot get torn apart by dominicans it&#039;d have been the funny sketch version of the conversation nick and sam had about it years ago. Maybe not the best joke at the end of the day but it&#039;d at least have had the social commentary beats that were in what they&#039;d already done."

With pgl, scuffed realtor, he just became oversaturated...perhaps spread too thin, and the funny gems are hard to come by. Refreshing to see Sam actually acting here, like he&#039;s so unfunny in extreme peace it&#039;s honestly baffling. Is this what constantly chasing money does to someone? Was he just stressed out the whole.time they were shooting? Or was charls correct in his Turkish assertion that the heavy lifting is done by everyone around him? I mean obviously this is true, but he was at least fucking funny. You watch wp1 and it&#039;s a completely different person, I mean can you even imagine him playing roles like the gay guy, the news reporter, the woman at the IVF clinic etc?"

He calls people disgusting and gets visibly upset at ugly folks while blowing his nose or spitting on the floor.Actually I had stopped watching years ago because he once showed worms on scalp for no reason.Charls is just fucking retarded.When I think I used to take his spirituality/kino arc seriously back in 2017, I mean I was young and all but damn. This guy keeps talking out of his ass. And because a subject needs a bare minimum of effort, seriousness and memory to be debated, and this crackhead has none of these, he will just say nothing exist, and everything is fake. Out of pure laziness and paranoia lolHe&#039;s also the only one who is actually racist, like in a dumb, insecure kind of way.Sam is also but part of it is a grift, Nick is not really because too pragmatic and manly to be that hung up on something.A real weird moment when Chris Lynch shared a video about Israel not granting citizenship to Jews from Uganda, and sterilizing ethiopians women.Charls was glad about it, and said &quot;why don&#039;t we do the same?&quot; and both Sam and Nick looked at him in disbelief.Sounds like nothing but it was revealing about their true character: Nick is a cool dude, Sam and Charls especially are mentally stunted weirdos, and most importantly, miserable. Let&#039;s be real, they couldn&#039;t even operate in the real world without internet cash cows."

Fishtank might be degenerate trash, but Jet is fucking good looking girls off it. Sam might be begging on stream or selling cashgrab merch, but it still allows him to buy properties, cars, clothes, luxury foodie shit and stuff hard working normies can only dream of.I&#039;m not saying this to defend Sam, I think he&#039;s a shitty person who made it big due to having some degree of talent and now he&#039;s coasting (enshittification of MDE) but in the grand scheme these guys came out on top and setbacks and missteps aren&#039;t hurting them like bad fortune does to normal people who never made it.Even the Harland podcast works out in their favor - negative press is still press, and Harland&#039;s stupid ads for Israeli AI web design companies are getting twice as many views as a normal guest gets him. As shitty as they are, these guys are still winning at the end of the day due to the nature of modern fame/celebrity culture. It would take much more to undo the privileged life Sam and co have been lucky enough to live."
