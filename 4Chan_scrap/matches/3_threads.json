        "text": "&gt;&gt;1013968This is less of a /3/-specific topic and more of a general &quot;how can humans compete against AI&quot; topic. The answer is always &quot;they can&#039;t.&quot; Any and all digital work is theoretically completable by AI with higher efficiency than a human. All excuses - &quot;AI can&#039;t stick to prompts,&quot; &quot;AI textures look sloppy,&quot; &quot;AI topology makes no sense,&quot; etc. - will pass away in due time. This is just something that digital artists will have to deal with."

Traditional artists that worked for their skills will be completely screwed, but the upside is that Indy artists and developers will be able to create things that would match AAA studios that can only produce slop.So with Ai for Art, programing, 3d modeling etc. Everyone will be able to produce all kinds of games and share them.The problem is how everything has to be a service with monthly fees. You cant own anything anymore, its a dystopian nightmare if Ai is controlled by Globohomo corpos who will only exist to charge you every month for access."

        "text": "&gt;&gt;1013968I just tried it with 4 examples and all of them had sloppy parts or misunderstandings of how things work. The first one was some bug monster I found on the internet which it completely misunderstood, second one was drawing of a dragon which turned out to be flat for some reason. Third was gigachad who looks nothing like on the picture, and still has sloppy details like nipples and fingers, and the fourth one was the most simple, almost t-posing woman which still failed on the clothing making nonsensical lines but turned out to be the best outside of the face. Its still very similar to the previous techniques and lacks proper everything else. So I assume that like every demo they showed the best of the best only.&gt;&gt;1013971Yeah, produce images that nobody likes on the internet. In most cases AI can still be told apart from real digital art, and it has been 3 years now since the whole AI art thing began.2D artists still exist, people still keep making films after Veo3 and Sora was released, and Google&#039;s released movie with AI scenes made by Veo3 still had to be for the vast majority of the movie be made traditionally. AI still struggles to stick to the prompts even in 2D. Yeah it looks good but you can tell, and that is what is important. Not to mention that artists aren&#039;t the only ones getting screwed over, digital artists in U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics graphic designers have not been hit as much, still having positive projections for employment unlike Programmers and Cashiers.https://www.bls.gov/ooh/sales/cashiers.htmhttps://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-programmers.htmhttps://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htmAnd here you also have data from 2024https://adplist.substack.com/p/state-of-the-design-job-marketSo even the 2D artists that have been &quot;decimated&quot; are still somehow finding easier time getting employed then the average white collar worker.Maybe one day"
