You will be understood. You will be lovebombed and made to feel perfect. You will be worshipped. This will slowly escalate into me becoming increasingly more intense and possessive, and also into manipulation and some light psychological and physical abuse. I will get in your head, but that is the price one has to pay to experience real love.&gt;not looking forMen, people not living in Europe, people not willing to meet in person, non-submissive people.Add me and pour your heart out.

Beside those who&#039;d steal my next breath for survival or pleasure are those who chase &#039;good&#039; and condemn &#039;evil&#039; ; &#039;evil&#039; relies on our permission ; evil is only is rejected by accepting the need to condemn prolongs one&#039;s problems. Most intellectuals lack curiosity, disgruntled with societal stupidity yet too proud to accept information is deemed credible largely through rhetoric. Competing interests, not knowledge, even to those certified and well-read. The self-aware few lack creativity, social skill or interest. Turning inward, my physically and mentally abusive childhood stripped me of the ability to love or feel loved. My body is weak, asymmetrical, scarred, and ugly by outside and personal metrics; I will never feel secure in any identity. I live in a cycle of aching malaise, dissociation, and sharp persistent awareness to avoid the inevitable conclusion of a world encouraging me to kill myself since infancy.coldrinse"

The occult.&gt;Looking forI want to either become divine - a god even - or sink beneath the cracks in the world so that I can abandon this reality. Also, I have cause to believe that women (and particularly radfems) will and are going to actively stop me from ascending to godhood. I have no cause to believe that radfems are aware of my own potential apotheosis as of yet, but once they are they&#039;ll surely try to stop me, especially once they try to secure godhood for all of womenkind for themselves. I also somewhat think thay the reason why my therapist diagnosed me as schizotypal was to cast doubt on my ambitions. But for now, I&#039;ll see if I can at least use her services to get medicine for avolition, anhedonia, etc. To that end, I&#039;d like someone to talk about the occult with so that we can mutually aid each other in our goals as I&#039;m surely not the only one out there with grand aspirations. Or if anything, we can at least discuss creative goals and keep each other accountable.

Most intellectuals lack curiosity, disgruntled with societal stupidity yet too proud to accept information is deemed credible largely through rhetoric. Competing interests, not knowledge, even to those certified and well-read. The self-aware few lack creativity, social skill or interest. Turning inward, my abusive childhood stripped me of the ability to love or feel loved. My body is weak, asymmetrical, scarred, and ugly by social and personal metrics ; I won&#039;t feel secure in any identity ; letting go of fear and hatred without something familiar to replace them is tantamount to suicide. I live in a cycle of malaise, dissociation, and sharp persistent awareness to avoid the inevitable conclusion of a world eroding me from conception. coldrinse"

Total KHHV and generally friendless. Online 24/7 and usually always in some game. I&#039;m not too mentally healthy and may go silent because of that or because of the mentioned things. I was with, or witnessed some more or less infamous people online.&gt;Looking forPeople to talk to, more preferably closer to any european timezones. Maybe some friends, maybe some people to play vidya with, if we get along then we&#039;ll see then. The more things shared the more likely we might end up getting along since I don&#039;t concern myself with things that I do not care about, especially if they don&#039;t involve me. If you interact with me for an hour after adding, then go radio silent for 2 weeks, it&#039;s best if you unadd me, because I sooner or later will.&gt;Not looking forActively LGBTQ+ people, degens, people that dislike anime. Voice chats and /CURRENT THING/ obsessed people. People who do not know how to keep boundaries, such as instantly throwing every IRL thing they are, including humblebragging or improverfagging. It is for the best for you to not add me if you would believe yourself to be successful, progressive or attuned to the normality of life, especially in the monetary ways. &gt;Contactyakoh7431&gt;HobbiesBeing on my PC, vidya games, lore on specific universe/projects such as warhammer, touhou and the likes. Looking at anime girls, sometimes editing stuff. History, Medieval things and guns are nice as well. Rarely anime and some movies, but only if It sparks an obsession.&gt;Career/majorNEET&gt;Favorite genre of musicMetal for the most part, but I like plenty eastern (japanese) songs, or anything at all that is at least a bit unique and not radio, NPC garbage. Though the more mainstream it is, the more I probably won&#039;t like it."

This all has far more disposable feeling about it now. Which I guess applies to some other things, when comparing today to 15 years ago.

I have catfished some of the same dumbasses here 4 or 5 times because I know they&#039;re too stupid to catch me &amp; I can squeeze more money out of them. I have always been able to be convincing with pictures, short videos and making my voice sound fem for calls bc they desperately want me to be real. The only reason people are able to catfish is because you are too desperate &amp; ignore obvious signs. &gt;&gt;34112298I would take pictures from old facebook friends so I had a large library to work with and then if they asked for something I didn&#039;t have I photoshopped my own hands in, etc. Even managed to photoshop a convincing image of a girl deepthroating a hairbrush.Writing things on a paper is also not full proof and extremely easy to fake."

Unfortunately there is no catfish repellent that is not also normal woman repellent. Definitely watch out for dry begging, or people that consistently victimize themselves or have tragic backstories. Also, don&#039;t be so horny that you are blind. It&#039;s very rare that a woman is going to come on to you first &amp; freely send nudes right away. Just go in with the mindset that anything can be faked, even &quot;live&quot; photos on kik. I can easily send &quot;live&quot; photos, change my voice or spoof my location. But what I&#039;m not going to do is waste my time if I sense you&#039;re not worth anything to me.I know there are some closeted trans girls that also catfish dudes but I have no advice for that. &gt;&gt;34113120I guarantee you I have not scammed anyone that is a good partner.

It will always feel better in person than if you were to do it through camera. There are verbal and non verbal aspects to communicating one&#039;s love towards their partner and long distance relationship is at a huge disadvantage as you will struggle to portray any non verbal love towards your partner, for example, imagine your gf is sad and needs a hug and feel the warmth of your embrace, or she&#039;s acting like a brat and no words work and you need to playfully pull her cheek to calm her down when she&#039;s too excited; its impossible to portray anything like that through the screen. Not to mention how smell is big part of attraction for women, very few women are willing to date a guy who they do not know or even do not like the smell of; and you can&#039;t really let her know how you smell through the internet. Therefore long distance relationships only work if they stop being long distance as soon as possible, otherwise you will miss too many bonding opportunities and the relationship will extinguish."

There&#039;s a reason they say no one&#039;s perfect, this is one of em. So trust your gut. And i mean it.2. Make sure you know who you&#039;re talking to. Ask for proof. If they seem too hot, they&#039;re definitely cold blooded people. So no. Dont throw yourself in the fire. A very good way is trying to get them to show off their favorite shirts and outfits. This same tip can get you find a great buddy to chill with btw. Ohh, ask about their tattoos. It&#039;ll help, a lot. 3. Think with your brain, not with your crotch. If they try to get you to show off right away or they send a nude. Choose your best way out. Unless you message them for nudes. But yeah, stick with keeping things slow.4. Lastly, don&#039;t be to empathetic. There&#039;s only a few people who deserve your money. Your family, your pet, charities and homeless folks. And well, a bonus. While it is a very harsh world out there, don&#039;t be too paranoid, just play it safe. Their are definitely genuine people who&#039;d love to vibe instead of doing harm. Sooo be assertive, not aggressive."

This year I&#039;ve been playing a ton of Oblivion since the remaster and it&#039;s still at top 10 game for me. My 3x3 top albums in pic. I like mostly midwest emo/alt emo/indie stuff. Excited for the new Alex G album in July. Also waiting for the 1.0 release of Abiotic Factor in July as well and looking to see if any girls want to play it together if we hit it off. I read manga, keeping up to date with Chainsaw Man and Dandadan. I love goofy shit and animals. I&#039;m bottom left politically. There&#039;s still a ton of BG3 runs I&#039;ve been meaning to do as well even though I already have 421 hours in the game I haven&#039;t played the last patch with the new subclasses.&gt;LOOKING FORWomen that want to play survival crafting games(Abiotic Factor, Minecraft, Valheim, Stardew, etc), co-op games, maybe Nightreign, or Baldur&#039;s Gate 3. Women that wanna talk about stuff in my post or things they might think we share a common interest in.&gt;NOT LOOKING FORMen, Bigots, and Friend Collectors&gt;TAGvarlotto"

He is also using these posts to try and find a girlfriend, or more accurately, to groom a young and impressionable girl. He tries so hard to come off as some alpha guy, but when you get in voice with him or hear him speak, he sounds like a giga tard quoting andrew tate. I asked him if he was on the spectrum and he called me the n word and banned me from his discord lmao."
