But I personally prefer the simpler ones just for doodling, if I had an option to just draw with the same tools of windows microsoft paint 95 with a bit less fucked up workspace and proper shortcuts I would."

I gave it a try too and found out because the UI and commands are exactly similar to autocad, I could immediately use it without having to &#039;adjust&#039; or relearn things. Then I found out that it&#039;s actually affordable, with perpetual license. I can actually afford it with my own salary if I want for my own personal use! Tempted but that&#039;s for later. Other Foss shit that I&#039;ve tried was Freecad. I hated it so much. Oh, how do I turn my model? Only on the gizmo? . How do I sketch on this surface? Wait, I have to make a plane first? I can&#039;t just sketch and the program automatically make a plane? Okay, I have my sketch, where the heck is the extrude command? It&#039;s not called extrude? You have to click a few extra tools to activate it? Okay finally found it, gosh, it&#039;s called offset. Goddammit. Where the heck is that arrow to set how far to extrude.. Wait I could only type in numbers? Agh. Now the program doesn&#039;t want to extrude, gives funny bool error message. Screw it.

OpenCanvas, ArtRage, Artweaver and even fuckin Paint.net were years off when the groundwork for Krita was being developed.

Part of the reason Free Software exists is because Stallman couldn&#039;t fucking fix a Xerox machine at his university because it was all locked down, when the prior model could be user-modified when problems occurred. And he went to several people to try to get the ability for the computer nerds to mod it unlocked and they stonewalled him, due to money.Free software will always be cutting edge in that sense as the modifications still have to come from SOMEWHERE, and people who prefer being unimpeded by corporate chicanery will still gravitate to it."

I&#039;ve installed 5 different distro in a day for testing.The reason I suggest linuxmint is because it&#039;s the most popular which means if you encounter something you don&#039;t know you can just ask the forum or somewhere else.As for performance significance. It&#039;s noticeable even on my gaming desktop. I don&#039;t know what windows did, let&#039;s just say Krita feel like an Open source software. The tools are laggy, the load is kinda slow. On Linux it&#039;s took half a second to load. What drawing/painting software load within 0.5 seconds. The tools are instant, the brush doesn&#039;t even lag at high resolution.The drawback is, LINUX. It takes learning, it takes reading, it takes troubleshooting and a lot googling and being patient. If you can&#039;t do this, stay within the windows bubble. But at least debloat your spyware os."

It makes Traditional and Digital look like blood brothers. It&#039;s honestly a lot closer to how 3D CGI works than regular art (even though you&#039;re still hand-drawing everything). In both traditional art and regular digital art, the range of values you manipulate are limited to &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white&quot;. Black is your darkest pigment, or the darkest your display can get, and white is the color of the canvas/your brightest pigment, or the brightest color your screen can produce. For both traditional and digital, white is limited. Limited to your physical viewing conditions for traditional, and to the max brightness of your screen for digital. But in real life, there is no upper limit to how bright things can get. The sun is incredibly bright in real life, to the point where staring at it hurts.So the crux of my workflow is that, rather than paint on a canvas that directly maps to the screen, I paint on a canvas that is completely unlimited, where I am able to make things as bright or as dark as I want them to be. So, where a normal artist would make the sun RGB(1.00, 1.00, 1.00), the sun in my image is actually like RGB(8055.00, 4136.00, 11.00), or something like that.Now obviously, displays can&#039;t show the full power of the sun&#039;s brightness. But I can take the raw data and &quot;tonemap&quot; it. Best part is that I can tonemap to both SDR and HDR, if I want.It honestly feels like cheating, since beyond the initial setup, my workflow is basically just &quot;multiply flat color by light color&quot;, but that&#039;s just a testament to how powerful this really is. And hey, video games and 3D CGI use the same style of color space.tl;dr I paint with light."

Obviously I didn&#039;t invent an entire industry. I simply put two and two together for its use in 2D art. And honestly, I wasn&#039;t even the first to do it -- that tutorial in the Krita Docs was written by someone else. I had independently discovered a similar methodology for about 2 years before I discovered that tutorial.But I&#039;m not even in it for the glory -- it really is just a better way of doing things. Colors mix more accurately in linear space and when you&#039;re not artificially constraining yourself to a limited domain of luminosities. Imagine how ridiculous the field of Mathematics would be if, regardless of what numbers you input into a formula, your output can only ever be at most 255. It&#039;s ridiculous, and yet, artists everywhere constrain themselves to that limitation.&gt;&gt;7619686Sadly no. I&#039;m not the best with words.If you want to dabble in working in such a space, the first thing you want to do is make a canvas with a 16-bit floating-point bitdepth. This will let you work in scene-referred space. Painting in such a space will largely be the same experience that painting in regular 8-bit integer space is. Only difference is that, rather than colors going from 0-255, they go from 0.00 - 1.00 (for now).Go to Settings &gt; Dockers &gt; and click on LUT Management. This docker will have a slider called Exposure. If you slide it into the negatives, you will find that your image appears to darken, but you can also pick colors in the Specific Color Selector beyond 1.00. You are now painting with HDR colors.I really do need to create a proper tutorial video for getting this workflow set up, though, as there are a lot of complex concepts all intermingling together."

But you can do just about anything you could do in a traditional workflow. &gt;And I personally find it suspicious no one discusses this method on the internet.I don&#039;t. It&#039;s an incredibly obscure workflow for 2D art (half the people who know about it are probably in this thread), that has a very specific set of benefits that most 2D artists don&#039;t really require, especially for the amount of knowledge and setup required to utilize it. And even for people who would benefit from it, there are workarounds you can do in a traditional digital workflow that doesn&#039;t require you to relearn everything. If you&#039;re the kind of artist that just picks colors and paints them on top of the canvas, you don&#039;t need a scene-referred canvas, and in fact, it may actually slow you down. Tools like SAI and CSP don&#039;t even have color management, and simply assume artists will only even need an 8-bit integer perceptual-gamma canvas, since for 99.999% of artists, that&#039;s all they&#039;ll ever need. Even programs that do use scene-referred space for image data manipulation don&#039;t necessarily expose this to the end user. Photo and VFX often focus on editing already-existing data, and 3D CGI abstracts the working space away from the user, letting them focus on the art portion while the program itself calculates lighting.Even I, which had a use case with my lighting-focused artwork, only really discovered this workflow by happenstance, and even then it was after two entire years after I started drawing. Before that, I would create 16-bit integer canvases (not scene-referred, 16-bit integer still maps 0 and 65536 to black and white). I had been &quot;faking&quot; a scene-referred workflow by using intentionally dark colors, then using a Color Adjustment layer to brighten the whole image."

LLMs are usually very good (from my experience) at giving clear instructions on how do a specific thing in a software, and I have used in the past to help me find specific options or features in Krita before. Much easier then skimming through multiple youtube videos or trying to navigate a bloated handbook that doesn&#039;t have a clear answer to my problem."

Layers, as far as I&#039;m aware, don&#039;t really have borders - they dynamically resize to fit what you draw in them, and can include content outside the borders of the canvas itself. If you need to move two layers to a different spot, your best bet is to move them together -- select both layers and use the move or transform tools."
