        "text": "&gt;&gt;8409462(1/2)It&#039;s likely because what you described seems like a whole game&#039;s set of mechanics by itself, and the game you gave as an example further proves that. I’d also argue that part of the appeal with including impregnation in an H-game is seeing the reaction of both parties to the possibility of impregnation, to pregnant sex, or post-birth sex. That is to say, the narrative impact on the nature of the sex scene. For example: &gt;A woman in a loving relationship shyly telling her boyfriend/husband that she wants a creampie and try for a baby, being a big milestone in their relationship. &gt;A rapist taunting his prey that he’s going to impregnate her and get off to the rapee panicking or pleading. &gt;The pregnancy factor in any given sex scene and both characters referencing it, like “Be gentle, don’t hurt the baby.”&gt;Mentions of having given birth in the dialogue, with the couple either trying for more or just getting back to having sex again. That said, I have a game to share that partially meets your request, and I think approaches it in a pretty unique way: the Goblin Burrow series by Peperoncino. You’re in control of a nest of goblins and your job is to go out and capture heroines to breed and give birth to stronger goblins through skill trees and stat inheritance. There’s a surprising amount of complexity and the difficulty spikes can be pretty challenging, so it’s legit a game to sink your teeth into for quite a while and enjoy the rape scenes as you do."

        "text": "&gt;&gt;8409689(2/2)But in terms of the rape scenes, there’s a hell of a lot of variance. There’s four types of goblins each with a different type of scene schtick: &gt;Regular Goblins - gangrape&gt;Hobgoblins - mindless huge insertion&gt;Goblin Shamans - either magical restraining or hypnosis sex&gt;Goblin Champions - sadistic huge insertion&gt;Goblin Paladins - possessive arrogant rape with some crude taunting&gt;Goblin Lords and speaking in coherent sentences to break seebeds with wordsEach heroine also has three sanity states, and their appearance and personality in scenes change depending on which one you’re at (and you can modulate it to your liking with food). &gt;Refusing: Resistant - still largely clothed&gt;Submitted: Lost will to resist - naked&gt;Lewd: Completely mind broken, begs for more - chained and collared. Then you have a sequence of sex scenes to pregnancy scenes to birthing scenes, and then you can get right back to matching the heroine with a goblin to impregnate her again. All the while you need to consider how to work within limited resources and time to get the best goblin horde possible, so there’s gameplay integration to the pregnancy parts. There’s 18 heroines in the base game, with 4 possible goblin types, each goblin type having three scenes (one longer one for initial sex and two shorter ones for subsequent mating), three mental states for each of those three scenes, one pregnancy scene and one birthing scene for each mental state, and finally, one first rape always with base goblins. This isn’t counting two intro scenes, two mental threshold scenes, and one suicide scene. Napkin math, that’s 655 sex scenes just with the base game, to say nothing of there being more heroines in the sequel Ill Bourne, plus a fairy tale-centric spin off, a Sengoku-centric spinoff, and multiple DLCs for all of these games that each add a pair of new heroines. Not quite randomly generated, but practically not that far off."

        "text": "&gt;&gt;8409462Well, like the other guy said, a lot of preggo games make that a pretty huge portion of the game or completely sideline it. Personally, my favorite is Hazumi and The Pregnation. Super simple RPGMaker game where you play a freshly minted adult woman and you whore yourself out and get knocked up to pay your rent. Very casual smut game and really short if you&#039;re shooting for the actual ending."

        "text": "&gt;&gt;8409462unfortunately, it might also be because there are just more attractive/degen genres to the people who play these kinds of games. It&#039;s also a lot easier to change a regular h game into an NTR game with the addition of a few lines of dialogue and maybe an added extra male character. Pregnancy becomes it&#039;s own game mechanic, needs more specified art for each impregnatable character, more specified scenes and someone who really knows what the fuck they&#039;re doing when it comes to not leaving their story elements either with a ton of loose ends or contrivances that gum up the consistency of the game.That being said, I&#039;d fucking kill for a solid impregnation game where a human Male MC isnt a little bitch getting reverse raped all the time and there&#039;s more than 1 or 2 female characters to impregnate with actual scenes instead of a still image with a png of sperm hitting an egg.Wish I had better suggestions than what have already been mentioned so far but I don&#039;t."

At least that sounds plausible enough and generally matches what I see on the H-games front.

And since most of the artists out there in Japan are just freelancers who take commissions (There&#039;s artists on staff, but they tend to be background artists and the like, the characters themselves are usually farmed to some big name doujin fan artists like Butcha U, just so they can slap his name on the box, and just get &quot;cleaned&quot; in house to make it fit their own internal artstyle better.) they&#039;re not getting paid extra to go from 3 months, to 6 months, to 9 months or something like that. Think about it, a single of those monthy periods, a dozen different expressions, a few different poses, that part alone would be like 40-50 images. Do that with a single girl and it&#039;ll easily balloon to 100+ images. And with the standard issue 5 girl band that most visual novels and nukige go for, that&#039;ll be hundreds if not a thousand or so more images that you need to farm to an outsider. And outsider who&#039;s charging premiuns, and like all artists, they&#039;re not good busy bees and working drones, no, they&#039;re out there doing dumb shit like taking &quot;Mental Health Days&quot; just so they can go play the Elden Ring DLC.So most of the time, they just tell them to make a single pregnant set of poses and CGs for the character and they call it a day. Out of my own memory, I think Swaneye are the only ones I&#039;ve seen who make different sets for stages of pregnancy, then again, with an art style that&#039;s only marginally better than Lucky Star, I&#039;m not surprised at all."

Thats the difference between a studio shitting out a product and an enthusiast with a passion project. the passion project is going to be far more autistic in its approachof course, between the 2, i think impregnation is a vastly larger &#039;fetish&#039; than actual pregnancy, so thats where most of the focus goes"

But most of the important details remained in place. You could just do a few hundred of these images over a few weeks and have your art assets ready, just getting rid of the real wonky stuff, This one here would go to the garbage, simply because I told the AI to make her pregnant and mastubating while breast milk is leaking out of her nipples. You can see that she&#039;s clearly not pregnant. So to the garbage it would go. On the other hand, this could be a returning pregnancy CG, just clean up the mistakes on gimp or photoshop, place it at the end of the sex scene, just add the standard insemination cutout from a manga page on the corner, add some dialogue along the lines of &quot;ah! I&#039;m being bred again! my breast milk is leaking&quot;.Point being, with some time, someone dedicated enough can come up with the assets for free.

So, here&#039;s a quick and gross oversimplification of the classic process, good old Stable Diffusion:You start by picking a Model. This is the man thing that does the work, Models can be catch all, or custom trained, the benefits of custom models is that it filters your results, so you&#039;re more able to accurately make what you want, I use an anime model for example, so I don&#039;t get any realistic, or 3D art.Next, you add LoRAs. It&#039;s an acronym, don&#039;t worry about it, the purpose of a Lora is to act as a weight on the scale, to get the results you want, there&#039;s Loras for everything, backgrounds, poses, outfits, details, characters, etc. There&#039;s even Loras to help prevent mistakes like extra fingers or keeping multiple people from blending together.Next, it&#039;s the Prompt, This is what you&#039;re telling the AI to make, you can use tags, or wax on like a poet about the stunningly beautiful woman you wish to see in her undergarments frigging herself. Hint: Use tags like a normal person. The same tags you see in Danbooru or any other Booru.Next, it&#039;s your negatives. You already told the AI to make what you want, this is you telling it what to avoid. using tags as well, most people just use this space to put stuff like&quot; 6th_finger, extra_legs, low_quality, low_res, etc. just telling the AI to not fuck up basically, but you can also put some thought into it to improve quality. For a personal example, I like lingerie, and I like me some stockings. I&#039;m a leg man. And the AI will make it, but it&#039;ll also bring in straps and a garter belt with it because it&#039;s usually part of a set, what if all you want is stockings? then you put: garter_straps, garter_belt, in your negatives and the AI will avoid them."

Depending on the skill of the slopper, you might be able to do miracles, or dogshit. But even beyond that, if you go commercial in any way shape or form you still run the risk of legal problems and C&amp;D, specially in this day and age where some artists can just use their sheep to attack and try to cancel you without any legal problems, and then your game has the reputation of being literally Hitler because you&#039;re putting some poor mentally ill artfag out of a patreon job and no one wants anything to do with it. Which might be overblown, but if the OG devs where concerned over Cease and Desist legal letters, this is a legitimate concern. Which means the artstyle will most likely be pic related, standard issue shinny AI art.Numbah two: You see that pregnant belly? that&#039;s the only one you can get reliably at the moment. 9 month old Xbox HUEG. If you want something smaller (Or pregnancy stages like some anons in the thread wanted) then you need to trick the AI, there&#039;s a pregnancy lora slider out there that ideally would give you different sized bellies, but in anime artstyle, all that does is make a smaller belly that still looks like a giant breast., so instead of a smaller stage of pregnancy you get a bigger third boob.You can trick some models into making a smaller belly, but that&#039;s not reliable in any way shape or form, I have done a few of these, and it takes time and effort trying to magic that into happening. More often than not you end up with messed up anatomy or poses, and therefor would only be suitable for a single image or two, unlike a set of sprites."

Like we can always resort back to photo-shopping different sizes again, but that was a massive painstaking amount of work. Or maybe use that img2img option if feasible to keep some kind of consistency between the sprite variants.&gt;&gt;8523804Like honestly, that is a damn really well done early preggo belly. But the reproducibility chance is so far off the scale it&#039;s not funny...&gt;&gt;8523808That is what we were discussing too. Surely don&#039; t want to look like a koikatsu or HoneyCome clone, what those &quot;inspired by&quot; character studio/creator games like Passion Eye are already doing too.Personally I think the art style from Artificial Academy 2 would be a nice base if mixed up a bit with the art style from Senran Kagura/Evenicle, for example to let the character skin color shading pop a bit more instead of the flat shading AA2 had."

Like, it&#039;ll legit just ignore the image and do it&#039;s own thing.More than likely sources would have to be from real life images of pregnant women, because there&#039;s no game out there with good preggo art, or you could just rip off that and move on with your day, which means you cannot keep denoise down to copy as faithfully as possible because you would be swapping from realistic into anime styles. And that could fuck up the transfer easy.&gt;that is a damn really well done early preggo belly. But the reproducibility chance is so far off the scale it&#039;s not funny...Thank you, I am not kidding when I say it took me like 40 images to get this single good result, the rest were either the XBOX HUEG pregnancies, or weird anatomy accidents, like an extra arm poking out of her stomach like a baby xenomorph"

It&#039;s possible to change his npcID to one of those, enable 100% preg chance cheat and knock her up that way (she&#039;d have to initiate, so it&#039;s not rape and male MC will be recorded in her sex history). She&#039;ll fall through the landscape when trying to give birth though (no animation again? If so, giving her a suitable npcID could fix that), but I didn&#039;t bother to test it. Adventuring with a waifu is at least one step closer to Rune Factory, but still very far from salvageable. I&#039;ll wait until the demo has something more going between them, since she&#039;s obviously the best girl functionality-wise. Anebaba looks better though, although not impregnable either. The dev&#039;s priorities are clearly very, very far from what I&#039;d like, going by the current wholesome:degeneracy ratio.One last question: does the DLC add anything substantial besides pedoshit? I added it and the already shitty female population got half-replaced with these worthless little shits. Considering hacking the demo some more to spawn female NPCs only, if at all possible, to compensate for it, but it better be worth the trouble or I&#039;ll simply delete the DLC if not the whole thing until better times."

Basically just a harem VN where each girl&#039;s route ends in you impregnating them, and you need to reach as many impregnations as possible before the timer runs out. You could have complex fertility mechanics, but nothing much past that.&gt;game lets you impregnate the women forever, but the babies just get offscreenedI feel like this is just a worse version of the first one&gt;game lets the child grow and get impregnated later onThese types of games work well but they require some way to get rid of the old women. In BOTN you can rid of breeders you don&#039;t want anymore, while non-porn games that have this usually have some kind of age mechanic to forcibly prune the old generations over time. Necessarily that means no MC, since they&#039;ll also age out over time&gt;the children grow and get used for something else over time, like soldiers in a strategy gameIn this the impregnation&#039;s basically just set dressing for unit buildings"

We can replace 3 arbitrary npcIDs and 3 more directly following one of them, so 6 total (1+1+4). Picrel is how to make the game spawn females only (and some other cheats). npcID is what you give to the /npc command, look up the list on the internet if you want other replacements.Note that you&#039;ll want some drops from male characters, so keep a backup of the DLL for that case; changing MakePatrol npcID (bookmarked on the picrel) to the one you want to farm for drops should make your life easier if you don&#039;t want to simply /get yourself that item."
