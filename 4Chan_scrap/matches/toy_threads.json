Simple as.&gt;if playmates can&#039;t claim ownership to their designs (until later, when they could)Now this is where it gets tricky, and the following is conjecture, and I&#039;ve said this theory before.I don&#039;t believe Playmates actually own the designs. I believe (and this is based on the fact that Super7 could make them in the first place) that the designs are owned by Varner Studios, who designed the original toys for Playmates. I believe that Super7 approached Varner for the rights to make the figures based on their designs.Now how can Playmates stop Super7 from making them if they don&#039;t own the designs? Master license. I guarantee that written into the contract is a clause where no other licensed company can compete with products that Playmates are releasing. Now do the Super7 Ultimates compete with the Playmates reissues in our eyes? Hell no. But to a court, I bet the similarity in the designs, even if they are aimed at a different market, would be enough to be considered a breach of contract.All conjecture, but this makes the most sense.&gt;It&#039;s been said pretty clearly Viacom owns all of it.That&#039;s not how it works for the molds. Paramount/Viacom owns the Intellectual Property rights for TMNT. That doesn&#039;t mean they own the actual molds. Playmates own the molds they made to produce figures. NECA owns their own molds. And Super7 own their molds. If those companies lost the license, they wouldn&#039;t be able to make figures with the molds, but the actual molds are still their property that they own, and they could choose to sell them to another company that now has the license to make figures, or melt down the steel into a paperweight if they wanted."

It seems like Varner did retain some level of ownership of their designs, which is why they are allowed to sell prints and books featuring their concept art on their website. There is also the issue that many of Varner&#039;s designs were used for non-Playmates merchandise, which was the loophole we thought would allow Super7 to continue the Ultimates designs. These two things are what leads me to believe that the reason that Super7 never needed permission to make the Playmates designs was because Playmates do not own the designs at all."

She has this large collar you have to deal with, and it&#039;s hard to integrate her shoulders into her torso without leaving this unwanted ridge on top of them as if she&#039;s wearing a really thick shawl.The other major issue is that the toon figures are simply not to scale. Both neca and S7 ran into an issue when they realized the turtles are LITTLE guys, almost all the other characters are much taller than them, so.... you start out &quot;this is a good scale&quot; then &quot;shit, we can&#039;t make everyone else that big&quot; so a lot of the toon figures are undersized.. and for April they tried to split the dif by having her be shorter (so she&#039;s not Shredder&#039;s height), but with a bigger head. but it didn&#039;t work. So then they tried to redo her, with a better head sculpt, and redid her upper torso and neck only, to make her taller.. but that also didn&#039;t fucking work, because now it&#039;s disproportionate. you had to redo the whole figure from scratch."
