This is a Pony model, so prompting is very different. Illustrious/Noob models are just better overall then Pony models, IMHO. However, AnimeBoys was trained on a lot of character data, and will default to good male ass and bulge, which is something female trained (read: practically all) models make feminine.Posted picture had following prompts for bulge: see-through bodysuit, covered pubic hair, covered body hair, covered testicles,"

They are not widely adopted because they don&#039;t work well or add anything useful. More does not necessarily equal better when it comes to this homebrew coding we have to deal with.Comfy is better at those 5sec gif generations people like. If you want to make those, then yes, start learning. Comfy is also better at using multiple models to work together on the same picture generation. But that is more of a niche thing that, again, is not widely adopted, especially for anime porn.Remember that A.I chat bots (like CoPilot and Grok) can help read GitHub instructions for you, and help walk you through what everything does. Not perfect, but it can help."

        "text": "&gt;&gt;3078865So the opening post of the thread has a lot of links to get you started. Try the two online generators, they let you play around for free with registration. You can also browse what other people are posting, as it will have the information (metadata) they used to generate it. https://civitai.com/user/gtgiygushttps://civitai.com/user/YaoiBoyhttps://civitai.com/user/cg210sdhttps://civitai.com/user/Kairen92For homebrew stuff, try looking at https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/wiki/index/ . Keep in mind you need a reasonably powerful PC in order to get it working. I have a 4060Ti with 16 gigs of vram, which is enough to run Stable Diffusion XL at full speed, which that particular barfly picture was made. You can make it work with 8 or 6 vram, but keep in mind you really should have a Nvidia card of some sort.If you run into specific questions, feel free to post them here. But it is very difficult to hand hold over 4chan threads, so give the links a shot first.Other than that, practice practice practice, and copy copy copy (what other people are doing). You will start to understand how it all comes together, but it takes time and effort."

It usually only needs 10–20 solid reference pics (ideally solo).

You can even add your own sperate prompt (and negative prompt!) to help clean up the area getting detailed.Chances are, if you find a really well done, highly detailed AI generated picture, it will have been run through multiple rounds of Hires.Fix and 4-6 different ADetailer detections/inpainting.

One lora that needs 220 MiBStarting resolution of 1024*1024 with 50 steps using &quot;DDPM&quot; Sampling method and &quot;SGM Uniform&quot; Schedule type.Hires.fix at 35 steps with 0.4 Denoising strength, upscaled by 1.5* = 1536*1536 pixels 2 Adetailer models: &quot;Anzhc Face segmant v2&quot; and &quot;CockandBallYolo8x&quot;.First generation @ 50 steps takes 24 sec.

        "text": "&gt;&gt;3079420Again, for any better advice you will have to provide more info. Screen shot of your UI would be helpful if you are really confused. I can say you are probably using an SDXL checkpoint. Try setting your starting resolution (Width and Height boxes) to 1024*1024 (or some combination thereof, like 864 * 1152 for portrait). Then, bring your Upscale percentage (&quot;Upscale by&quot; box) DOWN some. Upscale needs a lot more processing power than the original gen, and will slow you down if you are upscaling unnecessarily.The websites will always be faster because they have banks of GPUs to draw from. Again, keep trying to learn how to set it up yourself before giving money away. But hey, it&#039;s your life, not mine, do what you want."
