        "text": "&gt;&gt;95947885the MDC system was implemented from robotech, which was about mechs the size of small buildings changing into space fighters. that MDC makes sense. a machine gun wont do shit to a veritech. well maybe a lot of gatlings would, but that complicates the robotech setting. and sure, its a large mech so its gun will kill a person. thats why putting THAT much armor and gun power behind a small person in coalition armor disrupts the world too much for me. Id prefer it if the armors and DBs who had MDC stats were just REALLY REALLY tough, think of a Killer Croc from Batman type. youre not putting him down without a lot of hits or bullets. the atlantean horrors and warriors are more along the teir of ironman. only rockets, lasers, and hard impacts can damage them. GMs discretion. but MDC instakilling people and only nicking the smaller DBs who are supposed to be fleshy but tough, didnt sit well with me. they should be more balanced. I like it when the lasers and plasma are just 10X as strong as standard weapons, it also makes the DBs 10X as resiliant as a person, which is ridiculous but manageable. so to bring it back to robotech, war machines and demons (giant sized) are literally MDC. just my idea back then&gt;&gt;95947900robots are cool. MDC vehicles, borgs and mechs should have tougher stats than a plasticman armor or a juicers armor. I just dont see them worthy of getting 100X the defense, its imbalanced to me. looking back at the first edition, the munchkinism was baked into Rifts from day 1 imo. kevin wanted to up the ante but went too far"

Juggernaut is a better example.nah I like that. DBs being mini-supermen who can punch through vehicles, and tear your body into pieces with a light jab is too much. and youre not going to shoot down Killer Croc without using a lot of bullets. even then he&#039;ll probably survive it. being immune to small arms makes everyone juggernaut, exactly. thats not fun. even wormy DBs are MDC, and then it turns into a joke. and I dont know, falls and impacts are different... as even a tank, robot or a mech would break under the right amount of fall damage. show me a tank that can survive a mountain toss. many cant even survive a mine. an SDC mine or a bazooka. the damage scales dont work in absolutes, only in a bizarre logic kind of way that makes things obscenely overpowered. because MDC armor doesnt mean invincibility, it means that this thing it has futuristic plating/laser resistance coating/tough demon skin for a giant. but a smaller DB doesnt have THAT thick of a skin to justify it. and there is NO WAY the coalition forces could control or sustain that kind of population in the slums. no one could. its ridiculous. these guys would be the hulk, tearing up cars and punching down buildings with their MDC strength. no one could do shit. they would be breaking coalition guys necks resisting arrest left and right. the 100X is overkill for me. it was originally intended for giant mechs like in robotech, and that scale works better for me."

        "text": "&gt;&gt;95950343That bugs me too. Everybody in game has to walk into bars and inns with full glitter boy armor, or covered head to toe with helmet, chest plate and limbs covered. Imagine if everybody has to be like that just to survive. They couldn&#039;t on their best day. A midget DB could punch through you even if you lasted ten rounds getting hits on him. Towns people couldn&#039;t even exist from minor threats , and the town would be a smoldering mess from any shootout. When you look at character art or flavor art in the books, juicers are barely armored. Techo wizards are wearing vests only. Mind Melters are whatever. The scholar is super regular. The city rat is normal cyberpunk. A lot of people in the game tended to look like they&#039;re wearing vests or nothing, and that&#039;s it. Also, when do you take them off? You can&#039;t convince a PC to do it. The world is instakill city if you remove it. Plus, they have a unique system for SDC and HP, but you will never use it. They let you learn medical skills which would work for explosions, shrapnel, and bullet injuries. But with MDC? Pew pew pew, you&#039;re vaporized or toast. No need for anything. It zapped all of your SDC regardless. You could roll a two damage with a laser tag pistol and you&#039;re done for good. And how do vibro blades work? Imagine it hitting your body, anywhere and now you&#039;re dead. Some guy hits your calf while he&#039;s sprawled on the ground. Flesh wound? Nope, that&#039;s armor piercing vibro stuff, so you&#039;re just dead, kthanx . MDC is a cool concept but I leave it to big creatures and war machines. I&#039;m mor comfortable with SDC weapons still having a place, while not being the top of the food chain. A little more balance goes a long ways to taming the OP munchkins"

I dont see how an MDC powered DB would have any problem with mere doggy soldiers and deadboys getting flailed around while their weapons do minimal damage. the DBs can wear armor too, which is imbalanced as hell too. any uprising would be an end to their burbs shit, and the people who live there wouldnt survive even if the Coalition did. imagine your beefed up, 30 strength steroid built pitbull dogboy punching and pummeling the shit out of a regular DB who has MDC strength, only for him to go &#039;heh, thats cute little doggy but my skin is magic or whatever&#039; and then turns his face into mist. I never thought the MDC rules worked outside of major bosses like gods or the 4 horsemen, mecha, and vehicles. the giant furry beetle too, he deserves an MDC armor lol."

I think Marvel did this too in the Captain America movies where the serum gets out and theres some issue with how they treat super terrorists lol. most people would want nothing to do with ugly monsters who literally can walk through your best like they were Superman. even having super reflexes, scent abilities, psionics and magic capabilities that will outclass some of your top OCCs. DBs are some bullshit and I prefer it tamer, with the issue being more simple in that theyre not Kryptonian level threats, but more like the Universal Monsters who are scary and dangerous, in some cases big bad asses, but mostly manageable. and some who are the good ones, and are misunderstood. its gives the story more nuance when everybody is on a closer level"

They pump in chemicals to make them horny all the time &amp; they discourage coed comingling (which just makes them more likely to &quot;break the rules&quot; &amp; hook up&quot;. After training you might get selected to be breeding stock, again a large gender slant with a few dudes &amp; a ton of women. There you were pseudo forced to copulate &amp; if you were low fertility (which considering every one was on zinc &amp; fertility drugs the baseline was high) you got booted. This sounds kinda bad but they kept you safe &amp; taken care of, better than most citizens. Mothers were treated really well, especially those that birthed psychics. Even after you exited that program you could still participate in other ways. My guy was required to fuck or donate a sperm sample all time when not in the field.

They would likely not bother with a breeding camp to create more psychics when they already make psychic furries tailored to their needs and psystalkers already integrated into their military combat structure. They have unique psychic training programs but those are to make use of people showing psychic potential already to make use of them either to put them on the front lines or to make them secret police.

Damage output is generally agreed to be halved and turned to MDC. Further, your gear stays SDC unless it was magical, your supernatural strength goes from AR bypassing to following the Rifts table. Impervious to damage powers get changed as well to no longer just nullify damage. A big thing is that all your skills are now shit.When converting from modern earth to rifts earth all your skills do not change. American and English are too different languages now along with all earth languages. Your me animal and piloting skills are all for things that was 200 years ago and either don&#039;t work or you now have a foreign/alien tech penalty to operate.So being a superhero conversion in Rifts is not broken.

The Palladium rules slowly break themselves the more new books get released. I think nobody checks Siembieda so his power creeping goes on without impunity. All sorts of rules even for SDC get refined. Of course super heroes are supposed to be tough, and Rifts is lethal to all living beings and then some. Palladium books actually ran together pretty smoothly before Rifts, which is ironic since Rifts is supposed to be like a nexus point for all of them where they can literally meet. Super heroes could show up in a fantasy setting. You could put your Ninja or Super Spy into an After the Bomb setting. Ninja Turtles blend into Beyond the Supernatural pretty easily too. Somehow Rifts tangled it all up. Best setting, most difficult conversions. I guess that&#039;s why we had to buy those giants books, which even imply do whatever because making sense if it off the rip gets convoluted."

Rifts however is not that fatal unless you are a rain dead dnd player and your GM cant explain what defensive moves are. On paper it seems easy to die and the rules from all the books seems like it must be a cluster fuck but risk management comes natural and the golden rule.Also, you don&#039;t play rules if they aren&#039;t in the book you&#039;re in.each world book is balanced for within itself. Don&#039;t be a dick, I see to many players roll some lemurian when the campaign is in a desert."

And it&#039;s one of the reasons Prometheans are so secretive3rd, they moved their entire homeworld out of phase or into the Astral or some kind of dimensional pocket as a way to hide.4th, they tend towards good alignments, but they have a bit of a fearful reputation, people think of them as evil boogeyman, despite their good hearts5th, they have recovered from their war, &amp; they have been moving in the shadows to gather their old power now they are moving out in force to expandNo clue as to a name for them so I&#039;m open to suggestions.

I think it would be nice if they were to know phase tech, so they&#039;d have stuff relating to that, weapons, armor, &quot;ghost&quot; ships etc. I want to maybe make a &quot;Phase Knight&quot; OCC that&#039;s a fighting man with phase powers. I want them to have a psi/phase blade that passes through any &amp; all material barriers or phase powers to cut into MDC/SDC but will hit forcefields like normal. Like Shardblades from Way of Kings. Current tech based Phase Swords dont actually do that are kind of a mess.But they&#039;re also natural spellcasters too so I&#039;m not sure where to take that item/tech wise other than just having technowizards which is kinda lame. Maybe make knock off Diabolist Wards that are called &quot;magic circuits&quot; that do similar things but treated more technological than mystical. No sacrificing doves to make a &quot;Circuit&quot; of Force Other than that, any technology that hides them or is defensive in nature is going to be their specialty. And that&#039;s just their tech/powers. Next I gotta figure out what their society is like. What kind of people are they that lost a war, &amp; became misunderstood boogeymen? The &quot;Chrome Eyed Demons&quot; that snatch up kids that misbehave or don&#039;t each , or whatever. They aren&#039;t quite able to have a full on war with any of the big powers anymore, but their also tired of hiding.Do the have an Emperor? a King? a Republic or Democracy? Are they fractious? What do they think of the other races? Do they have dimensional tech? Etc.A whole lot of stuff to consider because they&#039;re so advanced I can&#039;t just shelve it or treat them like a StarWars/StarTrek alien &amp; paint them with a broad brush"

And it keeps you in there for 5 or so rounds and if you do resist it you are held for 2d6 rounds. Look at the typical expected use of the spell: Cast on ground and enemies walk on it and get stuck. This means that they cant get stuck but it also means that they cant turn around, if they are pushed over or trip or try to dive and touch the ground they are pinned and effectively frozen fast in place. If they have a loose shoulder strap or barrel of a rifle graze the ground that weapon is going to become near impossible to fire effectively and they are stuck like that for several rounds. He&#039;ll, the community is still debating if autododge can work while stuck on the carpet because you can duck easily once but of your hand or knee is touches the ground then you cant move at all now.I&#039;ll give numbers to explain this. If you stick someone for two minutes and can shoot them unopposed for four actions a round with a peewee pistol that does 2d6 that will work out to an average of 112 MD they have no choice but to suck up."

        "text": "&gt;&gt;96036903To get into more intricate scenarios keep in mind that to get stuck on the carpet of adhesion it just says you need to touch it. Any physical contact works, not just a firm press. If you say, to be very specific, are fighting two winged demons that they are so large you can only cast on one limb you can cast it on one of their wings you know will contact the demon standing next to him. At worst the demon wing sticks to itself when retracted and he cannot fly but at best it gets stuck to another demon and are stuck together as they try to pry themselves free and thus are out of the fight. You can cast it on weapons to keep them stuck in holsters or grenades they cant pull pins out of or throw away, you can cast them on the hands of a really big ally who can punch an enemy and then use him like a club or shield without even having to grapple them, and so on. A key point here is that the spell also works on inanimate objects on robots who typically don&#039;t have any saves against magic.There is also utility here like using it to grip on to vehicles like trains or the underside of cars. You can cast it on smooth doors to allow a super strong team mate grip to force the door open. Its a very useful spell!"

In the big book I have, there was NOTHING like this, nor in any of the PDFs I was able to source. They were all basically races without R.C.Cs or O.C.Cs. I made some stuff but everything I made was either way too buff or like way underwhelming. That, I&#039;ll take it on the chin as user error, but I was hoping to find something that&#039;s just like what you&#039;ve posted! So I want to know WHERE, what source is this from and if there are other books like it? I loved how classes were described in the liberty you had in PalFan2e but as a mediocre at best GM, it&#039;s all a little daunting with THAT much prep work required to run a simple goblin."

The Blue Flame is an Elemental force that has no apparent alignment or intrinsic intelligence. You are right about the warlock spells though as it says that the ones that can be learned are included in the list of invocations at higher levels than on the elemental warlock spell lists."

Keep in mind that for the Leyline Walker they are supposed to have the quest to learn as much magic spells as possible if only for an academic interest. Any leyline walker already should have the reason to learn a spell because they want to know it because they currently don&#039;t know it. I think there are D&amp;D brained people out there who think that it must be balanced, not knowing that spells by and large are not-offensive with niche uses, and that acquiring spells is usually done as rewards and exchanges through a story: ie, cloud magic is unattainable to non-native american shamans or golden hawk people for no other reason than that they see cloud magic as a cultural aspect. If you did something heroic to save a tribe of Natives than being taught a cloud magic spell would now be a suitable reward."

        "text": "&gt;&gt;96104340I think beauty should be able to replace charisma in the short term, but if your character is lacking in personality and force of will, as charisma is standardly described as, then the character&#039;s bargaining power quickly wanes and basically has the same results as dealing with a fast-talking con man for too long: they&#039;re disgusting and manipulative. Their target will disengage after getting sex without repaying them in any way, or manipulate them in turn such that the beautiful character is now advancing their own goals instead. In mechanical terms, something like re-rolling on a reaction table with the difference between the comeliness and charisma acting as a penalty when using purely looks for any persuasion attempts longer than a short conversation or one-off meeting would be how I&#039;d handle it starting out, and see how it shakes out."

If the wielder is killed the book purges itself of all by its basic spells and teleports to a random plane of existence.The book has a spirit guide tied to it, with no phyical presence except to the wielder. If the book is separated from the wielder by death she looses all memories except for her role as the books curator.It has infinte pages, but weighs no more than a normal spellbook.This spellbook is magically locked and waterproof.The cost of copying spells into this is halvedMagic Battery.The staff has 30 charges for the following properties.It regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 20, the staff regains 1d4 charges.Spell Absorption.While holding the book, you have advantage on saving throws against spells. In addition, you can use your reaction when another creature casts a spell that targets only you.

The spell is scribed automatically into the tomeSpells.While holding the book, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast any of the spells added to the book, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability.

The basic premise is that the protagonist wakes up in the universe of a video game, but the version is thoroughly modded for sex stuff. (Inspired by I Reincarnated Into A Game Filled With Mods.) However, I don&#039;t really play Skyrim SexLabs or games like it, so I don&#039;t know all the tropes. This is my outline about what&#039;s &quot;different&quot;, gender/sexwise, from our world:- Women are as capable of fighting and doing other stuff as men (same HP bar, etc).- The overwhelming majority of births are female (males are just guys the modders didn&#039;t get rid of yet, so it&#039;s like 1:15-30 m:f ratio). This is just the way it is.- All women are hot. Big diversity of female bodies, from dicksucking height to using your head as a titshelf height, Hyper to flat, rainbow colored harem even though you&#039;re on a fairly small island (like half the size of ireland), etc.- STDs literally do not exist. Unless you count spells, which you learn by fucking the teacher now instead of previous ways of transfer. (Base game has ~5 spells you can learn, more Zelda than Skyrim.)- Men have complete control of fertility; if they want to knock a woman up after nutting in her, she becomes pregnant, if they don&#039;t, she doesn&#039;t.- Women come easily and lots, including from blowjobs (technically this isn&#039;t realistic in sex games in my experience, but, it gets my dick hard so he installed the Blowjob Orgasm mod or smth)- Women will fuck really easily. No incest taboo, or bio-issues from consanguinity of the first degree, etc.- People think about public sex the way we think about holding hands in public.- Polygamy is totally normal and it&#039;s normal for the man not to bother asking his existing wives&#039; their opinion on his new wife.Anything I&#039;m missing?"

I&#039;ve got a more plot-driven backstory for how they got together, but it&#039;s not what I&#039;m running at the moment. That said, Witch is coming to terms with her life-cycle as a witch (effectively a type of fey) and what it means for her, and Warlock is struggling with his past as a formerly pretty evil person, working for a cruel and childish king he and Witch deposed during their first adventure together.Their latest escapade is almost finished, but might not be ready to post before this thread finishes because I&#039;ve been struggling to focus on it. Even so, here&#039;s the finished ref commission I got from a friend, for those who were interested.Mwah!"

In which a lot of lewd and fetish settings and games here are primarily Western Anglo Euro themed and and inspired.

That and any Muslim will violently threaten your life over it.Unless, are some of you actually daring and bold enough to make such sexualized material about Arabia and Muslim settings?

It&#039;d also completely gloss over a lot of sexual themes that are central to western frame of mind. For example an arab lewd rpg would probably use women more like tokens than full NPCs and you&#039;d spend more time taking them from their fathers or husbands than charming them, and just be more overall focused on the player displaying masculinity and power than the females being sexy or slutty."

        "text": "Update to Lewdyria, the Lewd Attack Lore book. It is now 315 pages long, and filled with enough degeneracy to make me question whether it&#039;s entirely wise to allow me outside. The old Dwarven Delving table of 20 unique scenarios has been replaced with a more broad table of 216 thematically similar scenarios. They should still be unique enough to not feel like madlibs. Absolutely unchecked for balance, your character can take it though. Added hanger tentacles which is heavily flavored around asphyxiation, so skip it if you don&#039;t like.Otherwise, yeah. May add more if the mood strikes me, or if people come up with some interesting enough stuff to add. Otherwise potentially the last update. LA is an interesting system with potential produced by its mechanics to make it my personal fave. I wish it were less complex or more streamlined in some regards though. May work on an alt ruleset. As always, feedback appreciated, can&#039;t guarantee I&#039;ll see it, but I lurk when I am able.Added: Social and Cultural Affairs section, which adds some explanations and justifications for things. Optional Alternate Rules for binding and addiction, ignore at your leisure. Barebones Oracle with dynamic test difficulty and playing-card based fetish table. Dwarven Warrens missions/quests/jobs table. Pictures (no nudity) for playable races. A much larger scenario table for moving between Warrens. Stat tables and encounter scenarios for Kobold Tyrants, as well as Hanger and Sinkhole tentacles.Changed: Spell checking.Removed: Outdated Delving table.File is pixel drain hT4wiS6X"
