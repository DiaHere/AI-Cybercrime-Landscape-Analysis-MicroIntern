What have you done!?”Deep within the heart of your garden, a group of chittering little creatures, designed to clear the leaf liter and cull the weeds with their little mouths, have absolutely ruined the hedges! The long neck grubblies look up at you without any instinct for fear or self preservation, no knowledge, no wisdom. Why would that? That is not their purpose. Your hands can wrap around them easily, and you hold one close.“Oh no! How did you get into that? You naughty, silly little thing. I need to fix this. The garden must be perfect...”You can&#039;t have the little ones ruining your carefully designed and curated hedges. They are the frame for your masterwork, and you can&#039;t have your little ones creating a mess. They already excrete their waste in little holes, breed away from sight, and in all other ways are out of the way. They&#039;ve just gotten too greedy with the hedges. But you can&#039;t just get rid of them; else the leaf litter will pile up. Hmm...&gt;Adjust their anatomy so they can&#039;t eat from the hedges&gt;Change their diet to something else&gt;Punish this one and hope the rest learn a lesson"

You place the creature inside, closing your eyes, the machine feeling inside of you for what you wish. You imagine, and it becomes so, tissues and life-force knitting themselves into a new pattern. Fundamentally changed at the core of its being, the little lesser drone will become more useful now. As an Aristocrat, you are the only kind among your society who can interface with the life machines, the only one who can change the forms fundamental. You make sure the new creature&#039;s biology is genetically prioritized, so they will breed true, and soon enough your mutation will spread throughout all of the little-leaf-litter eaters!You place it back outside and see the results of your work. It&#039;s altered anatomy keeps its head low to the ground, unable to look up for predators or to eat from your hedges, with the excess tissue being made into great big ears to funnel the scent of fallen leaves into its mouth-nostril; happily it gobbles them up, running here and there, while leaving your hedges untouched.&quot;Perfect! Lovely, lovely!&quot;Now, with your garden in order again, you can return to the masterwork, enough even to impress your Liege-Lord, Ully&#039;Andule..."

Having only just recently been given the Hegemonic medallion and poised to take over the Hegemony from your father, your training and schedule has been accelerated. Still, you like to spend some time honing your skills.&quot;Threes, set up a combat sim. You have a large robot?&quot;&quot;Yes, my liege. Though I will add, if you used a knife like a normal Supreme Candidate in training, we wouldn&#039;t have to replace them after you bash them apart.&quot;&quot;Sassy today, huh? Three opponents.&quot;You undress and take up your large pole of stabilized lead. It&#039;s heavy and extremely strong; not toxic enough to cause any harm in all but the most sensitive organisms. It is by no means a traditional weapon, but it is a fearsome one. You never much liked Knife-fighting, little knife points not befitting an Alpha-Male of your strength and stature.The hologram training room is set up; with three robots coming forward. Two small ones, representing normal opponents like Jaxtians or Leeray, and a large bodied one with additional limb capacity, representing larger and stronger opponents for wrestling or other combat sports; like Proo or Alpha males or Vetuckers, or even female Leeray, which the AI seems to be prioritizing to keep this training session most &quot;realistic&quot;.Spinning your pole, you think strategy.

You spin your pole around, eager to prove yourself. The two smaller opponents approach first; false knives in hand. You raise the far end of your pole and jab at them, keeping them back. It has no point, but nobody wants to be on the end of your fearsome rod- except maybe a very excited female Jaxtian, har har!You just have to wait for one of the robots to slip up and fall for the oldest trick in the book; trying to grab the end of the pole..."

It surrenders pathetically, unable to hold onto its weapon as you twist the pole in its chest cavity, causing its simulating lungs to collapse. You know its spine is mangled, real or not, and you&#039;re also sure that Threemind won&#039;t let you step on any shed robotic components scattered around the room from your roughhousing.You take the pole up with a swing and grip it tightly, tensing every muscle in your young and strong body as you await the final opponent; the large monster-like creature charging at you with claws outstretched.

It&#039;s just a matter of pride. Fighting multiple opponents at once can multiply it, and show great skill.

The sudden amount of information you&#039;re exposed to is huge; reports on every sector and industry, machine-state predictions giving you insight into future actions and their consequences, and probably worst of all; your own ideas and desires being put through the wringer of actually having to be made real and concrete. All you have to do is breathe something you think should be changed or improved and a hundred AI models and a thousand experts are already looking into it; simulations and possible cultural impacts served up to you with every perspective analyzed and focus-grouped into an actionable plan. It&#039;s scary.For yourself? You are inheriting the Hegemony from your Father, Avae Anak, which smooths over some aspects of the father-son cultural line of succession to a literal one. He spent his entire reign colonizing the former Hazaari star systems after their cleansing by Hass Takar; and building them up into a formidable empire. Every habitable world there has colonies and fresh cities built, space stations and long-distance industries built up in orbits, research bases, factories, nature preserves, and all the like as advanced and with the infrastructure of the core Hegemonic worlds. To an outsider, these systems would look like they were colonized at the same point in history to your core worlds; not underdeveloped at all; just a fresher coat of paint.https://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive/2024/6107725/While this has resulted in a huge amount of new livable habitats and created a massive population boom; its main impact has been economic."

Industry focused on meeting the demands of your Supreme Ruler and high administrators instead of capital, mindful of environmental impact, and eliminating as much waste as possible. While decent enough when only owning a single star cluster; you&#039;d think owning two star clusters would double it. But even your training in economics and industry and you couldn&#039;t predict its true impact. Not only do you have many more habitable planets, the new Hegemonic races fulfilling new consumer markets, and possible trade between the colonies and homeworlds; you also have the massive impact of the Reassembler technology, which has replaced almost all small-market consumer goods with very efficient forms of recycling. Every ship and colony has fabricators now; and with uplinking to the AI network mandatory to all they can be turned to whatever use you deem fit to better suite your goals.Your economy hasn&#039;t doubled with the new worlds and technology, it&#039;s more then tripled.While you still can&#039;t quite measure up to the raw unfettered, degenerate capitalism of the Consortium; your economic output has greatly exceeded both the Esaal and Aristocrats. Even goods they special in, like mineral processing or biological products respectively, you exceed with your own production. The quality of life and resource abundance for Hegemonic citizens has exceeded both nations, with only the Consortium slightly above it as an average; but this is only because of the huge gap between rich and poor in their hellscape of an economic system. All because of your father. He even made the first battleship; increasing your military&#039;s strength to surpass the Aristocrats and Consortium further, though you are still behind the Esaal in that regard.It appears your father&#039;s lifelong, thankless work has paid off. Due to his advanced aging, you have decided on your imperial robes. Black, for respect and honor for the dead and those who came before; but with a gray and yellow stripe, representing Cijan Anak and Avae Anak, your father. At least for the moment; three Anak men who are or were Supreme live at the same time, which is most fortuitous. Your robe represents this."

What Supreme Ruler doesn&#039;t want a blank check; to borrow a capitalist&#039;s term?Ultimately, you first decided to begin development of a Starsight Academy, a place to learn and study Starsight properly. Starsight is the “mystical” ability to see into hyperspace, a curious talent once thought only to be available for creatures born without or damaged vision that allows for navigation and piloting ships for Faster Then Light travel. The school is designed on a large asteroid instead of on a habitable planet; which makes it less defendable but much harder to find via Starsight, as well as making it more “neutral ground” then a Hegemonic core world. It has many facilities including hangars, space flight simulators, accelerators allowing for contained FTL experiments, living spaces, lecture halls, rooms for meditation and similar mental exercises, and more. On top of this, the entire facility is also equipped with a warp drive, though slower then a traditional ship, allowing it to be moved or bring the entire student body into hyperspace for their introduction to “seeing the stars” without shielding, which seemed to be the catalyst to unlock the talent for the very first Jaxtian Starseer, one Kimnan Oles.To this day, a white lanyard is the most rare color of all in the Hegemonic uniform; representing those specializing in this field. Despite its usefulness and connotations, Starsight has only been given a cursory exploration by Supreme Rulers of the past, given its unpopularity among citizens (given they have to be crippled to participate; though you can grow their eyes back easily now) and it&#039;s quasi-religious undertones, going against core beliefs of the Hegemony&#039;s culture. It is also underexplored due to it being so personal; with many Starseers have totally unique experiences that cannot be easily replicated or trained. However, given a few standouts, like one Radjo Berax, who was capable of Starsight while he possessed functioning eyes, it is clear there is much more to explore.”I see the space for climbing poles and excess storage rooms within this academy&#039;s design, but are these bird perches? Long straight hallway-style barracks in the Esaal design? What is this architecture, Threes?”“It is for the Urgi and Esaal students who may one day attend the Academy, your grace.””...Why would I ever allow our enemies to study at our most prestigious Academy, Threemind?!”"

You know that our rivals in space, the Esaal, Consortium, Aristocrats, the burgeoning Urgi state... be have fought with all of them, but also worked with all of them too. They are allies or enemies of convenience. However, we unique among them have developed Starsight independent of the space worms, who could very well be our greatest and most insidious foe. Many Supreme in the past have expressed concern over the rumored “Cyte” and the worms as being the true threat to the Hegemony over these temporary rivals. In any case, having the ability to teach other species in the Galaxy our methods of Starsight to lessen the worm&#039;s political strength could be an excellent bargaining chip for the future. This is why our approved design focused on the Academy itself as being the GALAXY&#039;S finest, not just the Hegemony.””Hmm... Perhaps you&#039;re right. In the same way the worms have a political stranglehold over Starsight, we could have a competition to their “monopoly”, and spread our political influence through something vital to all intergalactic trade, warfare, and diplomacy...”“Precisely.””In that case, I approve of these designs. But I don&#039;t expect to see any of those kinds of students any time soon...”As for the Migrators, the mysterious fourth race of the Hegemony. Discovered by the Jaxtians before the Vetuckers or Swall, these aquatic animals were only spared by Wrix Val the Unspeakable&#039;s purge due to being of low intelligence and more useful as Starsight navigators. Thought to be little more then uplifted animals, only during the reforms and racial integration of Hass Takar were they given more education and treatment as “citizens”, though most of them (the same ones still alive from first contact), don&#039;t really understand the concept of governments or work or pay or whatever else. Their numbers were always extremely small, and only started to grow after the acquisition of HBTP-OW1, as the Esaal named it, a cold-water habitable ocean planet loaned to the Hegemony by the Esaal within Esaal space."

I figured we&#039;d hit a wall with interlacing genetic material of organisms too different from us at some point; I suppose that&#039;s the “Maktana Magic” for you.”“There is an ongoing theory that the similarity between species in the galaxy near each other is no coincidence but based on convergent evolution, though the Migrators are still an exception. Anyways; these gene upgrades will alter their biology significantly from the cold-water evolution. Their lifespan will be reduced to about half, about 500 years, but given their previous lifestyle of being asleep for 99% of their lives anyway...””This will be an added benefit, and more effective time. I would hate to be asleep for almost my entire life myself; this is well worth it. Them actually being awake for a war fleet will more then make up for it.”In addition to the general advancement of the Migrator genome, meaning increases to their metabolism and ability to live in more aquatic environments; you also have the ability to add specific mutations to further adapt the species to your liking. After all, no expense will be spared on this project, the Threemind says, but reminds you that these changes will take some time to appear in the Migrator&#039;s gene pool and will not be able to be changed in the future, so choose wisely."

        "text": "From the primate genetic traits, the Migrators can be granted genes similar to the pre-Jaxtian common ancestor of Jaxtian races; the spidermonkey, whose genes determine the length and prehensile strength of the Jaxtian tail. Akule selected populations of Jaxtians with a high enough percentage of Spidermonkey DNA that they could fully support themselves with just their tail alone. In the Migrators, we can copy these patterns to increase the length and strength of Migrator tails, giving them improved swimming speed and mobility. While its influence on their Starsight abilities is unknown, hooking them up to the inside of a water-filled cockpit could allow for them to become regular pilots. Secondly, we could also copy over the Alpha-male polymorphic gene, allowing for some Migrators to become much larger and stronger then others, likely the males, leading to increased longevity but slower development for some migrators.From the herbivore traits of the Vetuckers; we can grant the Migrators either a mutation to consume plankton and completely change their current diet into that of a filter-feeding creature; able to support a much larger population with farming, or individual-specific skin patterns from the “Painted Faces” Vetucker genetic group; which would give the Migrators much more individuality and help with social identification. This could lead to a certain amount of tribalism among their kind, but this could be manipulated for our benefit.Finally, the Swall being partially aquatic, likely have traits most useful for the Migrators. Their possible mutations are the toxin adaptation; similar to the Swall acidic ink spit they can use for self defense. This would allow the Migrators to partially absorb certain common toxins in their home waters, especially tropical or warmer climates, to both protect themselves from predators and make their biology more adaptable. Finally, a similar gill-lung structure could make the Migrators able to survive outside of water by breathing air; though their weight will still crush their organs if left out of water for too long. Simply put, this would make them more amphibious.You may choose one choice for each Donor species in your voteJaxtian&gt;Spidermonkey Genes&gt;Selective GigantismVetucker&gt;Filter-Feeding Mutation&gt;Patterned CoatsSwall&gt;Toxin Adaptation&gt;Limited Amphibian"

All in all, the Migrators will be much different now. Beyond them being a bit sleeker and more adapted to warmer waters and more active lifestyles; a secondary effect of this mutation seems to be an enhanced development of the jaw and especially large fangs; probably used to crush shellfish or break through ice-flows. Strangely, this mutation doesn&#039;t seem to come from any of your meddling, and inherent to the Migrators when climes warm.Naturally, given their glacially slow rate of reproduction, it will take some time for these effects to fully manifest in the Migrator gene pool. Hopefully, a future Supreme can benefit from them as more full and active citizens, instead of curiosities.In the meanwhile, you contact Usis Nanonae, your colleague and fellow candidate for Supremacy, and ask him about his progress on his special project.

You can look at a beautiful Jaxtian woman under a red light, and never do you mistake her for an Esaal whore. If you take these fruits and cast them in blue light, and connect them together under a membrane, and give that membrane a skin like texture... and then it will look as the woman does. But at no point does your brain react to it as the woman does until it is indistinguishable or the image is so distorted you can&#039;t tell them apart- our minds cannot possibly hold every possible permutation of image possible we can see and react to. So how we can interpret it? Is it math? Is it the context? This curve is the same; they are both borne of organic molecules.

It creates an image on the screen exactly as it would appear in the real world; the same thing my eyes see. Yet my senses and my nerves feed information into my brain that becomes abstract. To this screen, the image generated of a Jaxtian woman, or landscape, or complex machinery; all of it is merely pixels and light patterns displayed with electronic precision. Yet it creates meaning- how can something you see or something you touch transfer to meaning and emotion effortlessly, wired from raw imput. How can you know what beauty is? Or fear? Or peace? What equation regulates it, what color-scale accents it? Where in the brain can it hide? I must know.””...Usis, you are my spymaster. I need your help. If you were Supreme, you could sit here all day and fret about with these pointless philosophical questions. But the situation with the Urgi requires more immediate concern. Do you understand? I will have none of this prattle during such a pivotal moment. The firing of random neurons in the body concern me very little!”“...Of course, your Majesty.” Usis sighed.

Being made up for many small and independent social groups; the Urgi have been a large part of the Galactic Underground, the loose multispecies organization of independent people, businesses, and groups that operate underneath the nose of the larger powers in space. Mostly known to the Hegemony as pirates who raided colonies; the Urgi&#039;s situation has changed as large swathes of territory became available for the taking. To the Hegemony&#039;s surprise, the Urgi are actually becoming a nation.Since your father&#039;s time, some things have changed. The Accord, a small collection of independent captains and people who valued meritocratic rule of law and tradition; has grown to a fully fledged faction in Urgi freespace. Your father&#039;s decision to let them live in the border zones between your empire, freespace, and the Esaal had a strong part in that; giving them breathing space and furthering ties between them and the Hegemony. The Redwings, made up of the Bloodwings and Darkwing mercenary groups combined, represent another strong faction. Finally the Gold-Dipped Feathers have renamed to the Goldwings and incorporated many independents into a strong merchant coalition. Only one of these three great factions will Rule.However, instead of a nuclear holocaust like the Hegemony; the Urgi are coming together democratically. They are going to vote on which group will reign Supreme; whichever faction gets the most votes, will win. The concept is ridiculous to you; but represents a massive opportunity for the Hegemony."

        "text": "The Urgi Council is made up of Sixteen seats. Some seats are held by representatives for large swathes of the Urgi&#039;s population; the Ice-Belt Mining Coalition or Nebula City&#039;s population wanting a voice in the proceedings. Other seats are held just by rich and powerful; famous captains known for adventure across the stars, or grand leaders of pirate fleets; and some seats are just held by religious and spiritual leaders; to which the Urgi also unfortunately still have not yet advanced beyond.”Threemind? Rundown the political situation. How can we manipulate the council?”“Each council member has interests. These are represented by the symbols above their heads. Each interest a council member has represents an equal chance to vote for that corresponding faction when it comes time for the election. Given the Urgi are socially undeveloped, they are using a one vote per council member, an inferior system rife with corruption.””So we can predict who they will vote for?”“Yes. Each council member will vote for one of their interests. For example, Council Member #6 is a pirate leader; an infamous pirate known as Whitewing. The albino Urgi only knows warfare as a trade, but only does it for money. We cannot fully predict how he will vote; but come election day he will vote either for whichever faction is the most militaristic and powerful militarily, or whichever is the most capitalistic and rich. Only one.””Break down the Interests.”“The first three interests are for the specific factions; the Accord, the Redwings, and the Goldwings. If a senate member votes for this interest, they will simply vote for the faction. Then it gets more complex. Militarists will vote for whatever faction is the most powerful, represented by the red bars by their faction designation letter on the council screen. Capitalists will vote for whichever faction is the richest and prosperous, represented by the green bars. Pacifists meanwhile are the opposite of militarists and will vote for whichever faction is the least militarized, and has the least number of weapons. Populists represent the common people; often minors or galley-slaves aboard ships, and will vote for the least capitalistic, or poorest faction with the least green bars. Finally, Isolationists by and large want to return to how things were before with little central authority and stay out of the way of other large powers in space, and will vote for whichever faction is both the least militarized and capitalistic or has the least bars total, and the Supremacists are the opposite, simply voting for whichever faction is the most powerful overall. Be warned, not all interests as so simple. Isolationists will very likely react poorly to overt support by outside powers in the Council&#039;s decision.””Heh... that must mean me.”"

As birds, with hollow bones and coming from low gravity worlds, they are very risk averse. They have none of the honor culture or great brave dueling culture we do. As such, it is well understood that this election will be no different, and not exactly fair and transparent. Each faction, and even individuals is vying for power here. They will do anything to win the vote and become the ruling voice in the new Urgi state; whichever faction wins will gain the political power and consent of the masses, and will likely influence which greater power in space the Urgi ally themselves with. This is a massive moment for them... and a huge opportunity for us. Your father began our relationship with the Accord on a strong foot. Imagine the alliance we could forge with them if they became the dominant faction in Urgi space.””Understood. Contact the spymasters, and collect information on the Council. Let&#039;s see what kind of chaos I can cause...”The Redwings are highly militarized and already associated with the Esaal. Their “boiling guns” are of interest to the Esaal; and you know any weapon that interests those warmongers must be extremely worthwhile. They are highly likely to join with their neighboring Esaal before the more decadent and soft Hegemony. The Goldwings on the other hand are extremely mercantile, and will plunge the Urgi into centuries of capitalist degeneration; going hand-in-hand with the Consortium&#039;s aims. They&#039;ve already adopted the Consortium Credit, and each transaction they make is only going to increase the value of their currecny even more. Even culturally, they will likely take more towards the slave-owning and extravagant displays of wealth ways of the Aristocrats then your own culture.The Urgi as a race and a people are going to become a major player in space. It is inevitable; gaining ownership of a large war-torn region of space with their unique technological history and position as experienced spacers with connections all over the underground mean they are already familiar with many of the perils and opportunities in space. This is nothing like the Hegemony putting out its first measly Star-Dynamo sub-light ships to explore your own solar system. This will be a fully fledged space-fairing empire now in its birthing stages. And you have the opportunity to influence it.The Accord must win."

While the mystery dudes are more important, we can guess what the mystery bars are with like four possible arrangement.Possibility #1REDWING MYSTERY BAR: REDGOLDWING MYSTERY BAR: REDThis would result in RW having 4R/1G and GW having 2R/4G This means RW would win over the Militarists and Populists, GW wins over the Pacifists, Capitalists and Supremacists and Accord wins over the Isolationists.Granted, this doesn&#039;t account for thoes who will just vote for their own faction Possibility #2REDWING MYSTERY BAR: GREENGOLDWING MYSTERY BAR: GREENThis leaves RW with 3R/2G and GW with 1R/5G. RW would win over the Militarists, GW wins over the Capitalists/Supremacists/Pacifists, Accord wins over the Isolationists and the Populists would be tied between Accord and Redwing.Possibility #3REDWING MYSTERY BAR: REDGOLDWING MYSTERY BAR: GREEN4R/1G for RW. 1R/5G for GW. RW would win over the Militarists and Populists, GW would win over the Pacifists/Capitalists/Supremacists, Accord would win over the Isolationists.POSSIBILITY #4REDWING MYSTERY BAR: GREENGOLDWING MYSTERY BAR: RED3/2 for RW, 2/4 for GW. RW could win over the Militarists, GW could win over the Capitalists/Supremacists, Accord could win over the Isolationists. The pacifists would be split between Accord and Goldwing, Populists would be split between the RW and the AccordWe need more information on what bars we exactly have but out of the current arrangement, I think one of the better actions we can do besides information is to spread either the Populist or Pacifists factions while denouncing Militarists. Depends on which possibility wins.I do hope it&#039;s POSSIBILITY #4 since that might give us more to work with via the PACIFISTS and POPULISTS being possibly split between two factions."

Not much contact or information about them has filtered out, as the Esaal discovered them when they were technologically underdeveloped and used them for physical labor. The Casliaans are not known to be especially intelligent and would be unlikely to develop space flight on their own, trapped on their home planet, but it seems after many years of occupation and rebellions against the Esaal, they managed to steal enough technology for at least some splinter groups to make it into space and become a minority within Urgi freespace&quot;&quot;Hmm... They could be allies against the Esaal if necessary. There seems to be bad blood between them.&quot;&quot;Perhaps. The Casliaans do value warrior and martial tradition; but being consigned to be civilians in the Esaal&#039;s government; the highest of which are still seen as less honorable then the lowest military member; they likely became discontent. Their similarity in appearance may be coincidental; but the Casliaan&#039;s have a very unique genetic composition in which experiences and trauma an individual experiences through life influences their heritable traits directly; meaning a Casliaan who physically trains will have a child who is highly physically developed in the same way. It is the opposite to most species reproductive strategies, whose genes are assigned at birth and reproductive success is influenced by probability thru natural selection. It is theorized that the Casliaans all once had two eyes, for example, but a common ancestor lost one during life yet was successful enough for that trait to pass down to all future Casliaan descendants.&quot;&quot;Strange beasts. I&#039;d like to fight one of those some day!&quot;&quot;If the Accord wins the election in Urgi freespace, it&#039;s highly likely we could get access to some Casliaans for body scanning for our AI models and sparring sessions.

That doesn&#039;t bother me.”“Somewhere nice and quiet in the new colonies- a raw burial, no cremation or anything of course. So I can feed the biosphere. The Jaxtian way.””Of course, I&#039;ll arrange it.”“Thank you, my Son. Even though you are my dynastic heir, I still believe you were the best choice for the Hegemony&#039;s future, but even if I didn&#039;t pick you, I just wanted you to know that I&#039;d still love you all the same.””Oh? Even if I wasn&#039;t Supreme material?”“Yes, of course. You don&#039;t have to earn it.””Even if I ruin your legacy? Or if I succeed you, and declare your reign nothing but a footnote in my own, and decry your legacy as a soft and weak ruler; you&#039;d still love me then?” You ask, bitingly. You aren&#039;t sure why you&#039;re mad. You aren&#039;t supposed to be angry, you&#039;re supposed to be sad.Avae smiles. “Yes my Son, even though it would hurt me if I could know you were doing them after my death, I would still love you all the same. Because you are my son, I will love you no matter what. Unconditionally.”You hug your father and then he disappears into a pod, and his life is gone. It is sad, but it is the standard for your species. The alternative is your geriatric protien collapse syndrome; the current nemesis to Jaxtian longevity, far more painful and an inescapable limit to lifespan. The fact almost all Jaxtians will die in a euthanasia pod exactly like this, just like yourself, feels strangely humiliating in some way. The scientific, efficient method of minimizing suffering from a lifespan extended by the same system. That may be one such barrier you could break, if you were true to your word and truly did surpass your father&#039;s reign. Only time will tell.Suddenly, after Avae&#039;s suicide, you receive a notice about your other living Supreme ancestor. This one, far more important. You must talk to him immediately after what has transpired.“Hello our... master. My master.””Hello my great, great, great, great... uhh... ancestor. Cijan Anak. If that is the... entity, I am speaking to.”“My conciousness remains the same. Logically, I know I must be Cijan Anak, but half of my perspective remembers what happened on Andoen uncountable years ago as happening today... and then I woke up in the body of an primate. It&#039;s a little weird.”"

        "text": "The Threemind informed you just moments after your Father&#039;s death of an experiment that took place. As soon as your father was no longer the Supreme Ruler; Cijan Anak volenteered to be “connected” with the Celestial Blood to the being that has been trapped within the Life Machine for the past century. This being, the reconstiuted remains of a half-digested alien native to Andoen, one of the three eyed giants that your race discovered the ruins of during your early Faster-Then-Light explorations of your local cluster, was your only connection to that ancient and lost race. And, given your suspicions, were likely destroyed by the worms.”Celestial Blood being used to connect the minds of two living beings was forbidden by my father, right? Especially risky doing it to you, Cijan, one of the immortals. Doing this the moment he stepped out of command seems a little...” Treasnous. ”...Anti-Social.”“I suppose so, but it wasn&#039;t my decision either; at least half of me didn&#039;t ask to get woken up. The Threemind organized it. This was a special case, not two citizens, but a way to access special information. And I was deemed the best fit as my... brain would be most resiliant and suitable. The Hegemony already runs plenty of experiments and programs the Supreme Ruler may not like; they&#039;re simply not privy to them all, it&#039;s an unnecessary piece of overhead. There are AI models calculating which of the Hegemonic elite might defeat you in a duel for example, your majesty, just in case to prepare for a takeover for a new Supreme and prepare the empire&#039;s models and network for a sudden shift in power. You wouldn&#039;t outlaw a precautionary measure like this too, would you?””Hmph. I wouldn&#039;t let myself get beat in the first place. So it&#039;s a waste of processing power.” You say, but fully accepting the thought behind it."

Sounds a bit like Shskk Tssk Shishh. I was an Andoenite alien, though naturally we had our own name for it. I was also a female of my species, as if I needed any more dysophria having the memories of two people.””What did it... YOU look like?”“I looked... we... I don&#039;t know, how do you describe how you look!? I was a lot bigger, I can tell you that. And wasn&#039;t covered with coarse and itchy fur, I was smooth, and my skin was a lot darker then this. Except the face, the face was lighter then the rest of me.””What did you learn about the Andoen aliens? They seemed to be skilled at Starsight; they put us on the right track.”“Andoen technology is... WAS different then the Jaxtian method. Even now, my preliminary education sticks out in my mind as culturally normal and “obvious”, despite Jaxtian being much more developed and naturally closer. Andoen technology wasn&#039;t powered by fusion; it was powered by “ambient energy”, like the excess kinetic force of a wave rolling onto a beach, or the differential pressure between warm and cold layers in the atmosphere. This energy was captured and then used. Everything was very intentionally and carefully built and designed for its use in the future.””Including the Life-Pods?”“Yes. They were based on the Life Machine.””...”“I&#039;m sorry, my Lord. My memories are incomplete, and I wasn&#039;t part of the ruling caste. It was just a rumor, I think, the average person didn&#039;t know about it any more then we do. But Starsight, I, or we, knew about that. The Andoen aliens... or we, valued them. They were like our spirit guides. We knew about Starsight long before we ever had the capabilites to go into space at all.””I thought Starsight only occurred naturally in blind species? Like the worms, or the Oon?”“Our people didn&#039;t think so. I; Cijan speaking here; think it&#039;s because we had three eyes. The triscopular vision is far more advanced then binocular vision like most species have. Our visual cortext was well suited for “seeing” things in 3d space for this reason, similar to how Starseers “see” things in their minds eye.”"

It&#039;s because of the worms, right? We experienced it. The older adults talked about it a lot, about the “Cyte” approaching. Half of us wanted to run, to find a dark place to hide to escape the worms, but they could only do that by stabbing out one of their three eyes, because we did Starsight so naturally the worms could find us otherwise. I don&#039;t really think they could have made a ship that went that far; to escape into space. Most didn&#039;t listen to them.””And the Cyte itself?”“But I didn&#039;t know anything about it, until the day it arrived. First, the sun started to go dark. Then, shapes came down from the sky. Ships, I think. Then, worms began appearing everywhere. Without the sun, the worms could appear anywhere without being burned by its UV radiation safely. That&#039;s why we built self defense guns all over the planet&#039;s surface, but it didn&#039;t do anything, the worms still had weapons from space that could bomb the stronghouses. Whever we hid in bunkers, they would just appear in a dark corner as if from nowhere. Their ability to “teleport” through hyperspace travel, to appear in the belly of a new host as a parasite in space, weaponized exactly as they had done to you. To the Jaxtians, I mean.””But then you were... revived. Your... presence?”“Oh, you mean the Life-Pods? Yeah. It copied my brain waves and let me come back, though really, it&#039;s just a copy.””....Cijan?”“Hmm? Oh, you&#039;re wondering how that&#039;s possible? How it isn&#039;t based on a “soul”? Well, Andoenites believed in souls, for sure. But I don&#039;t, and now that I&#039;ve seen the evidence as a Jaxtian, I can explain what my more ignorant half believed. Hyperspace is just the 4th spatial dimension. It&#039;s the reason why some things in 3d space are “closer” when travelling “faster then light”, and why it requires so much energy to get up there. Third dimenional matter travelling along a fourth axis of movement. So yes, my brainwaves wouldn&#039;t be accessible in 3d space, but in Hyperspace they were must closer. The Life Machine just copied those. Mine.””...Right.”“You sound disappointed.””I&#039;m not sure what I was expecting. I guess it, or you, died, and then you weren&#039;t aware of being eaten inside a pod?”“No. I just remember running to an underground shelter. It was dark. Then I got eaten, I think. Then next thing I know I was in the body of a Jaxtian man, with the memories of both. If you have any other questions, I&#039;d be more then happy to answer them, your Majesty!”&gt;Ask him a Question (Write-In)&gt;Find out if Cijan can do Starsight now?&gt;Punish him &amp; the Threemind for the unauthorized experiment&gt;Let him rest, he&#039;s already helped you out a lot"

They mock the Hegemony and your culture, calling you spartan and fake; a hundred times more authentic then the pure military utility of Esaal society and not whorishly sold and commodified like the Consortium species; yet that still isn&#039;t authentic and high brow enough for them. Not only that, but previous Supreme Rulers have tried to share fruits from your tree with them; letting them tour the conquered territories, the marvelous city of Myym, seeing your multi-racial society as it flourishes, and what do they do with this gift? They sent out custom sicknesses to weaken your industrial workforce and laugh at the cruel fate they inflicted upon one Farro Val. The last straw came just a few years ago, when it was revealed a biocontaiminate on a colony world, the mysterious Breathstealer Flowers that almost killed a bunch of colonists at a special school, was not a Hazaar leftover, but something the Aristocrats planted intentionally on that planet during their tours of the Hegemony. So in the same breath where they praised Hass Takar for destroying their cast-off Hazaar; they also planted seeds to poison and potentially kill his people.

The Consortium will commit and endure the most underhanded tricks and cost of life in war, but will always be willing to come to the table for trade.

You can split your fleet however you want to attack planets (pink number is how strong they are), which will lead to rolling AFTER you decide on a battle plan. So you could attack six planets with 50 fleet power each with your starting 300 or whatever. The 90 on the left is how many reinforcements the enemy gets per turn, and the right number with the Hegemony gets per turn in addition to any troops you have out. However you can only attack sectors you have access to, which means having at least one defeated planet with your ships in it to move on to a commented sector. The four sectors on top can be attacked from the main fleet whenever you want.Each sector is like a region in RISK, meaning fully taking it over reduces enemy reinforcements by that much (the number with the plus in the same color as tge sector). So if you take over the red sector you&#039;ll reduce enemy reinforcements by 10 so instead of 90 they just get 80. After you decide your attack plan then we&#039;ll roll to see if you take over the planets and how many ships you lose. Also every 10 ships you outnumber the enemy let&#039;s you blow up an extra one on a win, and defenders win ties but since you&#039;re Halam the &quot;war leader&quot; you just always win ties because he&#039;s based like that."

        "text": "&gt;&gt;6270404As someone else said, we also want to limit Aristocrat Reinforcements by breaking up their regions. To that end, and based on the guidelines in &gt;&gt;6270360 I propose the following:Expeditionary Fleet Alpha (Vasetaker): 160 ships &amp; battleship. Strike the yellow +16 cluster as hard as possible, dividing the fleet proportionally to the target populations of targetable worlds. Expeditionary Fleet Beta (Independants): - 30 against the blue independant world with 16 defense - 15 ships against the independant 9 and 40 against the independant 28 to hopefully secure the 6. Expeditionary Fleet Sigma (Disruptors): - 35 ships to take the 29 planet in blue. - 20 ships to take the 12 planet in red. Next turn the intent is to move NE with the Blue fleet and take the 7 while pushing reinforcements into the sector, widestrikeing the brown vase with alpha, fortifying Red, and consolidating Gamma onto the other independants or diving in where needed. I&#039;m not sure how the math of combat wins (if it&#039;s d100 or d20 or what), and I assume that we&#039;ll lose at least one battle (with the red 12 being the most likely) to the hostile ships. Assuming all attacks are successful, in round 2 the Aristocrats with get effectively +41 ships while we&#039;ll get around +10. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s feasible to win even with large starting advantage. My larger strategy is to roll the yellow vase and the blue cyclops clustors while defending at Red. Then roll Orange while disrupting purple, and still playing defensive at red. Maybe snag the other independants along the way, even if that&#039;s likely to make them hostile (if they didn&#039;t exist I would have just sunk those resources into Blue instead looking for a 2 turn victory instead of 3 turns. However, if this is just Risk and we can just roll through worlds without worry, then a better ide would be to conquer blue and yellow this turn while harassing red, for the sweet +74 pt. swing in manpower disruption, and leave the independants alone. Then next turn boost the Blue force and roll orange while using the Brown force to disrupt purple. If that worked we&#039;d essentially have won with a +31 vs a +12 from the Green Tree alone. So to an extent the strategy depends on if this is planet by planet warfare or cluster by cluster."

Starting with top-left with strong advantage to avoid ship loss then top right next turn, this is to leverage a good part of our 100-ship advantage. A few more to ensure no loss on the two first clusters, as well as triggering thresh for bonusesShip repart : &gt;57 on top-left +6 cluster (overnumber by 20 ships) reparted 38 on the 28 planet, 19 on the 9 planet, triggering two time the bonus&gt;26 on +2 clusterThis grants -8 to reinforcement by turn; additional one-time -3 because 3time 10-ship overpower and should let us take the rest of the cluster, regarding how it goes.Main force Deepram : 217 ships; yellow clusterRepart : &gt;15 on 5 planet&gt;28 on 18 planet&gt;43 on 33 planet&gt;51 on 41 planet&gt;80 ships on 62 planetThis means taking away 16 more reinforcements and one-time -5The would yield on complete success permanent -24 and one time -8 on reinforcement.Then, the concern would be having enough ships to attack the capital planets of sectors. Rushing the 109-one Wincon is a no-brainer; once we have yelow and purple we&#039;ll have access to 69 and 38 that should be manageable even reinforced.This sector is great value according to &gt;&gt;6270401 and might not be after reinforcements.One of my main concern is &quot;big planets&quot; : if 90 reinforcements goes to a 109 planet, the game will get really hard."

ATTACK!&quot;&gt;&gt;6270483RULESEach planetary battle is rolled separately and until one side is completely exhausted and destroyed. For the sake of simplicity, we will perform the attack in the order of the given battleplan. So ours will begin on the top left 38 vs 28 light green planet, then once that battle is complete, we will move on to the 19 vs 9 small gray moon within the same cluster, and so on.Each round is a player roll. On each round, before rolling, for every 10 points a side outnumbers the other, the smaller side loses a ship/unit of power from the numbers advantage.All rolls are 2d20. The first number represents the Hegemony, the second will be the Aristocrat defensive forces. Whichever side rolls higher destroys the winning number rolled of enemy ships. For example, if you roll 17 vs the Aristocrat 14, you blow up 17 Aristocrats ship. Then, roll again. A side can only destroy a number of ships equal to or less than their number of ships present in the battle; the Aristocrat moon of 9 ships can only destroy a maximum of 9 ships on a successful roll regardless of how high they roll.Because of Halam&#039;s skill, you always win a tie, attacking or defending. Blow up the number of enemy ships you rolled. (ie; 12 vs 12, destroy 12 ships).Players roll for the Hegemony&#039;s attack. Players can roll multiple times, but please give everyone a chance to contribute and test their luck.&gt;Roll (Remember; you can type &quot;dice+2d20&quot; without the quotes to roll!)"

UoP was calibrated to be the theoretical equivalent of 1 ship.&gt;Theatre of operations : The main assault force sent on the Yellowvase Cluster, while two splinter-fleet alpha and beta attacked singled-out small planetary clusters The Yellowvase Cluster Battle resulted in the complete loss of 2 fringe clusters and almost-complete control of Yellowcase Cluster by Janxtian army.Janxtian army lost 111 ships, depleting 204 UoP and cutting 8 of the 90 projected UoP by turn.&gt;Limitation of current study : This thesis details circumstances of a surprise assault - meaning mastery over attackers and target. As the conflict evolve in the future, we might be confronted to defensive situations meaning a need for more adequate tooling to decide between reinforcement and assault. However, the author believe the analysis will remain of great merit to chose attack target for musterable forces. &gt;Section I/ Superiority advantage : Fire SuppressionThis is the observation of the mechanical effect of &quot;On each round, before rolling, for every 10 points a side outnumbers the other, the smaller side loses a ship/UoP from the numbers advantage.&quot; The goal of the study is to evaluate On fringe worlds: Killed 4 UoP on First Cluster Killed 2 UoP on Second ClusterOn Yellowvase cluster : Killed 2 UoP on miniyellow moon according to simulations, mattered a little bit as this saved 1 ship (7 instead of 6; see Section II) Killed 1 UoP on AnthraciteAsteroid according to simulations, didn&#039;t matter practically Killed 6 UoP on GreyRock - which mattered greatly in improving the less-than-ideal outcome. Killed 5 UoP on Kakimoon. Killed 16 UoP on Greenclay - helping the Flawless win thanks to the excellent planification of the Assault of our Supreme Leader."

According to projective analysis, the doctrine killed 5 of their UoP on GreyRock [lost battle] (this antisocial remark was corrected to : tactical skirmish to prepare occupation). Mechanic saved 8 ships; Those 8 ships turned capital asset later in the battle, each turning a tactical dire situation in a draw (without the mechanic, Kakimoon would had +5 UoP) Saved 1 ship on Kakimoon assault No impact on STOMP of AnthraciteAsteroid battle.Conclusion : Doctrine of Superiority granted us 41 free UoP, and saved 28 Hegemonic ships.Of course, both mechanic are linked. Effect of diminushing offensive capacities is greatly lessen when there is over 20 UoP remaining so aiming to decrease UoP under 20 is strategically solid. Moreover, we can increase the worth of attacking 20 or less UoP with at least 10, ideally 20 units overpowering. Adequate tooling taking those in account remain to be developped.Superiority advantage paradoxically yield best reward in losing situations."

But a new battle doctrine was created for this campaign; something requiring the endurance, discipline, and unique capabilities of the Hegemony&#039;s other warrior phenotype.Vetuckers equipped with the brand new Broadback weapon system have been deployed as your primary ground forces on the Aristocrat planets. Essentially a mobile reassembler backpack and attached weapon; the broadback sucks up useful materials from the enviorment, quickly recycles them, and supplie them as ammunition for the primary weapon system. Conductive metals used for electrostatic nets and darts to stun and fry swarms and smaller opponents, powerful magnetic slugs for armored and large-bodied targets, and flammable gases absorbed and used for the powerful plasma throwers meant to burn up all organic material. On planets whose biosphere wants to kill you; every plant and tree is an enemy combatant, and must be treated as such.The Vetuckers move in lines; combing the surface immediately after ariel bombardment. It was not expected that kinetic weapons alone could destroy the Aristocrats defenses; which is why these soldiers were deployed to clean up after. It is also not expected to be able to permanently dislodge the Aristocrat defenses; total destruction of the topsoil and underground root system would be too costly and difficult. So instead, as grazing animals do, your soldiers decimiate the local ecosystem before moving to the next. Too dangerous for constant extraction; they&#039;re expected to stay on the planet for days at a time. While its not safe to let them consume the organic matter; they can at least drink recycled and distilled water and have a salt lick installed on the inside of their helmets, and only need to sleep for an hour or two at a time given the Vetucker biology. Special braces on their legs allow them to sleep standing up; ensuring formation can be kept even as some rest and others advance. Who knew the Hegemony&#039;s herbivores would end up being the perfect soldiers?"

Good, you enjoy watching them cry into the void.If anything; it is has actually been a positive to your reputation. The Supreme Commander of the Esaal military has actually sent you a direct message.”Ahh, Jaxtians! You&#039;ve decided to take a bite out of the Aristocrats as well? Yes! Haha, I love it!””Thank you. Looks like we share a common enemy. Even if the Esaal and ourselves haven&#039;t always seen... eye to eye.

We still have fresh data from our own conflicts with the pinkos. We&#039;d be willing to trade it for... a favor.””A favor? What favor?””I don&#039;t know yet!””Well, I am sorry. You may be the closest thing we have a friend in space, Esaal friends, but I would hate to strain our relations by refusing to fulfill our end of the bargain in the future when it would be an unacceptable-””Hold your refusal, Jaxtian noble! Our peoples have known each other for some time, and we are kindred spirits. Fighting with honor, allowing our defeated warriors home without humiliation, and vice versa; you know we wouldn&#039;t ask for something absurd in return for something as small as information? I don&#039;t know what I would ask for, because I am old. An old Esaal is not long for this world. I must die a warrior&#039;s death. But my successor... they will know what to ask you for. I promise, it will not be a trick, nothing massive or expensive or unforward to our relationship. Surely we have earned enough trust in you for that?”It appears the Esaal want to offer a trade. In exchange for giving you very useful information about the Aristocrats from their previous campaigns; you will owe them a small favor in the future. The Threemind tells you that accepting this deal will give us information on where the Aristocrats will send their reinforcements and where they will likely flee; and as you know, the Aristocrats also border the burgeoning Urgi state."

I see.”“Yes. If we accept the Esaal&#039;s offer, not only would it give us an advantage in our war, but also let us influence the election subtly by reducing the militarization level of a faction by one bar. Becuase of how spread out and disjointed the Urgi are, we can pick and choose where this will happen; plus, don&#039;t forget, this is for a favor in the future. We you could freely decline if you so choose.””But, that would strain our relationship with the Esaal... Hmm...

I&#039;m assuming that we need to pull our forces off the planets to launch them at future conquests. Also, yellow sector looks like a Swall head. Purple has a shown strength of 280. Our yellow forces are at 145. Our outworld forces are at 54. So pre-battleship we are about even, but due to our local superiority they should be bleeding troops to power differential (unless we just see the purple capitol with 199 power or something.

Assuming we conquor purple soundly I guess we&#039;d try to make peace with red, threaten green with destruction, then try to roll east into orange, followed by a desperate push on the blue capital. We haven&#039;t seen reinforcements get applied to either side yet, so hard to say. Maybe we spank Purple, decide the really we only needed three capitals, torch Green&#039;s home and leave? Can we torch the 8 yellow world on our way out? Can the outland ships reach blue this turn? If the enemy is getting +90ish forces a turn (or even +40 with purple and yellow depleted) and we are getting +0, we&#039;re going to struggle either way."

So at 189 ships we could eat the nine, mostly eat the 21, then work our way up the food chain and blast the 109? Execpt post 6270386 says the outnumber bonus only take effect on a win, wheras 62770881 says that it is done before rolling. Still, if the enemy get reinforcements every turn and we don&#039;t I don&#039;t think that this is now a winnable scenario without significant luck on our side. If Purple drops 90 forces on their capital this turn maybe we can still conquer purple, but then they&#039;ll drop 60-70ish somewhere else next turn and we&#039;ll still need two capitals, assuming that reconquest isn&#039;t a thing (despite the initial rules saying take and hold the capitals instead of just burning them). I don&#039;t think that we have enough gas in the tank for that. So despite having read the posts and the idea of reinforcements, it doesn&#039;t make sense to me. Also, if the +&#039;s were used to generate that 90 then the neutrals are contributing to the enemy war effort rather than just protecting themselves. Narratively, are the Aristocrats producing 90+/- fleet strength a turn vs. our 300 strength expeditionary fleet? This is what led me to the roving 90 fleet hypothesis, with portions leaving if their home system was burned (ie. the roving reinforcements)."

Here&#039;s my strategy to win the war :Bomb the most important planet, purple capital.T2 : 30 on yellow8 (if it remains at 8) will reinforce, 170 on Purple as discussed.

I&#039;d say the safe way to get both might be full cluster takeover + full capital planet hold.You guys are behind me for doing the funniest Full-Aristocrat-Humiliation battleplan?"

Beyond the escape routes used by the Aristocrats, something the Esaal very desperately wanted during their own war to stop them from slipping away, you also learn their battle tactics. As it turns out, these proto-Hazaar are very defensively minded, mostly caring about retaking lost planets. It seems that the Aristocrat reinforcement numbers will be evenly split among all sectors you have conquered planets within, attacking the capitals if you own them, otherwise attacking the weakest planet you control, denying you access to a bridge to deep strikes into their territory if you can&#039;t hold it. Also, as a rule, it seems the outlying secondary clusters on the edge of Aristocrat space will never have an attempt to retake them once captured; preferring much more to retain the dignity of the main Aristocrat ideals. We can hopefully use this information to our advantage, and that&#039;s it worth whatever the Esaal ask of us in the future to repay it.In the meantime, you are busy doing administrative study and optimization of your first attack fleet, especially to improve future waves.

Weak nations are often found to project force outwards, with endless military parades and showboating, while the strong ones keep their true power hidden away. Tale as old as time.””Hmm... This will certainly help in our efforts to influence the election, but as of how, I am not sure.”“One more thing, your Majesty.” Usis adds. “...It may be prudent to warn the wealthy and powerful among the Urgi of your plan to guide the Aristocrats through their territory.

Very useful! You cut off their escape, pushing the fleeing enemies into the unclaimed Urgi interspace territory; specifically towards Accord stations. As the Urgi are very spread out and independent, meaning it is trivial to push them towards the Accord&#039;s defenses and forcing them to intervene.

Hopefully, this sentiment is kept by the Pacifist voting cores...Meanwhile, on a parched desert world in Urgi space; a few birds sprawl out in a shelter.

Thankfully, the world was bombed so badly by the Esaal the bioweapons only remain in that one region; allowing an Urgi clan to live here.

Learning Starsight may be a point of pride to you; but it is the domain of the worms. Once you know it, you become vunerable to those who specalize in it. Obviously, I cannot stop you, but I strongly advise that, in this case, the Supreme Ruler is too valuable not to stay hidden in the dark.””You are certainly right in that you cannot stop me. See it done!”“Whatever you wish, your Majesty.”Unfrotunately, because you made no attempt to stop the Vetuckers from persuing Starsight careers, the number of military recruits for your ground invasion forces and unique Broadback weapon technology squads has dropped. Both the quality and number of applicants take a small but noticable dip, equating to a loss of -6% of your future attack waves. Hopefully, your approach will pay off in the future."

The Jaxtians have already taken useful genes to upgrade themselves; the Vetuckers, the Swall, the Migrators; as well as taking inspiration from worm, whale, and Hazaar biotechnology. The Hegemony has a long history of tampering with the Jaxtian genome; even as far back as Akule the Unspeakable, mixing the Jaxtian races with selective breeding to try and keep the most favorable traits. But for them? No such eugenic compulsion; other then the selective breeding of the Swall&#039;s own economic and cultural importance on family-planning and the Vetuckers selective breeding underneath Hegemonic leadership.”Your father really is the gift that keeps on giving. You were so confident just a few years ago you would use him as a stepping stone to do truly great things... but now you&#039;re feeling a bit inadequate again. He certainly had more foresight then you do. Once the war with the Aristocrats is over, and the Urgi factions changing and morphing with politics over the years; what will your legacy be? For living beings; nothing lasts longer then their biology; the living legacy of genetics. At least you have time to create something lasting.”I&#039;m assuming we only have the budget and room for one upgrade each... pulling from each other.”“Of course, your Majesty. Trying to greatly modify a genome all at once before it has time to be absorbed and fully enter the breeding pool could lead to disasterous results; gene-specific diseases, birth defects from unpredicted gene clashing, unwanted speciation...””Because of their different phenotypes; is that why we&#039;re limiting crossover?”“As you know, your Majesty, the Vetuckers are large bodied, bulky, herbivouours herd animals that mostly live on land; especially in colder and more mountainous and arid regions. They are known to have short lifespans and are not especially intelligent. The Swall meanwhile are carniviours, amphibious, small bodied, sleek, who produce their own biotoxin. They have a high k-selection reproductive bias, with longer lifespans and are very intelligent; possible more intelligent then Jaxtians. They are about as different as two species can be; ignoring vast genetic distance and totally seperate evolutionary origins. Not to mention the gene upgrades traded to us by the Aristocrats slightly containmenating the “pure” bank of genetic information to work with. So trying to adapt to each others morphological DNA would be quite...””-BORING! Just give me the choices already.”"

The Swall seem to be distantly related to the “Zharks” of their homeworld; carnivirous and predatory boney fish; but lost their long tails and fins a few million years ago along with their ability to move on land and bipedalism. Vetuckers still have their tails, useful for their digitigrade locomotion. We could develop the Swall tailbone; granting them a full length tail; not very useful on land, but could assist with increasing their body mass and size as well as increasing their swimming ability even further.””It does look weird seeing them walk around with tails. And the slavery connotation...”“Second, as the Swall are obligate carnivours, their diet is quite limited and expensive. It would be possible to grant them a limited form of herbivorism; allowing them to eat some plant matter, most likely fruits and vegetables; similar to Jaxtians. This wouldn&#039;t necessarily improve their nutrition, as they can already get everything from meat, as well as not change their teeth or jaw, so the food would have to be prepared; it would just make it easier for them to live on planets with less ocean cover and space stations where aquifarming. Plus, a massive increase to the Hegemony&#039;s profits if we can supplement even one meal a week with cheap farmed food...””Anything else?”“As you know, your Majesty, Vetuckers are mammals. And mammals produce milk to feed their young. It&#039;s a defining trait.””Uh huh.”“And Vetucker women are very... mammalian.””Uh huh.”“So we could take some of those “mammalian” genes and-””SWALL TITTIES?!”“It&#039;s possible.””You know I&#039;m interested... but even I pause at the practical application.”“Well, your Majesty, Swall women do not have any mammary glands. Their young hatch from eggs; fully weaned and capable of eating meat and even limited ability to hunt small prey; though parents naturally still help with the gathering of food even before their rise to intelligence. As such, milk could supplement the diet of the young, though it&#039;s not strictly necessary. It is also predicted that, given the great danger and strain on the body of Swall pregnancy and egg-laying; extra fat reserves could actually help Swall females sustain themselves and bounce back from the reproductive cycle healthier. It&#039;s likely this will increase the survival rate of female Swall during reproduction and increase brith rates by a small amount. But it&#039;s still at least... partially superficial.””Hey Threes? Can you shine your hologram projector over here on these Danbos and make &#039;em yellow for me? I just want to check something real quick. And turn your camera off.”“Of course, your Majesty.” The Threemind replies, strained. “Whatever you wish.”"

        "text": "”But what about the Vetuckers? What useful adaptations they could get from the Swall?”“The Swall possess a few unique adaptations. Swall have limited regeneration of skin, scales, and teeth which slowly regrow all throughout their lives; with missing scales being one of the strongest indicator of aging. They can also regrow the webbing between their digits and their fingers and toes up to a certain point; but it mostly affects keratin. We can implant this ability into Vetuckers which won&#039;t grant them much survivability beyond their already impressive toughness; but it would allows their horns to regenerate.”“Horns are an important part of their status and self-esteem, especially the males. I assume this would result in a higher average happiness.””Yes, they would be happier and could also aid with reducing their aging; or at least the appearance of it.”“I&#039;m using the Vetuckers as soldiers now. Anything that could help with that?”“The Swall air-bladder, used for swimming and staying neutrally boyuant could be adapted to mutate one of the Vetucker&#039;s multiple stomache chambers to store the gases they produce when digesting.””What... possible benefit could that have?”“Well, it would make them a bit lighter on their feet, though it could lead to uncomfortable bloating. But the gas would be flammable.””SO!?”“You asked for combat adaptations, your Majesty. Maybe you could put a pilot light by their mouth or ignition source; and they could burp up fire?””...Alright, that is actually a kinda cool. Carry on.”“Lastly; it would be possible to grant a certain amount of “individuality” genes into the Vetucker brains. While the Hegemony has a good understanding of genetics and their link to intelligence, cross species interactions like this are tricky. But it is predicted that this mutation would make the Vetuckers significantly more intelligent at the cost of some of their groupthink and herd mentality. In other words, they&#039;d be closer to Jaxtians and Swall in terms of how they think and operate; but be more self centered and ambitious.””Hmm. Is there really no way to increase their operational abilities without changing this?”“Unfortunately, no. These seem to be linked. You can make them smarter, but at the cost of changing a core aspect of their culture and social dynamic. They likely won&#039;t be quite as smart as a Swall or Jaxtian, and they won&#039;t have geniuses in the same way we do, but we&#039;ll see more of them in science and high-level fields and positions.”"

Is it possible?”“...Yes, it is. But it would take a large amount of resources to cross-reference our entire genetic library for useful mutations for both species. It would also be quite an expensive undertaking, and finally, it would be quite against tradition.””What tradition?”“Our belief in Jaxtians Supremacy.

Full genetic donor program just isn&#039;t in the cards right now.”While you may or may not agree with the idea of sharing the Jaxtian genetic “treasure” with the Swall and Vetuckers; for practical concerns you just can&#039;t accept it. Instead, a smaller scale gene upgrade to be introduced to the next generation. You decide to grant the Vetuckers limited regeneration; though your current war will be over by the time this fully difuses into the population, this should aide in their already impressive survability and toughness. Plus, being able to grow their horns back naturally would be nice to have, you&#039;d think you&#039;d like that if you were one of them.For the Swall, your decision is more tricky. You have the one you obviously want to win; the thought of some small but tasteful yellow breasts adorning their figures interests you as a male, but the more you think about it... isn&#039;t it actually the largest benefit? Mammals became the dominant and most intelligent type of species on many worlds for a reason. Higher selection bias towards nurturing and feeding the next generation. It goes hand in hand with their survival strategy. Perhaps they may be just a little bit less hydrodynamic but...“Ugh! Gross! You aren&#039;t actually going to graft on breasts to Swall women, your Majesty!” Christopher Streakeyes, part of your Hegemonic elite council, seems to disagree.”What? There are a long list of benefits, honest!” You say with a laugh, a little embaressed. ”Your women are too skinny, Streaks! We need more Swall for future generations in science and mathematics; and this directly helps.”“The Swall don&#039;t like having their most intimate moments messed with. Our eggs are scared. Surely, you&#039;ll allow Swall to deny the gene upgrade, like your Father did?””Huh? Of course not. It isn&#039;t useful unless fully spread throughout the population. I am not my Father. You&#039;ll do as I say, as I am the Supreme Ruler, and that is that.”“What!? You can&#039;t- You can&#039;t do this! You are a pervert!””...What did you just say?”"

But you didn&#039;t learn that you need to back up that bravado with some skills with a knife!”Christopher chokes, acidic ink-spit trailing down his chin and burning into your robe&#039;s sleeve. He could try to spit it into your eyes and blind you; but your doctors would just grow you new corneas while you twist his head off. It&#039;s of no concern to you; but he doesn&#039;t spit.

He falls to the ground like a dead and fallen branch, recovering just enough to crawl into a deep bow.“T-Thank you for... your... mercy... your maj- majesty...””That&#039;s alright, hope you learned your lesson. And I didn&#039;t squeeze you too hard.” You flex your arm, feeling a slight pain in your deepest veins. You didn&#039;t think he was that heavy, but still holding him up and almost breaking his neck with one arm really got you sore.“I am ready.. for... punishment...””Ehh... I&#039;m not gonna pull your arm off like Agori, I&#039;m not that sadistic. To my own people, anyway. I think throttling you was punishment enough. Besides, you&#039;re supposed to be some kind of computer genius, right? Why are you slurking around Hegemonic high society anyway?”Streakeyes seems hesitant to speak, possibly due to the difficulty of breathing or not to incriminate himself. The Threemind quickly chimes in, whispering directly to you.“It was thought better to not make any large scale changes or upgrades to the computer system during your pivitol projects in the Urgi election or with the Aristocrat war as to avoid interference, your Majesty.””Ahh, well in that case Streaks, I&#039;m going to need you soon after this is over. Improve your skills and prepare your projects; you&#039;re too valuable to die over something stupid like this. Go now.”“T-Thank you... Master...”Of course, Christopher had no chance to defeat you. The reason why people always talk about Alpha males like Agori or Bantam getting defeated in duels is because of how unusual it is. In Agori&#039;s case, he was old and surprised by a clever child, who grew up to the greatest duelist of all time by the way; and Bantam only lost because of Hass Takar&#039;s ambition and because he seemed to almost “let him”. Jaxtians are strong, and Alpha males doublly so; you have a distinct advantage in dueling. If a regular Jaxtian noble would have a hard time defeating you, a phyiscally unremarkable Swall is simply no real threat.In the coming months and years; interest in the Swall&#039;s new “mammalian features” would be seen both in horny young boys of the Hegemony, but moreso the womanfolk and softer side of the Hegemony as well. With their own parents unable to help, Swall females would be forced to seek knowledge among the Vetucker and Jaxtian female. As Swall women are more masculine in both apperance and mannerism then most females of the Hegemony, they&#039;ve always been the most isolated; and this has bridged the gap a bit. The alien “otherness” of the Swall has been reducd, shifting them closer to the other Hegemonic races as they have become more mammalian.“An unexpected, but fortituous outcome, your Majesty.” The Threemind says. You nod your head sagely, as though you are the wised Supreme Ruler of all time.”Through boobies... unity.”"

The grasses you have been tending to for years grow in orderly rows and patches, the chaotic wind bobs them as the sound issues from the microchannels along their sheathe.~shoo shh shoooo shooo schooo hoo~For now, it is nothing but noise, the almost silent windchimes. But soon, it will be your masterpiece. You hear the sound of far away droning, and glance up, to see the nuptial flight of the warriors; the caste in your society that makes war.“Oh... that is not good. Bad, bad day. Rotten bad day.” To see them in the sky can only mean one thing. The Wisdom Trees communicate with each other; a society across the stars. It is slower then the Starsight that you loan from the worms; the Star Lanes purchased with the sacrificed, specially-grown Aristocrat babies filled with wonder. But the trees have their own method, across space, where they can feel what the others feel. You water their roots with the celestial wine; and they know what the others know. You do not question it.But the flight of the warriors can only mean you are under attack; and so soon after the Esaal had their turn? Aristocrats have no interest in a war; even though you are the pinnacle of your society. You want nothing to do with it!Your society is divded into three estates. The third estate, the worker-drones, who do nothing but work and tend the wisdom trees and gather the materials and do all the make-doings. Endlessly and thanklessly, their only purpose is to work. As filled with light as the rest of your kinds; but only knowing work. The second estate are the warriors, the ones who fight when your people are attacked, only sometimes to be roused from their slumber among the roots deep under the Wisdom Trees; the cicadal awakening. Their only purpose is to fight; and in months, all of these warriors will be dead, win or lose, as their only purpose is to fight. And then, finally, there is the first estate; the Aristocrats, whose purpose is to live and experience all life has to offer. That is your purpose, and one you wear with pride.As you like to put it? Those who work, those who fight, and those who play."

This is the reason why your society is the greatest and most advanced of all. Beyond your absolute control over biology; you have a certain level of understanding of this fact that other species and beings in space do not. Beauty is not subjective; it requires rigerous and an expert hand to craft it, and to apprecaite it. The highest eschalons of any discipline can only be truly known by those who are bred for it; physical, mental, so why not creative?What purpose is there for entertainment on the lowborn, the animal, the common, the villein? It only exists to sustain some mental compulsion for boredom or relaxation before the next day of toil. What appreciation can truly be had for something beautiful by one born to destroy, whose muscles and sharp ridges would as easily tear any soft and frilly thing as capable of appreciating its touch? There is not purpose to it; it is a waste of time. It is much better for them to know nothing of the sort. Only work, only their purpose, day in and day out, until they gracelessly expire.The Esaal cannot appreciate pretty things, cannot advance the form of art, everything is to be a resource and power-play for their ego and thirst for domination. Any species so obsessed in this way is doomed to absolute inner vacancy. The Consortium is worse yet; mimicking the pursuit of art but purely for capital. All creations to feed some bottom line and dumbed down for the lowest common dominator. Every single beautiful idea or cultural artifact to be melted down and cast off for parts to be sold on some marketplace. Yuck! It makes you sick! Only the Jaxtians seem to understand the truth, in some limited way. They have idle nobles too; generational families of high class aristocracy, exclusive, held seperate from the crass and common. But they are so obsessed with efficacy, equality of opportunity, obedience to a single vision; art cannot grow in such an enviormnet. There is some spark of creativity among them; but it is twisted and boxed in with iron walls. Not like your lovely, lovely hedges. Not like your lovely little leaf-eaters and lovely little whistling weeds and the lovely little pond where-"

Hundreds of complex protien chains and many, many calories of energy are needed to feed the machines they must build; space-capable acidic spewing insectoid ships, unfurling to catch solar winds and accelerate to as fast as light; and you tell it to scrap lichen from the rocks... But what can it do? You stay silent, and after a few moments, the warrior motions to the others to go about their tasks. You stand there very smugly and feel very clever for tricking the lesser estate of your society. Who cares what they want? What does any of that ugly, ugly fighting have to do with the beautiful things you care about?...Of course, the drones that live on your fief have no such authority over the warriors.

You will not roll for these, just increase the number on the planet to make it more likely to survive an enemy attack.Remember; you may only attack sectors with arrows directly to your main fleet number OR adjoining sectors in which you have at least one captured planet. After your forces are assigned, rolling will begin. Because this is your second wave; all enemy sectors that have not been fully conquered will contribute reinforcements to the enemy fleet, which will attack you back. You can reduce the number of enemy reinforcements by fully conquering an enemy sector.&gt;Recall (Choose how many forces from captured planets to recall back to the fleet)&gt;Attack Phase (Choose enemy planets to attack and how many forces to send to each)"

The odds where heavily stacked against Cluster-4 The eagerness of our bravest ships to be the first on the frontline to score marks for the Hegemony turned to be reckless : well-layed traps took care of them. Then, those acid-spitting drones directly breached our ships&#039; containments to spread bio-abomination. We were not Sleeping Sotten, but we can only awe in front of their battlefield mastery, inflicting us 2 loss for each of their own - days after the fight even took place. The material and men have been spent; we can&#039;t take and maintain the position as now.The importance of taking those cluster must be reasserted : Tactically, is it worth? We&#039;ll need to allocate, and probably lose, a fair share of men to fully take the two resisting Astral Bodies. What for? So that Aristocrats can scrape a handful less ship to impale on our defenses?Assuming we&#039;re halfway through the war, a force of 34 ships deployed to Cluster-4 should take it with minimal loss.

Let&#039;s count 190 as the hegemonic mustered power.If bombing is still an option : &gt;Bomb Green capital, bringing it to 8&gt;Send 30 ships their, for autowin in worst case scenario&gt;go knock on Ully&#039;Andule door with 265 to 424 shipsActually, 309 seems like an Autowin number; might not be the smallest oneIf we can&#039;t bomb, we&#039;d have to split our fleet smartly but next turn win is doable as long as we hold the bridgehead"

The beams fire out traction force rotating in opposite directions, pulling objects apart in a twisting motion; crystal structures and solids are only barely damaged by it, and it would only scrap the paint off of an Azurium hull. But again organic things? The effect is devastating; rapidly blending the organic ships of the Aristocrats into fluids spilling out into space.&quot;Hahaha!&quot; You laugh in victory, clapping your hands together as your superiority is proven once again.

I think that the appropriate defense number against this is 31 (so they&#039;ll be initially knocked down to 10, max loss brings us to 21, they go to 8. Max loss brings us to 13. So we&#039;d need to lose 4 times to lose a 31 vs. 12. We have a total of 281 ground forces and 12 plantets, two of which are capitals. So if we leave 31 at each capital and 1 on each other world (at total garrison of 72) we have 209 ground forces to reassign. We haven&#039;t been asked for the battle plan yet.

You task him with destroying the wealth of the Accord, but specify it must be as limited in damage life as possible; after all, they&#039;re who you intend to ally with in the future. The Smuggler ends up destroying an automated shipping and refueling outpost in a high traffic region of Urgi space; causing a great deal of economic disruption and the loss of several million credits worth of goods. The Accord struggles with the loss, finding themselves by far the poorest faction. But this comes with the silver lining of making them more spunky and resourceful; as well as forcing them to offer better deals for captains and crews who want to join them. In many ways, they are like the early Hegemony now, resourcefully maximizing their resources in local space and relying on inferior technologies to get by and stay under the radar. The Pacifist crowd also likes the Accord&#039;s lack of military hierarchy and expansionism; and Isolationists among the council are strongly aligned with the Accord as well, given how similar they are to how the Urgi have traditionally lived; living in the liminal spaces between the stars.Much the opposite of this; the Aristocrats, being culturally and politically powerful; have influenced the election somewhat merely by their presence. Due to their love of hierarchy and castes; they have increased the Supremacist leanings of one council member, and great amounts of luxury have spurred jealousy and increased the Goldwing support among another. Doubling up one symbol each.

But scientific opportunity is always calling.After defeating several of the Aristocrat warrior caste now, you have a better understanding of their morphology. The Hegemony always knew the Aristocrats must have guided their evolution; much as your species has through eugenic control, but for them they had done it so long and forcefully to completely remove innate survival instincts and add too many “luxury” adaptations that would make the Aristocrats unsuitable to survive without their technology. This was often thought to be very foolish, or the sign of a society so old and ancient that the Hegemony could never catch up to them. Given their life machine; you also thought this could be the case. But with their two others castes; Drones and Warriors; it makes more sense. Perhaps the “Glactic Society of Aristocrats” are not quite as old, ancient, or powerful as they first appeared. By offloading their evolutionary pressures onto their enviorment itself; it would stand to reason how they could modify themselves so quickly without extinction.But this great amount of genetic modification also acts as an opportunity. Studying your samples; the once-living organic ships of the warriors, their own highly-weaponized biologies, and microfauna that inhabit them; it is possible to gain a great deal of understanding into xenobiology and adapt it for our own purposes. While Aristocrats are a bit too far off (and monsterous) to insert into the Jaxtian genome directly; you could learn a thing or two about biotech from your captured sources.But the question is, what to take away from it?&gt;Semi-Organic, self repairing Spaceships (Expensive)&gt;Anti-Armor Acidic Space Weaponry&gt;Upgrade Swalli acidic spit with further chemical bioweapons&gt;Invent a “Healing Beam” to stimulate ceullar repair&gt;Enhance Fighters &amp; Smallcraft with further mobility upgrades&gt;Turn it over to Usis for his own programs"

You guess you&#039;re more like your father then you thought. But now is the time for decisive action. That&#039;s why he chose you!But now you have a tough choice to make. The Supreme Ruler already controls all the resources and full power of the Hegemony at his command; but there is a way to inspire the people to even greater heights. Loyalty and fervor are two different things, after all. You could make a vow.Many Supreme Rulers have made vows before; your Father almost did you believe, and Hass Takar did as well. The almost-divine promise of a Supreme Ruler, to vow to his people to accomplish something impossible, is the second greatest tradition among your people. With exception perhaps only to the Deathmask of Akule the Unspeakable. But making a vow is not free. To promise something, and fail to deliver this sacred promise, is to live in shame and failure for the rest of ones reign and into perpetuity. The Supreme Ruler&#039;s word is not to be given out lightly. This weight also prevents the Supreme Ruler from having more then one vow; it stands on its own.If you decide to make a vow, you can gain one additional turn for your invasion or election-rigging antics. You will gain an extra, no-strings-attached turn with no unforseen or random events besides ones already elaborated upon in the rules. But if you take this additional turn and fail that minigame, you will live in shame and infamy for the rest of your reign. You will still receive a final turn, the vow simply grants and additional one to make up for lost time or ensure you will win.&gt;Publicly VOW to make the Accord win the election and an ally in space for the future of the Hegemony&gt;Determined VOW to defeat the Aristocrats and humiliate them in your war without dragging your people through it&gt;Make no vow; for fear of failure, or out of confidence"

We saw how that turned out for the Redwings.Also, I don&#039;t know how this works, but if turning an councilor into an &#039;accord&#039; supporter eliminates one of their non-faction interests, that could also be a way to deny a voter.

I think the reaction from four or five anons by this point should sort of be ample evidence that it did, indeed, come across like a trick.IMO, players are correct to feel sandbagged sicne the mechanical cost of the vow (specifically the isolationist flip) was not previously stated, especially after “no unforeseen or random events” was promised. If your rules text lulls players into thinking a choice is purely a calculated gamble (boost vs. shame, established in several previous threads in the same quest, and you hide a twist inside it that undoes many IRL days of scheming, you should expect salt. If it wasn&#039;t an intentional gotcha, it was very much a miscommunication on your part, and the effect is pretty predictable.&gt;&gt;6278107I&#039;m inclined to stick with one because it aligns with &gt;&gt;6278086.

As a rich and powerful arms merchant, specializing in the breeding of “biological targeting rocket systems” whose Hegemonic computers can&#039;t even hack; he made many enemies by accepting payments but not delivering weapon shipments to militaries, militias, and security forces on the losing side of conflicts. After all, if they were going to lose any way, he may as well not waste the inventory and keep the payment. This, among other practices, made him hated. It&#039;s not surprised he was finally killed. Strangely though, the killers took no credit for the murder, and the two high-caliber rounds from a personal talon-gun that ended his life were much more powerful then the average Urgi personal weapons. Normally, Urgi can&#039;t handle recoil of very strong firearms, and the material technology available to a common hitman isn&#039;t enough to penetrate that many thick layers of inner ship-hull. How strange!His replacement is, through complete chance, a white bird who is a member of “the flock”, the large religious order also preaching peace and nonaggression, and a direct follower of Council Member #8.Meanwhile, YOU happen to know exactly what caused both of these events. Your spymaster, Usis Nanonae, and your team working around the clock to bring out these changes and shake up the political landscape of the Urgi. Now you must simply keep up your vow and reap the benefits of the promises you made.Suddenly, you receive a communication. Just before you could prepare your final plans for infiltration of the Urgi political system or your last attack wave. It&#039;s the Esaal&#039;s new Grand Admiral.”Jaxtians! So good to see our fellow warrior rivals again!””Let me guess, this is about that favor we owe you?””Blunt and too the point! Hahahaaha. But I was thinking, maybe we Esaal should start doing that honorific stuff. You go by “your Majesty”, right? What should the great Esaal admiral go by?””...””Your ruthlessness? Your killeriest? Your badassness? Oh, maybe just “the terrible”?! What do you think?””I think, uhh, you&#039;d know your culture better then mine... Brave one?””Ohhh! I like that, oh ho ho!”Still beaming with pride and a bit of ego, much like yourself when you ascended, you figure this Esaal probably just got promoted. He&#039;s pretty young for the position too; the Esaal only ascend people to the highest ranks based on merit and achievement. You wonder if their culture is changing closer to yours over the years? Imitation being the most sincere form of flattery?"

Perhaps he was just a bit starstruck talking to the Supreme Ruler reknowned for being a skilled duelist and warrior. And for beating up the Aristocrats so soundly in a fraction of the time it took the Esaal to do it.”Well... yes then. I&#039;ll be brief. The Casliaans, one of our subject races, are people we have fought many, many, many, many times now. We love fighting them! But recently, it has gotten too much with them sneaking away as refugees or joining pirates and raiding and all of this... the womenfolk especially don&#039;t like their predations when let loose among the Esaal&#039;s softer, inner society. Too scared to fight us man on man anymore, HUH!?” He growls at the display in front of him, showing a Casliaan warrior rebel.The Threemind whispers context in your ear. “It&#039;s highly likely the Casliaans adapted to favor hit and run tactics, even evolutionarily, as the warriors who fought head on were selected against in the genome.

Something that can scan and tell the difference between a sack of fruit and a cowardly little Casliaan stowaway! The truth is, we LOVE fighting them! They&#039;re the reason we have to keep inventing new weapons year after year! But... it&#039;s become tiresome. We&#039;d like to spend some time fighting other people and keep the Casliaans from scurrying away and fighting in ways we don&#039;t like. You could do this for us, oh great leader of the Jaxtians. Your computer technology and AI is way better. We just need a strong sorting algorithim. Just like our battle maps and Aristocrat fleet info my predesccesor gave you! It&#039;s a fair trade, data for data, a favor for a favor. So, can you send it over?”The Threemind whispers again, this time more carefully. “Your Majesty, the Casliaan Homeworld is deep in Esaal territory, and is their most common fought rival in space. With the sort of thing we can give them, escape and rebel actions against their occupieres, the Esaal, will be almost impossible. In other words, we will make the Casliaans totally helpless against the Esaal. They will keep them locked up on their homeworld forever; unable to escape into deep space and gain independence like many other species have done.””Like what we did to the Swall.”“Precisely. But the Casliaans have some members in the galactic underground, and now, they will be a minority of a minority. It is highly likely they won&#039;t have the numbers to reproduce successfully and will die out; leaving the Casliaans stuck to their homeworld forever. An easy target for extermination.””We have comitted genocide before, I have very little qualms with giving the Esaal to keys to another species fate.”“True. But don&#039;t forget of the Casliaans on the council. They will likely not take this news well and will likely want to militarize in response. Unless they know of our connection to the Accord, in which case, they&#039;ll probably just vote against the Accord no matter what...”The Esaal smiles at the camera and the data feed. ”Well, honorable Jaxtians? Are you ready to give us what you promised?”&gt;Give him what he wants (Casliaans on the Council angered)&gt;Apologize but give him your father&#039;s expansion fund of Consortium Credits as a compromise (Expensive)&gt;Deny him his request&gt;Refuse and promise to help fight for Casliaan freedom (Lose -100 Fleet Power on your next invasion to protect against Esaal attack)"

The leader has to have some special quality about him. It doesn&#039;t matter much what, but he became the leader for a reason after all.The goal is the overarching vision of your civilization. Usually is something tied to expansion, conquest, knowledge, innovation, cultural or religious goals, militaristic goals, political goals or mere survival.Gods could have that greek flavor of showing up uninvited, could be absent from the world but still influence in subtle ways, could have totally vanished or never existed outside men&#039;s imagination, or anything else you can think of, just describe it properly.The easiest types of magic to run are vancian fire and forget type of thing, or some overland ritual magic that takes massive amounts of resources like in master of magic. But if you want some bizarre shit like in mage ascension, power creep (starts really shitty but becomes overpowered) or something subtle like synchronicities and schizophrenia, then just say the word.I plan to run long sessions, and when I can&#039;t run sessions I&#039;ll drop an update saying &quot;today there is no session&quot;.I might use AI slop for images, like this one, cause I&#039;m no drawfag.

She chose neither, retreating into silence and, ultimately, death. But now, her relic has resurfaced-a single white feather encased in amber, glowing with her final breath.Each god claims it. Each demands it. Neither will yield.The Gods:Mithrak, God of Vengeance and Oaths, carries a massive bronze blade wreathed in fire. He claims Elhira loved him truly, but was taken from him by deception. He is the guardian of the betrayed and the enforcer of binding vows.Neruk, God of Silence and Secrets, wields a black staff that swallows light and truth. He says Elhira confided in him alone, and he alone understood her sorrow. He is the keeper of forgotten things and the unspoken heart.You stand between them now, the relic sealed by layers of both their magic, the sky heavy with waiting.What do you propose? (one or more gods might be angered by your choices)&gt; Trial by Combat - Let them finish their duel. The last standing takes the relic.&gt; Judgment by the Mortal Heart – You decide who loved her truly, and who she truly loved.&gt; Divide the Relic – Cut the relic in two. Share the loss and the power.&gt; Awaken Elhira – Use the relic and divine blood to summon her spirit. Let her speak for herself.&gt; Cast the Relic Into the Mortal World – Bury it in mystery, and let fate decide.&gt; Bind It With an Oath – Forge a pact: neither may touch it until peace is sworn.&gt; Write in"

Your people surge toward the doors like a tide-but you are already there.And when the demon reaches the threshold-You shove it back inside.It stumbles, cursing in your voice. You leap after it, fists flying, slamming blow after blow into its face.

Fire races across the floor.You grab the demon by the face and drive it toward the blaze.The flames lick its skin.And the glamour fails.Its flesh bubbles and peels, revealing slick, red-black skin stretched too tightly over a snarling face, blood pouring forth. Eyes like boiled fat glare at you as horns burst from its skull. “There you are,” you whisper.The demon snarls, now fully revealed-but stronger. It throws you off with a roar, your body hitting the dirt hard.You draw your sword, breath ragged.The demon sneers, its form smoking in the firelight. “Your tribe’s magic is pitiful. You can do nothing against me.”But the longhouse groans. A pillar collapses. The roof begins to cave in.The demon glances upward. “We will meet again,” it growls-and vanishes into the night like smoke.You stumble outside, coughing, bleeding.The longhouse collapses in flames, and your people fall to their knees, crying. None of them know why. Their minds reel. Their hearts ache.They grieve for a joy they now realize was hollow. For something they cannot name.And you watch it all burn.You say nothing.The next morning you learn the grim truth - the demon was eating the tribe&#039;s children!

The plan involved spending a lot of time with him, drilling your current weak points, and it&#039;s not that you thought it was a bad plan. It was a reasonable plan, and he said it all reasonably, like he&#039;d been doing— he&#039;d been reasonable ever since you learned he killed your father. You couldn&#039;t tolerate it. You&#039;d been tolerating it, admirably well, you thought, since you&#039;d kill him later. Your father would be avenged, later. But it had been weeks, later was nowhere in sight, and Henry had picked the scab off the wound. Now when you thought of your father, Henry&#039;s voice in your head went He wanted more than anything to be good for your sake.

Staying over. I told her she could go back any time, but she—You weren&#039;t worried. You explained, minus the part about tearing Richard limb to limb in a snake pit the size of the world, and Henry said: Well, about time, kiddo. If this is how it has to be, I&#039;d love to help.A few weeks ago this would&#039;ve made you nervous. But Henry didn&#039;t kill your father, and Henry likes you, and Henry knows you, even if you don&#039;t know him. You think he&#039;d be sad if he found out you forgot him, and your father, so you won&#039;t tell him. He hasn&#039;t done anything to deserve that.Henry gave you directions— told you he could get you straight there, actually, but you asked if he could bring your worm straight there, and he didn&#039;t have a good answer for that. You let Annie dig a tunnel instead. You think she&#039;s happy digging tunnels, second only to when she&#039;s eating people. It&#039;s nice being back around somebody with uncomplicated motives.It&#039;s possible Henry thought you were kidding about the worm, from his reaction when Annie busts through the floor. It&#039;s smoothed over quickly.Claudia is excited to see you and doesn&#039;t remember to be nonchalant until almost ten minutes later. She shows you her new closed-spiral tattoo, smoothly printed over the old raggedy homemade one. &quot;This would&#039;ve made the liaisons shit their pants!&quot;You tell her you like her tattoo, even if your mental Aunt Ruby&#039;s having a conniption. Claudia beams and asks if your worm bites. Only if I say so, you say. She beams harder.Later, you recount to Henry what you remember of Richard&#039;s lecture. (Surprisingly a lot. The acting-out helped.) Henry starts off the conversation upright and ends it with his cheek in his hand. &quot;God below.&quot;&quot;Is that bad?&quot; you say. &quot;You can&#039;t help? Because if you can&#039;t help—&quot;&quot;Didn&#039;t say that. I just, eh... you would be considered very advanced already, by common standards. The Wyrm is sparing in Its favors. It&#039;s disturbing that you need to push so much further, and I— I worry, kiddo, that you&#039;re going to all this grief for—&quot;You don&#039;t want to hear it. &quot;I need a chance, don&#039;t I? And I need to chop Jean Ramsey&#039;s head off before I even touch the Wyrm, and she&#039;s— who knows what kind of awful stuff she&#039;s up to. So we&#039;re doing it. Tell me you can help.&quot;&quot;The indomitable Lottie Fawkins.&quot; Henry smiles pensively. &quot;I can help. You&#039;ll be speeding past me on the Road, but this old dog can teach a few good tricks regardless. Do you think C.R. is asleep by now?&quot;—Claudia is asleep enough to puddle. The Herald appeared in your dreams, and you are the Herald, so you should be able to appear in other people&#039;s dreams— right? She&#039;s dreaming right now. You could just commune with her. That seems way too simple. You glance at Henry. &quot;Do I just...?&quot;&quot;Whatever your instincts are, I predict they&#039;re the right ones.&quot;(2/a lot)"

        "text": "So much for teaching. You creep forward, acutely aware that you&#039;ll be getting an earful if she wakes, and rest your fingertips on her gummy forehead. You&#039;d normally look in her eyes, but they&#039;re closed, maybe sutured closed. Whatever. You shut your own eyes and see her fluttering strings, your hot bright core— what did Richard call communion once? Commingling? Press your hot bright fingers deeper— ignore her mumbling, or you&#039;ll feel bad— and let her strings wrap themselves around you, and feel something, and focus very hard on feeling that something more. In and through. Come on now. You&#039;ve done it before.In and through until you slip weightless through gauze and are suffocating. You are wet and it is cold and clinging and you are immobilized and choking on blue. Not drowning. You did that already. And not dying, not really, because you can&#039;t do that. Positive thinking. You aren&#039;t where you were, meaning you must be dreaming. Meaning you can be anywhere, and you aren&#039;t choking on anything, and so you aren&#039;t. You are pleased with your perspicacity. When you said dreaming, you meant you were participating in a dream. This is Claudia&#039;s dream, and the goo is her invention— unlimited guesses where she got that from. You doubt she knows she&#039;s dreaming. If she knows anything, she knows that she&#039;s dying, maybe dissolving, or dead already. An ordinary search would take hours or days. The goo is uncaring, featureless, and more opaque than it isn&#039;t. You&#039;d have to dig crisscrossing tunnels. But you think about the Herald appearing, disappearing, and say, out loud, &quot;Claudia.&quot; And then she&#039;s there, or else you&#039;re where she is, and she&#039;s a dark smudge in the blue, and you have to scrape huge wobbling chunks away to even see her face— eyes open, bulging, unblinking. When you yank her out, she gargles and hacks blue down your misty front. You hold her as she does, even though you don&#039;t know her. Even though she&#039;s rarely very pleasant. You hold her because she doesn&#039;t have parents either.Still, you&#039;re disconcerted when she raises glazed eyes to your face and says, tremulously, &quot;Mom?&quot;, and even more disconcerted when your body, such as it is, begins to ripple into not-your-body. Claudia hugs you and sobs into not-your-chest and you don&#039;t know what to do— leave her? But you&#039;re not—There&#039;s a sharp tug at the small of your back, and you&#039;re tugged with it, pulled cleanly free of the woman Claudia clings to.

That seems more useful.&quot;&quot;You&#039;d always need to be there, one way or another. I don&#039;t know any way to do it without getting up off your ass. Doesn&#039;t mean you need to walk there, though.&quot; Henry surveys you. &quot;You fell through the seal.&quot;The seal? The— oh, right. &quot;Um, yes.&quot;&quot;Your body didn&#039;t. That&#039;s solid stone. You did.&quot;You were using your Earth Powers. &quot;...Yes.&quot;&quot;Extrapolate, kiddo.&quot;You can leave your body and wander off to mess with other people&#039;s heads? That sounds dangerous— if you ran into somebody able to see strings, you&#039;d be entirely unprotected. Richard wouldn&#039;t approve. You have to try it. &quot;Can you do that? You— wait.&quot; When you were buried alive, he was watching you, somehow. &quot;You can do that.&quot;&quot;Can&#039;t say the occasion arises very often, but yes. Do you need tips?&quot; You bet Richard could yank you out of your body on demand, if you asked. You&#039;re not asking. &quot;...Sure.&quot;&quot;Alright. Let&#039;s get out of here first, don&#039;t you think? Leave her be.&quot;Claudia is exactly where she was, deaf to you. The woman hasn&#039;t moved either. You pace softly around the two of them and glimpse the woman&#039;s face: it isn&#039;t there. It&#039;s all a blur. You pace back and nod. Henry pulls a hazy knife from his belt, takes your palm, winks at you, and stabs it. The blade passes clean through, until it doesn&#039;t, and you—Ow!—wake. You are on the floor. Your hand is slick with goo. Your palm stings. As you push yourself up, you hear shuffling, and Henry comes around to help you up. He puts a finger to his lips. Claudia is still fast asleep, and you leave her be.———You decide to spend the night. Richard, sulkily silent, doesn&#039;t object. When the day comes, you stick around. Claudia pets Annie. You show Henry The Sword— &quot;Wyrmbite,&quot; he says, and holds it for a long time, before handing it back and ruffling your hair. You ask if you can train with with him, and he laughs. &quot;And throw my back out?&quot;Apparently not, but Henry goes off to talk to the other cultists and comes back with a beefy guy named Dale, who looks glancingly familiar— maybe he was helping out with Headspace? Maybe he lives in town somewhere? You don&#039;t ask. You do accept his handshake.(4/a lot)"

Dale is dark-haired, and if you squint you can pretend it&#039;s Richard&#039;s new body you&#039;re whaling on. Okay, maybe not &#039;whaling on.&#039; Dale is more agile than you thought, or maybe you&#039;re less, though when he tries to sweep your feet you don&#039;t even wobble. You pay him back with a thwack across his shoulderblades, and continue, back and forth, until you&#039;re sweaty and battered and can only think about lemonade. You&#039;re not even thirsty, not exactly, but thinking about a cold lemonade... Richard...«Get your own.»Really cranky. Why? You told him you&#039;d kill him from the start. Whatever. You shake hands with Dale, who holds his smarting knee and insists on giving you pointers on your sword grip before he goes. Later than that, you drink something Henry gives you, which stops your heart, and you die. In his defense, he told you it wasn&#039;t lemonade (&quot;sorry, kiddo&quot;). And you don&#039;t think your heart is actually stopped. It might just be really slow. But you look super dead from the outside, Claudia will tell you later, with no small amount of glee.In any case, it&#039;s easier to slip out of your body if your heart isn&#039;t in it, and pretty soon you&#039;re underground.

This is complicated by the fact that your experimentation the night before has doubled your physical weight (though not your mass), meaning Richard has to do the walking. Eventually you make it to Hellsbells, where you pass out.You dream of being infested by insects and unable to do anything about it. When you awaken, Gil, Claudia, and Earl are gone, so you spend the day experimenting with your earth powers. When you return, you have drinks with the group, which is fun for you and miserable for Claudia-- now made of goo, she gets insta-drunk and bursts into tears. You do your best to comfort her.It is now Day 9 of exile, Richard has improved your musculature, and you&#039;ve gone to check in on Ellery-- and Us, who wants to know how Claudia is doing. After telling them (and leaving out the &quot;got too drunk&quot; part), you say hi to Ellery and Anthea, who&#039;s also visiting. Ellery has told Anthea about the God thing: she&#039;s a little too excited, and invites you to the next Spelunker&#039;s Associated meeting. You get some tests run on you for the mind-duplication device, then convince Ellery to help explode you and boost your sun powers. Despite Richard&#039;s skepticism, you do in fact get exploded, and it does help.On Day 10, you arrange a meet-up with Madrigal, who trades info on Branwen (she&#039;s fine, probably) and Monty (he did tell Madrigal about his dark past; Madrigal wasn&#039;t sure what the big deal was) for your updates about Ellery. She also lets you know that an increasingly irritable Lucky is still on the hunt. That night, Richard, in lieu of more drugs, tests out throwing you into the font in your manse. You dissolve in the warm water, but are awakened by your alarm bird and have some dreamy revelations about your role in things.Then you dream, for real, about being imprisoned in mud and unable to do anything about it. When you awaken, it&#039;s Night 11: you slept through the day. You enlist Earl in helping invoke your red stuff, this time turning your whole arm monstrous and scaly. Claudia is excited; Teddy (who&#039;s temporarily possessed Gil) is less so, but helps restore it to normal. Earl reiterates Anthea&#039;s invitation to the Spelunker&#039;s Associated meeting tomorrow."

With the power of your heroic spirit (and Richard&#039;s genuine interest in puzzle-solving), as well as the power of Gil tanking all the traps on your behalf, you make it through... only to explode Gil and Claudia at the very last moment. It&#039;s fine! They&#039;re made of goo. With Anthea&#039;s help, you haul them and a commemorative trophy home: you install the trophy in your manse for moral support.On Day 14, Gil reveals that he&#039;s successfully attained control over his blessing, gives you a tour of his significantly jazzed-up manse, and teaches you and Claudia the basics of legerdemain. On Night 14, Arledge-- Eloise&#039;s acquaintance, the one you explored Us with-- shows up. Apparently he&#039;s Earl&#039;s close friend, but Earl wasn&#039;t expecting him, and Arledge wasn&#039;t expecting you. Given his loathing of Lucky, you admit that you&#039;re on the run and explain the whole Wind Court / Management / Jean Ramsey situation. Arledge is curiously unsurprised: apparently he&#039;s been on the Wind Court&#039;s tail for years, trying to uncover their leaders&#039; connection to the Wyrm. He seems to think that they&#039;ve been after the Crown to summon the Wyrm deliberately, and that Lucky&#039;s been tasked to arrest you, not because of your crimes, but because you&#039;re wanted for your role in the ritual. You&#039;re not sure about that-- it seems to you that Jean Ramsey could&#039;ve easily requested your arrest to get you out of the way-- but the general point stands: the Wind Court is Wyrm-corrupted, and Lucky has no idea.You propose telling him-- maybe he&#039;ll be on your side?-- but Arledge, who has extensive dealings with Lucky, doubts that it&#039;ll work: Lucky&#039;s just too dogmatic. You ignore him and resolve to tell Lucky. In the meantime, you get Arledge to supervise your pagan experimentation, and successfully 1. transform into a big red lizard and 2. don&#039;t eat anybody. You&#039;re pleased, but wish your Lizard Forme were a little cooler-looking. Maybe next time.That night, Richard sets about mucking with your strings directly, and you fall out of the world again. After another premonition, you witness the eye of the Wyrm, then have another strange dream-- this time of &quot;offspring&quot; and slaves.&quot;On Day 16-- you slept for nearly 24 hours-- you let Gil know that you&#039;re heading off to talk to Lucky. After all, you saw it in your premonition. Jumping down on Lucky from a tree doesn&#039;t go well, but you recover swiftly, Advanced Gaslighting Lucky into submission. He isn&#039;t exactly pleased about it, and doesn&#039;t promise his help, but lets you go. You are officially not in danger of being arrested!"

After greeting everybody and negotiating Claudia a stay in Horse Face&#039;s empty tent, you settle down, only to be interrupted: Henry is at your door. He heard that you were back in town, and he wants to catch up. You begrudgingly tell him the whole story. He&#039;s unsurprised that Richard killed your father, but shocked, and concerned, about your Wyrm plan: he doesn&#039;t seem to think you&#039;ll be able to contain it, no matter how much you prepare. Caught off-balance by his doubt and the talk of your father, you begin to cry, then can&#039;t stop. Richard has to knock you out of it. You introduce Henry to Claudia.Later, Richard wants to know more about the dreams you&#039;ve been having-- you told Henry about him, but not him. You deduce that they seem to be from the perspective of the Wyrm, but Richard is cagey about further significance. He wants to lecture at you about your current progress, and you generously allow him to, then put the pieces together: your dreams contradict what Richard told you about the origin of the agents. He told you that the sea gods banished them to Satellite, but your dreams suggest that the Wyrm did that. And if the Wyrm banished them, is it really likely it&#039;ll want to bring them back? If you can convince the agents of that, won&#039;t they halt their Wyrm-summoning plans? Richard doesn&#039;t agree, but you pressure him into making arrangements: you will visit Satellite, and you will speak to the Director yourself. Nothing can possibly go wrong!You spend the next couple days bringing Annie, your beloved man-eating worm, back to life. Gil, your beloved retainer, comes along for the ride. During a vulnerable moment, he admits how much he admires you, and how much he feels he owes you, and you admit you think you owe him. In fact, he might be more than just a retainer. He might be your.......... friend.Annie resurrected, you make plans for the next couple days..."

I— I— you said I&#039;m going to be God. Definitely. And if I&#039;m God, everybody in the world will know who I am. So shouldn&#039;t I get started now? Nobody else will— you don&#039;t think Jean Ramsey will have a tail, will she?&quot;&quot;If Dickface catches wind, I imagine she&#039;ll have six, but don&#039;t let that stop you.&quot;&quot;Because mine will be better.&quot;Richard&#039;s mouth quirks. &quot;I can see what I can do.

I seem to recall you insisting that you never, ever wanted to turn into a lizard, and if I dared to turn you into a lizard, you would—&quot;&quot;Well, then I did turn into one, and I remembered that I already did it a lot of times. So it wasn&#039;t so bad. It&#039;s only bad when I&#039;m— when I&#039;m not in charge of it, and if I tell you to do it, I am in charge. You should do lizard horns, by the way.&quot;&quot;Horns?&quot;You brace your hands above your ears and point four fingers backwards. &quot;The Herald has horns. I&#039;m positive. You should make them white, and not too pointy, because the Herald&#039;s aren&#039;t pointy. Also, so they match my outfits. But you need to make sure I can still wear the Crown with them on, or else— hey!&quot;Richard is snickering, which always could be malicious, coming from him, but he doesn&#039;t look all that malice-filled. He has raised his fist to his mouth to try and hide it. You slowly lower your fingers. &quot;I&#039;m serious.&quot;&quot;I— yes. Ehm.&quot; He wipes his mouth. &quot;Of course. I am also serious, Charlotte. Horns are simpler, but the extra weight must be factored in— I don&#039;t intend on straining your neck— and, yes, the Crown must, eh—&quot;He has raised, reflexively, four fingers to his temple, and now that he&#039;s doing it you admit it looks a little ridiculous. You try not to catch his eye, in case you&#039;ll laugh, and screw your face up, so it doesn&#039;t show. Unfortunately, your pure and honest heart exposes everything, because Richard laughs at you more and you have no choice but to laugh a little back.But no more than that, because he killed your father. He killed your father in cold blood and replaced him and lied to you and he doesn&#039;t get to be anything other than raw evil ever again. You snap your mouth shut and stare at his. &quot;You need to go back to being a snake.&quot;Richard&#039;s mouth inverts, then presses inward.

From Richard, a sharp inhale, then nothing, then a mild staticky buzz. «That&#039;s over with, then.

You are flung out of control, and could take it back— you are almost positive you could surprise him and take it back. You are glad instead when a pillow is shoved over your face. You sleep.—Your sleep is unsettled and your dreams are snippets. You suffer fleeting cramps and spasms. Once, you awake to yourself upright, talking; once or twice more you sense movement, or hear jumbled conversations, but you don&#039;t know whether they&#039;re real. Overwhelmingly you are paralyzed, and overall there is heat and discomfort up your spine. And on your stomach, though it&#039;s cold there.«Awaken.»No, that&#039;s just the snake. You are lying on your back, painfully, in a tiny sealed room: not quite a coffin, but closer than not. Your sleeves have been pulled back, and spirals are painted up and down your arms. Your face feels sticky, so maybe it&#039;s painted, too. Besides you and Richard in the room— he isn&#039;t painted, but if you get your hands on him he will be— there&#039;s a crinkly snakeskin underneath you and a bloodied dagger lying by your hand. Bloodied? Boy, you hope that&#039;s paint.You sit up, shoving Richard off of you, which causes your spine to sting more— and your tailbone— and your head. Did you hit your head? You have a nasty welt on your scalp. You have... two... nasty welts.You eye Richard.«Yes.»Horns.«Eventually. Don&#039;t oversell it.»Horns. You feel sick in a bad way and a good way and don&#039;t know which wins out. Horns. Eventually. On your actual head, forever, or as long as you have one. What about the rest? You twist to see and feel your back: it doesn&#039;t look all that different, except for the ever-encroaching scales, but when you run your hand down your spine it feels a little bumpier than usual. When you run it all the way down, toward the pressure point at your tailbone, there&#039;s a bump there too. It&#039;s marginally bumpier than all the rest.«Yes.»Okay. You guess that&#039;s why the tailbone&#039;s called that. But nobody would ever recognize it— if they were even looking, which would be extremely rude— so you pull your hand away and try to pretend you found nothing. Your heart is hammering.

        "text": "&gt;Good endingYou have to have a plan. You can&#039;t look like you haven&#039;t thought this through. You&#039;ll have to— you&#039;ll— you&#039;re going to make things better. You&#039;re going to ban Management. That&#039;s easy. No more Management. In fact, you&#039;ll ban murder. And crime. And poor people. You probably shouldn&#039;t ban dying, though, or people you don&#039;t like will stick around forever— but maybe you can invent hell for them? If it doesn&#039;t exist already? Would that be evil? Maybe you better stick to nice rewards instead, like— if somebody you like dies, you can make them happy forever. You can put them in the happy dimension. Like Us, but not weird and gross. Would that work better?You think that would work better, but that&#039;s not good enough for Lucky, you&#039;re positive. No way he trusts you to make decisions like that. You should tell him about something else, like making magyck real. Couldn&#039;t you do that? Give Richard one last up-yours and let people shoot fire out of their hands? The world could be fun again, and exciting, and heroes could roam the land— heroes not named Charlotte Fawkins. You could give them monsters to slay. Lucky probably wouldn&#039;t like that either. What if you told him you&#039;d make dry land? Real land? You&#039;d have to fix the people underwater, so they could go back to breathing air, and fix the animals too— and the fish wouldn&#039;t like it very much— but you wouldn&#039;t get rid of the whole ocean, just some of it. Lucky would almost certainly approve of that plan.But when you try to say it, your pure and honest heart fails you. It&#039;s not a lie to say you&#039;ll bring back dry land, it&#039;s not a lie to say you&#039;ll fix the world, it&#039;s not a lie to say you&#039;ll be God— you fully believe it, can&#039;t not, at this point, believe it— but it&#039;s a lie to say you know how. You&#039;ll know someday, but not now. Not even close. On the surface, Lucky&#039;s expression has hardly shifted, but there&#039;s something glimmering in his eyes. One thing you know for sure right now: you have to get off this topic. &quot;I— I&#039;ll fix everything, okay? I&#039;ll make it right. You don&#039;t need to worry about it.&quot;&quot;Whatever you say, Ms. Fawkins.&quot; He&#039;s moving to stand. &quot;I think it&#039;s best you leave for now. You&#039;ll hear from me if and exclusively if I have something to say to you. Understood?&quot;You said you&#039;d put him back on his Pillar, but you could still smite him after. You never promised to not smite him after. &quot;...Yes.&quot;&quot;Wonderful. Goodbye, then.&quot;—————————&quot;What I&#039;d do if I could do anything?&quot;You&#039;re already regretting asking Real Ellery. &quot;...If that&#039;s what I said.&quot;&quot;Well, it was, so I guess the answer is— hey, Thea, you know this one.&quot; He swivels to face Anthea. &quot;I&#039;d go bugfuck crazy. Hope that helps.&quot;You&#039;re regretting visiting in general, honestly. He&#039;s in a strange temper, and him and Anthea keep touching each other. Too late now. &quot;Okay, but you couldn&#039;t actually do anything at all. You just imagined you could. Also, I won&#039;t go crazy, since I&#039;m better than you.&quot;&quot;Uh-huh.&quot;(1/4?)"

As far as we know, they knew what they were doing. Do you?&quot;&quot;Of course I will,&quot; you say. &quot;And I&#039;m not doing that. Something else.&quot;&quot;Okay, fine. Then I&#039;d probably blast the Pillars down. See how all those sky-high assholes like being on an even— oh, sorry, you&#039;re a rich bitch, aren&#039;t you?

Not the ones you— not the ones you took care of, Charlotte, but their doubles. The ones with locitis? As far as we know, they&#039;re still out there, with, um, varying levels of functionality, and there&#039;s not a whole lot we can do. I&#039;m having the Collective look into it, but, um... yeah. Madrigal was helping out the other day, actually. She brought in...&quot;Anthea&#039;s smoke goes green-blueish. Ellery&#039;s face sets. You rapidly detectivate. &quot;Fake Ellery was here?&quot;&quot;Don&#039;t call him that.&quot;&quot;I&#039;m not calling him whatever you call him. Did you shoot him?&quot;A long silence. He swivels the chair back and forth. &quot;No. We had a productive conversation.&quot;Well, that explains the mood. &quot;Would he have better ideas for what to do with God powers than you do?&quot;&quot;Worse ones.&quot; (You contemplate. That&#039;s almost certainly true.) &quot;I came up with a good one, though. Why don&#039;t you fix Thea&#039;s face?&quot;Anthea swats him. &quot;I&#039;m fine! I don&#039;t need anything.&quot;&quot;She&#039;s not fine, Charlotte. And it was my fault, so, you know, use my wish on that.&quot;&quot;It was not his fault. It was an accident.&quot;&quot;It was my accident, and I know it fucked up your face, Thea. Just because I haven&#039;t seen it— seriously, Charlotte, add it to the list. It shouldn&#039;t be tough for God.&quot;&quot;Maybe.&quot; But his sentence made no sense. &quot;You haven&#039;t seen it?&quot;&quot;He hasn&#039;t been out to see me in person. You haven&#039;t either, have you, Charlotte? It&#039;s really nothing. I just can&#039;t move it.&quot; Anthea waves her hand through her smoke. &quot;Help the doubles, won&#039;t you? At least help Ellery&#039;s. I don&#039;t think he really deserved anything that happened... not that Ell deserved it either, but at least he knew.&quot;&quot;Yeah. I agree. There only needs to be one of us, Charlotte, and—&quot; Anthea swats him again. &quot;We&#039;ve talked about this. You know what you owe me.&quot;&quot;I&#039;ll think about it,&quot; you say uncomfortably. &quot;Can we go suck my blood out already?&quot;(2/4?)"

        "text": "For you, it&#039;s been just under a month since you blew up Headspace. For Real Ellery, and indeed all the absorbed employees, it&#039;s been over half a year— which goes a ways toward explaining why the bloom&#039;s come off the rose, and how Ellery is able to, very casually, melt and reform you elsewhere. Your blood is sampled by a team of silent, stone-faced employees— you side-eye Ellery, the only one obviously conscious. &quot;Are they...?&quot;&quot;They&#039;re fine. Hey, guys. Hey, Angelo. Hey, Shirley. Wes. Look alive. You&#039;re freaking her out.&quot;Angelo, Shirley, and Wes snap to it, are all abuzz and apologetic, introduce themselves, whatever— you didn&#039;t actually care, you just didn&#039;t know if they were dead. They&#039;re not, says Ellery (even as, your attention off them, the three grow silent again): they&#039;re just, you know, up there. In Headspace. Nice scales, by the way.Your sleeve got rolled up. Thanks, you say. Aren&#039;t we all in...?You aren&#039;t, and Ellery isn&#039;t, except when he, by way of demonstration, rolls his eyes up into his skull— rather than the clean separation of Us&#039;s dream-world, the hive-mind here is more fluid and more voluntary. Dip in for eerie efficiency, dip out for privacy, or at least perceived privacy. It makes sense when he says it, mostly, except that every employee you passed by this trip was scary and vacant.&quot;Yeah. Well... the more they all get used to it...&quot; Ellery, back to you, is swirling your blood in a swirly machine. &quot;...the more it&#039;s the default. It&#039;s pretty fun up there. Low stress.&quot;&quot;Shouldn&#039;t you be busy, um, destressing?&quot; Even when you first showed up, he didn&#039;t have to snap out of anything. &quot;Can&#039;t. I mean, I can tap in, but I&#039;m never a &#039;we.&#039; You know. Same deal with the trances and all that. Management&#039;s project: successful.&quot; He sounds bitter. &quot;You know your blood sparkles, by the way?&quot;You spring from your seat. &quot;It what?&quot;It sparkles: Ellery shows you an unswirled vial, which looks like blood with glitter in, and a swirled one, which shows distinct layers of blood (red bit, white bit, yellow bit) and glitter (clear bit). &quot;...That&#039;s not normal?&quot;&quot;It&#039;s ridiculous. That stuff—&quot; He taps the glitter with his tweezers. &quot;—is chit. Fucking chit in your blood, Charlotte. My best guess is, you&#039;re loaded with so much Law, it&#039;s literally crystalizing. My other best guess is your fucking Manager&#039;s responsible. Do I have that right?&quot;&quot;He has a name,&quot; you say. &quot;And he says— well, yeah. He says I&#039;m super-duper real. Realer than real. Which I don&#039;t think is a normal thing you can be, but I&#039;m going to be God, so—&quot;&quot;You&#039;re fucking extrareal?&quot;&quot;...Yes? Wait, like glass?&quot;&quot;Yes, like glass. Maybe. That&#039;s... I&#039;d like to double-check that one, because seriously, what the fuck. Shirley, could you—&quot;(3/4?)"

He shakes his head more when you ask if you can get more extrareal, but doesn&#039;t actually mean &quot;no.&quot; He means &quot;I guess we&#039;ll look into it.&quot;Which is why you come back the next day, and the day after— on one occasion you bring Claudia and drop her off with Us for the afternoon, which isn&#039;t difficult, because an official channel&#039;s been opened between the two goo-things. Us cloistered off its main &quot;dream,&quot; wary of it being polluted by 5,000 newcomers— you wouldn&#039;t have anything to do with that, of course— but opened a discreet antechamber to share news and do business in. This antechamber is popular with the forward-thinking dead, the curious living, and Anthea, who&#039;s been thrilled to have a firsthand source for her historiographies. (She tells you this. You don&#039;t know what a &quot;historiography&quot; is, but you&#039;re glad she&#039;s happy.) Claudia is nervous when you leave (but rolls her eyes when you ask if she doesn&#039;t want to be there), and quiet when you return, sore and pale from vigorous testing. You ask if she&#039;s okay, and she says yeah. You ask if she wants to return to Us, and she says no. You ask if she had a good reunion; she delivers a protracted, indiscernable look and shrugs. YES, Us says. THANK YOU FOR YOUR KINDNESS. IT WAS GOOD.Meanwhile, you become marginally extrarealer, according to Ellery; neither you nor he really have any idea what that means, and the snake (Richard is still sulking) is unhelpful. You also take another plunge in the pressure chamber, meaning Ellery is the first person ever to see you with a tail. It doesn&#039;t count, since it&#039;s fake and imaginary and manse-induced and nothing like the real one you will definitely probably eventually have, and you don&#039;t like looking at it, or touching it, and you really don&#039;t like that Ellery keeps smirking, even when you tell him to stop smirking. When he continues to not stop, you slice his paper chest open and make all his goo leak out, which serves as a useful distraction. (&quot;Okay, very funny,&quot; says the puddle under you.) With Ellery incapacitated, you rip the sun out of your own chest, stone or no. You don&#039;t need his help.(4/5)"

If it all goes right, won&#039;t your problems be solved? And if it all goes wrong, they&#039;ll kill Richard before you have the chance to. You can&#039;t let that happen.The trouble is, to not let that happen, you have to actually talk to Richard. Snake Richard. You get him sulking— you do plenty of sulking— but it&#039;s been days, and whenever you force him out of it, he glares at you over his glasses and crushes his bones into glue right back over again. Does he get some sick satisfaction from it? Is it helping him focus? Is he under scrutiny— so much scrutiny he can&#039;t tell you he is?The snake won&#039;t answer your questions, because it doesn&#039;t do that. It can&#039;t. You can&#039;t even muster the energy to hate it, now that you know the truth— it calls you a stupid bitch and you imagine a typewriter doing it, imagine a radio, imagine Richard at his snake desk drooling on his sleeve. If it attempts anything more specific, those don&#039;t work either. It can&#039;t say you&#039;re useless, because you&#039;re going to save the world. It can&#039;t say you&#039;re powerless, because you&#039;re going to be God. It can&#039;t call you friendless, because— because you aren&#039;t. You demonstrably aren&#039;t.And it can&#039;t hurt you, either. You mean, it can, but— you goad it one time, just to see, and it won&#039;t even go all the way up the pain scale. It&#039;s supremely annoying to the snake when you rate things using the pain scale, even though he invented it for you, and even more annoying when you grit your teeth, stand back up, and whap his snaky body across the room. (You have not yet achieved divine levels of forgiveness.) It&#039;s all rather silly, considering that you&#039;re making objective progress toward its one and only goal, but maybe Richard tweaked it to be extra-bitter. Just to show you. Well, whatever. You&#039;re showed. You don&#039;t want to murder Richard any less, if that&#039;s what he was hoping for, but you&#039;d like to make it through the next few days (weeks? months?) without actively plotting the details.&quot;I&#039;m not going to apologize,&quot; you inform him.You are in his manse, where he can&#039;t wriggle out of this. He is in a sweater, possibly also to show you. &quot;Did I say anything about apologizing, Charlotte?&quot;&quot;No, and you shouldn&#039;t, because I didn&#039;t do anything wrong. I just— I think you should apologize first, if anybody should apologize.&quot; You wait for him to apologize. He doesn&#039;t. &quot;But maybe nobody— how are you doing with Satellite? I deserve to know.&quot;&quot;It&#039;s not relevant how I&#039;m doing right now. It&#039;s relevant to know when or if I&#039;ll finish, which I don&#039;t know at all.

To simplistically resummarize the theory behind this, Charlotte, I am in your mind.&quot;&quot;Not for long,&quot; you mutter.&quot;I am not here physically. Your mind provides the necessary substrate from which I am able to project a body. Unfortunately, this makes this body liable to... manipulation. There are some negatives attached to this—&quot;&quot;No way. Really?&quot;&quot;Some negatives, but, in this situation, I will turn it to our advantage. You cannot appear in Satellite as...&quot; He wrinkles his nose, gestures vaguely to your face. &quot;It would be pandemonium. Instead, I will provide the necessary substrate, and we will see how the tables turn. In theory.&quot;&quot;You&#039;re going to imagine me really ugly? Or as a snake? Ugh!&quot; Of course he would. Of course he&#039;s petty like that. &quot;Richard, I can&#039;t be— you can&#039;t put me in a snake. I can&#039;t make a heroic speech as a snake! I refuse!&quot;&quot;Keep up like that, and maybe I&#039;ll see you try. You shouldn&#039;t be concerning yourself with the details, Charlotte. I&#039;m more interested in whether this reversal is possible at all. Consequently...&quot;Consequently you are sat at a rickety wrought-iron cafe table; consequently Richard offers you a cloudy glass of water to drink, places an unidentified tablet on his tongue, inserts a red cable into a hole in his neck— you ask if you can&#039;t just commune with him, or even possess him, sort of, and he shakes his head. &quot;This is more involved.&quot;If he says so. You lean forward and let Richard screw the cable into your own neck, even shut your eyes when he asks, even keep them shut when you start seeing sparks— is it wrong to comply? Does he get the wrong idea from it? But you want Satellite to work, want all of it to work, and this is how it will. This is how you&#039;ll get your actual father back. Everything will be worth it in the end.A cascade of sparks, a wave of dizziness, a nasty squishing sound: Richard can&#039;t be accused of doing nothing. Your fingers are twitching. &quot;Done yet?&quot;&quot;Can never wait, can you. We can try it, Charlotte. Open your eyes. Do you see me?&quot;Yes. He&#039;s right there. He doesn&#039;t look different. &quot;Good. Take this.&quot; He pushes a small rubber mallet across the table, then lays his hands flat on the table. You&#039;re disquieted by the hair on his wrists. &quot;Kindly hit me.&quot;It&#039;s not wrong to comply with that one, but it&#039;s too easy. You push the mallet back. &quot;No thanks.&quot;&quot;Stupid bitch. Every time. I&#039;m disappointed, Charlie. Your thirst for vengeance is that weak?&quot;(2/3)"

But there&#039;s a stingingness coming from somewhere.&quot;Well, I&#039;m in your head,&quot; you say. &quot;Are we done?

Your chair is knocked over.&quot;Don&#039;t do that,&quot; you say weakly.&quot;Not so fun now, is it? Can&#039;t say that.&quot; Richard says nothing instead, just lifts his thumb and forefinger, points at you, and flicks it sideways. You crumple and reappear where you were. &quot;I won&#039;t.&quot;&quot;I&#039;m serious!&quot; You grab your end of the cable. &quot;I&#039;m taking this out, Richard.&quot;&quot;You&#039;re not.&quot;&quot;I am! I— agck!&quot; You&#039;re not. Not without pulling your brain out through your nose, is how it feels. &quot;Okay, fine! You know what? You always say this stuff goes both ways. So if I&#039;m in your head, then— then— I&#039;m in your head. I can be in your head.&quot; You grip the cable loosely, then let it go and stare directly into Richard&#039;s eyes, which— were they always so yellow? Were they always so large? It&#039;s trivial to slip inside and be......not communing, you don&#039;t think. When you tried that with him, there was nothing inside. This is more involved, he said, and— you didn&#039;t go anywhere, you&#039;re still awake, at the table, looking into your own eyes, raising your own hand— Richard&#039;s hand— both hands, at once, flexing ten fingers, at once. But you can&#039;t mistake that for power, because Richard is right there, letting you do it. You are in his head, and he is in his head, is surrounding you, is unfamiliar and sharp-cornered and bitter-smelling: Charlie, he says, but really he says Karrrhi. He says both. Are you satisfied? There&#039;s nothing interesting here.Nothing interesting? He should&#039;ve known that&#039;d rile you up. Maybe he did. Maybe he meant for you to grip his hand (your hand (his hand)) and bare your perfect little teeth and plunge in. If he did, his exasperation is convincing— though, in fairness, you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re looking for. You just wanted to prove he couldn&#039;t kick you around.&gt;[TO BE CONTINUED...]"

Also, when Richard, with an all-encompassing air of exasperation, tried to grab you and pull you back out, you dodged. So far, so good. Of course, the deeper you go, the more Richard there is, and the less you can feel your own body— you are sitting there numbly and watching yourself slump, are overhearing Richard not-say For the love of God, Charlie; you are blundering through an overgrown thicket, old and dark and barbed, full of blind turns and false exits, convoluted, self-absorbed, self-absorbing. You are bleeding. You taste bitterness. If there was intended egress, it&#039;s indistinguishable from the rest, now. You are—I am truly failing to understand what purpose this is serving either of us.—you are tired. Richard is tired. The thorns only scratch when you charge straight through them. The exits are as hidden to him as to you. Is that enough, now? He is waiting for you at the center, in a trimmed clearing, planted, half-hazardly, with pink flowers; the empty pots have been thrown into the brush; the dirt is black and upturned. He is sitting at a wrought iron cafe table. Your face is pressed against a different table, and you are drooling through it: if you could see Richard, you&#039;d see his eyes closed. You sit down at the table in the clearing.Richard in the clearing is much taller than you. His fingers are long and pointed. His eyes are yellow. That is all you can see. He is cast entirely in shadow, no matter which angle you look.You&#039;ve taken my advice to heart. Richard in shadow speaks in snake. You understand perfectly, whether or not you want to. What advice? He&#039;s full of nothing but—Active interpretation. Cleanly done.Now, really. I don&#039;t want to injure you. What can I do to get you out?Nothing!! You&#039;ll never leave!! You&#039;re in his mind now, Richard, his mind, he foolishly let you in at last, and now you&#039;ll finally— now you&#039;ll— now you&#039;ll get the truth, and—You have the truth.You don&#039;t! He&#039;s always lying! You are standing from the table in the clearing— Richard stays seated, but the yellow eyes still hover above you. He&#039;s lying about something. He&#039;s plotting against you. Hiding away as a stupid snake so he doesn&#039;t have to answer questions— while his hatred for you comes to a boil—You will feel more rational when you return to your own body, I assure you. This is a common issue. Shall we go?He says that with vile, steaming, venomous malice. No, he doesn&#039;t. He says it matter-of-factly, and you can sense from everywhere his exact levels of weary forbearance. You hate him for not hating you. You need him desperately to— you need the thorns to lash down at you, ripping you to— you need him to call you a stupid bitch, not as a muted aside, but as a— you need him to threaten to kill everything you ever loved! Kill everything you ever loved again. You guess.(1/whatever)"

But he hesitates, and you discover the knives at the end of your paws, and—Fuck! You stubborn little shit!—use them in the direction of Richard&#039;s face. He teaches you a variety of snaky curse words as he drops you, and you sprint off for the (suddenly looming) thicket. It&#039;s over! He can&#039;t catch you now! It serves him right for being a snake, for being too little of a snake, for ruining your entire life and not putting it back. For not being able to put it back. For changing.

The shape is strangely familiar, and it takes you a moment to realize: oh! You&#039;re a lizard! But a little one, not a monstrous one: Richard&#039;s eyes loom down at you like the eyes of the Wyrm, and his mouth is full of daggers. &quot;Charlotte Fawkins,&quot; says the wind from the dark damp dagger-cave. &quot;This is no longer even remotely amusing. If you are trying to make a point, consider it made. I am defeated. Etcetera.

She would never—It was in fact your fault she would never—And in the distant past, you felt the most severe, grinding pain you had ever felt, which in your limited and miserable life was impressive.

You would&#039;ve liked to have known that while you still had a mouth, but that&#039;s fine. You can breathe through your nose. You will breathe through your nose, patiently, thinking positive, while the Wyrm decides what to do. If indeed that&#039;s a term that can be applied to its thought process. Yes, you are thinking positive. And if you make it out of here without a mouth, you&#039;re sure Richard can put it back. And if you make it out of here, Richard might apologize unprompted. For doubting you. If you make it out. You appear to be going in the wrong direction for that: you are falling very fast toward the surface of the eyeball, so the some-black becomes mostly-black becomes a glassy black infinity, and if the Wyrm doesn&#039;t like you coughing from a hundred miles up, it sure won&#039;t like you physically smacking into its eyeball.

And the Herald is there.You feel very strange indeed, watching that, and stranger when the Herald pokes her considerable neck through the rippling surface of the eye. She also stretches her less-than-considerable arm up, but you got the idea in the first place. You look at her. She looks at you. You&#039;re glad you don&#039;t have to figure out how to reach her (petition the Wyrm to lower you a few more feet?)— instead, the eye contact produces a nauseating stretching-oozing-doubling feeling, and you are pulled until you snap free and rebound inside.———Rebound inside.

As you&#039;ve been here forever, you have or will already said everything there is to possibly say, and asked or will ask all questions you could possibly ask.

Too late to tear it up and rebuild— much too late for you— but you would not leave yourself with vacant, dusty, bone-pale nothing. The only good parts were the font and Gil&#039;s garden in the wall. He didn&#039;t need it anymore; he had his own, now. You would.You could&#039;ve knocked out a wall, opened a door, but you took special pleasure in turning your head to the vaulted ceiling and speaking [OPEN] to the greatest, most intricate, most gemlike window of them all— the one with the sun in it— and watching it fall, and watching it shatter, coating the floor in shards of red light. The skeleton of the window swung and clattered out into the absolute darkness. You offered your hand out to Richard. &quot;Could you give me a boost?&quot;He did not reach back. &quot;And break my back, Herald? Use the door.&quot;&quot;Do you ever miss those long legs of yours?&quot; you said conversationally. &quot;Or that neck? You could use those to—&quot;&quot;You don&#039;t know about those yet.&quot;&quot;Oh. Sorry. It&#039;s hard. I— I&#039;m glad I&#039;m like this, you know.

Okay, now walk over there.&quot;&quot;You&#039;re lighter.&quot; He squeezed your ankle, but complied. There was still a sheer wall between you and the window-ledge, but you plunged your hands into the marble and made divots, and picked your way up that way. When you rolled onto the ledge at last, you reached your arm down for Richard. &quot;Jump.&quot;He fixed his tie. &quot;I will join you on my own, thank you.&quot;&quot;No you won&#039;t,&quot; you said, and pressed against your skin again, and then he sighed dramatically and stowed his glasses and hopped— it was really more of a hop. But you flung yourself down to catch his arm, then wrenched it up and free of him, and his paper body fluttered as you swung up, black and narrow arm in hand, snake in hand. It hissed in your face, and you laughed fangs-out at it and dropped it out the window. You followed.Richard was out there, in the blackness, brushing himself down. &quot;Was that necessary?&quot;No. It was very far from necessary. But out there, everything was necessary: everything was portentous, everything meant the fate of the world. It did not mean the fate of the world whether you swung Richard out the window, but you could do it, so you did. (1/5?)"

In your hand the flames whipped and whipped and grew gold and white and brilliant, so you could see them with your eyes closed, or from above. (In your diorama a pinprick blazes.) Down below, you caught the sun spinning on The Sword&#039;s very tip and flicked it out of reach. It hung in the sky, and the sky came with it. Fiat lux, Richard said.You almost needed the garden, too. Will have needed it. You took clippings from the heart-plant; you went down into your mind and dug up rosebushes and replanted them in dark soil. Richard wanted to do the soil, and you let him. You thought of bringing Gil in, to consult on trees, but could not. If he didn&#039;t notice, Teddy would. You took rootings from the tree in his nook, instead, and watered them from the font.

The Wyrm does not live, so it cannot die, in conventional wisdom. There is nothing there to kill. But the Wyrm is [WYRM], in its totality, and Laws can be... struck down. Naturally, to strike down [WYRM] is no simple task, or it would have been done. It would require enormous control over Law itself. Such as the control the Wyrm itself possesses.&quot;&quot;You already told me this,&quot; you said.&quot;Will I? It&#039;s important.

Were we finished with the garden?&quot;With the garden: it was enough for then, but you were not finished in total. You had planted out the area around the manse— the cathedral, was what it was, though you&#039;d always known that, had sculpted it yourself— but vast expanses laid sunlit but empty.

He helped. There was, after a great deal of time, a fire lake. You were hoping for literal fire, but settled on molten rock, which was still pleasingly orange. It did make it more convenient to cordon the garden off, at least, with a beach-slash-beachhead of white gravel. You could always have done more. Built out into the lake. New islands, tall bridges. Castles. Green mountains. Waterfalls. Things you&#039;ve only read in books. You could&#039;ve pile clouds into the sky, could&#039;ve make it night and scooped up the broken glass and put stars out. Richard would&#039;ve helped.But you were borrowing time, and the interest was mounting. There was such a thing as &#039;good enough&#039;. There had to be. And, within you, somebody was stirring.

Thus the bindings, if you recall them.&quot;&quot;And the drugs.&quot;&quot;And my drugging, yes, though that was less of a defensive measure. Still, it&#039;s remarkable that it worked at all, given who you are, or were. And who I was, and what I was. But what are we, if not remarkable?&quot;You ran gravel through your fingers. Your spleen was stirring. &quot;Yes. I— I really do have to—&quot;&quot;Then go, Lottie. I will live. Then I won&#039;t, but you get the gist. But, while you remain, I—&quot; He looked ought toward the lake. You couldn&#039;t see his eyes in the orange light. &quot;I am sorry.&quot;&quot;For?&quot;&quot;Don&#039;t push it.&quot; You whacked his arm, then, on further impulse, pulled him toward you. It was not a close hug or an intimate one and for the first couple seconds Richard did not understand what was happening. When he did, he didn&#039;t know how to participate, and patted you roughly on the side. You leaned in, smelled cigarettes, and whispered something in his ear. He stopped patting and clenched you a little harder.(4/something)"

If you had a random impulse to make a giant fire lake, then, by God, you were making one. &quot;Obviously. But maybe also... I was in your head, right?&quot;&quot;So you were. But we got that sorted out.&quot;&quot;I don&#039;t remember sorting it out? I remember— the eye, and— the Wyrm! Richard, I— I saw— not just imaginary— I was with the Wyrm. Like I traveled through your mind, somehow, but— you don&#039;t have— you haven&#039;t been talking to it, have you? I don&#039;t see how else there&#039;d be a portal—&quot;&quot;A portal? I don&#039;t think so. And if I had personal contact with the Wyrm, I&#039;d be a celebrity. More than likely... well... I have shared your memories of It. Of looking upon It directly. The Wyrm is [WYRM], and, in reproduction, it must remain so. In my mind and yours. And if the Wyrm is [WYRM], and nothing else is required for this to be true, then your memories and mine contain It.&quot;&quot;So the Wyrm is spying on us through our—?&quot;&quot;No. They have the capacity to be the Wyrm, not the permanent actuality. Or you would be the Wyrm now, yes? I would also presume that It might always be spying regardless, and that it will not matter one whit. We know you will be the Herald.&quot;(5/whatever)"

And Anthea, who wants to know how you did it so fast, and ends up interviewing Richard on the topic. It&#039;s an excellent time all around— even Richard seems to be in a good mood.

There is other shit going on, you know. Dice. Kaluki. Uh. One of the Court guys brought his own homemade game in, I think, but fuck knows what you do in it. Made a little board and everything. Hold that thought. Hail! Lord of Camp!&quot; You look up as Madrigal mock-bows. Monty, in a crooked paper crown, has approached. &quot;Hello to you too, Mads. Oh! Charlotte! You made it! Welcome to Game Night, though I really shouldn&#039;t— this is all Madrigal&#039;s. Ignore this.&quot; He straightens the crown. &quot;Eloise and friends were having a little fun. Anyway, I was tasked with finding you, Mads. We&#039;re rounding up a table for poker.&quot;&quot;Poker! This son-of-a-bitch! Looking for meat for the grinder, huh? Oh, sorry.&quot; Madrigal turns to you and Gil. &quot;This asshole Gewecke plays the best poker in camp.&quot;Monty waves it off. &quot;That&#039;s hardly—&quot;&quot;Hands down. He&#039;s going to whup my ass, and if you play he&#039;ll whup yours. Of course, it doesn&#039;t help, everyone being drunk as shit except him... just saying.&quot;&quot;She exaggerates, Charlotte. Besides, I, eh—&quot; He raises his glasses. &quot;I&#039;ve been mitigating that advantage somewhat, if that encourages you.&quot;&quot;Ha!&quot; Madrigal, elated, cuffs his arm. &quot;This bastard! Feeling ready to fly into a rage yet, Lord Gewecke?&quot;(3/5)"

It really is nice to see you.&quot; He pauses. &quot;It doesn&#039;t have to be for stakes.&quot; &quot;No stakes! Well, then, raw meat, c&#039;mon.&quot; She puts your hand on your and Gil&#039;s shoulders. &quot;Let&#039;s get grindered together.&quot;Which is how you wind up playing poker. After being informed it involved fighting cards against each other (sort of), you were excited about the switch; after being informed it also involved lying, you tried to back out, but by then it was too late. At least Gil is similarly reticent: he used to be okay at it, he says, but he hasn&#039;t played since before he got beetled. He&#039;s not sure if they&#039;ll let him help you or not.«I can.»Richard can. Enthusiastically, or as enthusiastically as he can as a slightly deadened voice. Is poker knowledge something he was &quot;born&quot; with? Was it downloaded on a micro-stick? Or is he downloading it now on your behalf? You decide you don&#039;t want to know. In any case, you&#039;re told which cards to play, which helps you not look like an idiot in front of Monty, Madrigal, Gil, Pat (&quot;Been a while, Charlotte&quot;), Eloise (&quot;Hey! Look who it is!&quot;), Guppy (she&#039;s still here? she doesn&#039;t say anything), two people you dimly recognize from camp but have never spoken to, one regular of the Better Than Nothing you&#039;ve never spoken to, and one Court recuit, judging by the feathers.You had no earthly idea so many could play. You also had no earthly idea poker was so complicated— Richard tells you cards, but then other people have their own cards, but they could be lying about their cards, and you&#039;re supposed to decide whether they&#039;re lying— and you have to try to lie yourself— and decide how much to bet— and it all falls apart for you. The whole thing is so stressful that you decide to ignore the lying part, play the cards Richard tells you every time, and bet big no matter what, because you&#039;re thinking positive. This doesn&#039;t work, but it does make people chuckle. Not meanly. You hope.In any case, you don&#039;t win. Not even close. You lose quick and hover awkwardly around the table, avoiding eye contact with the Courtier (who lost before you, thank God). Richard tells you that Gil is doing well for himself, and you want to cheer him on, even if you don&#039;t know when exactly to cheer. At length Madrigal stands, grinds her knuckles into Monty&#039;s scalp (he pats her arm), and comes around to you. The table is now Monty, Pat, Gil, Eloise, and the guy from the Better Than Nothing. &quot;Still here?&quot;&quot;Gil&#039;s winning,&quot; you say.&quot;Dunno about that, but he&#039;s putting up a fight, that&#039;s for sure. Between you and me, I thought he&#039;d be out first, given the...&quot; She mimes her hands shaking. &quot;...you know. But he&#039;s cool as ice. Freaky.&quot;Gil? Cool as ice? Maybe it&#039;s the goo. You shouldn&#039;t tell Madrigal about the goo, or she might think it&#039;s cheating. &quot;You didn&#039;t think I&#039;d be out first?&quot;(4/5)"

You tilt your head and study Madrigal— she juts her jaw and studies you back. At last it comes to you, fully-formed and shining. &quot;Ohhh.&quot;&quot;What?&quot; She&#039;s crossed her arms. &quot;I&#039;m fucking serious, Charlotte. I have a good life. Leave it alone.&quot;&quot;I miss my family too,&quot; you say. The impact is immediate. She recoils, as if struck, and glares, with actual hurt, as if... well, yes, as if you&#039;d reached out and smacked her. &quot;Sorry? Did I say anything about—?&quot;&quot;No.&quot; But when she was that giant snake, the place she made up— and it could&#039;ve been anywhere— was her family&#039;s old store. You&#039;re almost certain it was that. And she got all weird about it when you reminded her, didn&#039;t she? It&#039;s not the most comprehensive evidence, but your detective skills are masterful, after all, and you just had a feelig. A powerful feeling of absolute correctness, now, by her reaction, absolutely confirmed. &quot;But don&#039;t deny it. There&#039;s no reason to. That&#039;s, like— that&#039;s the most normal— who doesn&#039;t miss people up there? It&#039;d be way weirder if you didn&#039;t, in my opinion.&quot;Madrigal has stepped back far out of reach. In case you really do smack her, you guess. &quot;They didn&#039;t even come to my fucking execution. Fuck them. And fuck you too, by the way. I&#039;m glad you&#039;re dogshit at cards, and I hope you spend the rest of Game Night getting your ass—&quot;&quot;You don&#039;t need to say all that. I&#039;m sure they miss you too.&quot;Or maybe she stepped back so she wouldn&#039;t smack you. &quot;What the fuck do you know about—&quot;There was a little shrine for her in that store, but it&#039;s more than that. What do you know? You just do. It&#039;s all laid plain. &quot;I could— I don&#039;t know if I could make it like you never— I don&#039;t know if I could fix your whole life. I don&#039;t know if you even want it fixed like that, and it sounds complicated, and Ellery would really hate me if I made it so you never met him. So don&#039;t even worry about it. I think it&#039;d be nice if I set up a radio-thingy, though, so people up there could talk to people down here, even if they couldn&#039;t visit. Or I could make a really, really tall staircase? And if you walk all the way up, you could sort of... you&#039;d be right under the surface of the water, and you could see out, and...&quot;&quot;Charlotte?&quot;&quot;Yeah?&quot;&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;&quot;Huh? I mean, when I&#039;m God. Which&#039;ll be soon!&quot; You point. &quot;And whatever I settle on, I&#039;ll get you a VIP pass, okay?

The other people at the table, none of whom you know well, are politer. Apparently they&#039;re just about to wrap up and reset, so you came at an opportune time: there is a hand-drawn board and pebbles and dice, and the rules, for your benefit, are recapped at length. Hopefully Richard got all that.«Under no circumstances should I be your first resort here.»But he got all that?«Yes.»Great. You&#039;ll do the dice-rolling, and if you need to do anything else he can tell you what. That&#039;s teamwork, is what it is. The good news is that the game calls for plenty of dice, and when they come around to you, you rub them around in your hands, blow on them, and think positive, positive, positive. Then: release!Six. Six.Double sixes! Of course! The best result— right? Richard?«Yes. Now move your pebble.»The best result, and all because you thought positive. God, you&#039;re good. The squares on the board spiral inward, and you happily skip your pebble over everybody&#039;s, making sure to whack Claudia&#039;s as you pass it. Of course, several of them pass you on their next turns, but it&#039;s fine! You&#039;re thinking positive. You will be victorious. Six. Six.Double sixes. A winner&#039;s roll. Someone whistles. Someone says &quot;beginner&#039;s luck!&quot; Claudia smirks over at you, exposing pointy baby fangs, and grabs the dice. Her roll is unremarkable.You spend the time until next turn ignoring your fellow players. You&#039;re thinking about double sixes. When the dice come around, you don&#039;t bother blowing or shaking: you toss them down as soon as you&#039;ve grabbed them. Six. Six. Now people are staring. &quot;What are the odds of that?&quot; someone says. &quot;You&#039;re sure these things aren&#039;t loaded, Hugh?&quot; &quot;Well, we&#039;ve all been using them.&quot; &quot;You got a technique?&quot; someone asks you. &quot;Do it again,&quot; Claudia says.(2/6)"

One.Your attention has already drifted back to the board: you have leaned over, plucked up your pebble (not white, exactly, but paler than the rest), and marched it down twenty-six spaces, which takes you to the center. &quot;I win,&quot; you say, so you can leave and lie down. You are cold and something hard is in the center of your chest.Nobody appreciates that. Claudia lowers the dice. Hugh-or-whoever is trying to explain something, and Richard in your ear is trying to explain almost the same thing, about win conditions and specific criteria and how you would stall— your pebble would stall out in the central loop until you&#039;d fulfilled those, marching around and around, no matter how well you rolled, to avoid this exact situation, and if you&#039;d listened to even a little bit of the rules you would understand that, Charlie. Richard does not appear to understand that something is happening. &quot;Roll a 6 and a 1 together,&quot; Claudia says. You and Richard are the only ones who remember the game. You shut your eyes, so you don&#039;t have to see it happen, but all you see is the blue tangle of the die warping as it nears you and popping into place when it lands. Your own strings blaze; the center of your chest is pure white. Though you&#039;re cold, you&#039;re sweating.When you open your eyes half the table is standing to accommodate the small crowd that&#039;s gathered. Two new dice are dropped in front of you. You&#039;d rather not roll them, actually, but you are a foot away from your body: Six. Six. Six. Six. If you look too hard you can see them landing differently: six six six five, one four one three, three five six two, the crowd moaning and dispersing, but only one of them is right— like how you were right about Madrigal— like how you&#039;ll be right about everything, how you&#039;ll win, in the end, how you&#039;ll be God, and right, and just, and perfect. Six six six six six six six six. Is that Gil in the crowd? You think you might need him. Or Richard. You&#039;ll settle for Richard. You just need help. Please?...(3/6)"

You were content with this, or called it content, or did not know anything otherwise. After some eternities passed, though, you began to wonder if other beings existed, and if they did exist, why they did not reveal themselves to you. You hated them for not revealing themselves. The alternative was deeming yourself alone.After another eternity, nothing had come. The void had sanded away at you, though, coating you with mounds of scale-dust, thick enough in places to be the width of you again. You thought of shaking it off, first, and did: it scattered around you and hung there, and some clumped up. Still there was more dust, and you thought at last of putting something inside it.You had long since abandoned the idea of an equal, but it appealed to you to make something in your image: narrow and long, glistening scales, burning eyes. These were your offspring, and they were perfect, and the world remained so. For an eternity longer, your offspring burrowed through the dust, called sand, and created pleasing patterns. For an eternity you were again content.But you began to know the patterns by heart, and, to create more patterns, you were forced to create more offspring. They could do little on their own. At length you began to resent this friction, and turned your mind to a means of self-reproduction.Thus entered the slaves, who took some of your resemblance, but who walked atop the sand— they could not burrow, or it would be too crowded. All the same, you made them long and narrow, the shape of your offspring buried within them. You were pleased with the cleverness of your devising: to reproduce themselves, your offspring would lunge from the sand, take hold of a slave, and work themselves into the slave&#039;s feeble brain; the slave would thus rip itself apart, in doing so bearing offspring of its own. Unfortunately, you lacked ideas for making slaves self-replicate, and trusted they would devise something. Or, barring that, you would make new ones in batches: they had more nuance than your offspring, so it was less of a chore. All was thus good and perfect.———Your nose is wet. You&#039;re on your cot.

That&#039;s my assessment. Do you feel this?&quot; Your right eye spasms uncontrollably. &quot;Don&#039;t do that!&quot;&quot;Better now than in Satellite. You will be profoundly vulnerable there. We may thank the great and merciful Herald, Charlotte, that I will have a leash on you, and that we will be additionally working on a clock. Resultingly, there will be zero serendipity, zero sightseeing, zero... sojourns. Zero. I am deadly serious about this. You must be inconspicuous.&quot;&quot;I thought I was supposed to be the Herald.&quot;&quot;To the Director. Which we must get to. As a blunt reminder, this is your absurd request, so I trust you will not sabotage it. Do you understand?&quot;Clever to ask you while drilling wires into your brain, or whatever nastiness he&#039;s up to now (you can&#039;t see it, but you sure can feel it). If you don&#039;t understand, maybe he&#039;ll slip. But geez, is there anything else?&gt;Future Richard&#039;s patience is short! (Has he suffered some unspeakable trauma in the future? Or maybe he&#039;s just Richard.) Ask up to 2. &gt;[1A] What if an agent stops you and tries to talk to you?&gt;[1B] What if you get lost? Or separated from him?&gt;[1C] What should you expect from the Director? (Has he sussed out any weak points from his future-research?)&gt;[1D] What if you can&#039;t be the Herald?&gt;[1E] Can he warn you about what you&#039;ll see in Satellite? So you don&#039;t look like you&#039;re gawking at everything?&gt;[1F] Write-in. &gt;[2] Actually, you&#039;re fine. You&#039;ll figure it out on the fly, like usual. (No questions: proceed.)"

Doesn&#039;t this hurt your throat?&quot;&quot;No.&quot; Richard has turned his back. &quot;I will be initiating the transfer in very short order.

Thin. You smell chemicals. The pipe stretched you out— you feel stretched, and hard, and dizzy. There is a floor, with unflattering carpet, and you are standing on it. You thought you&#039;d be floating: is it not the moon? You thought it&#039;d be different. More different. But everything is beige. You appear to have spots.Richard is a lizard. You&#039;d dither about whether it is Richard, but you&#039;re in his head: if you strain, your vision splits, and you see your own lizard face staring on up. But you don&#039;t care about yours. Richard is a snake-lizard-man, scaled in charcoal grey from head to toe, with a narrow angular snout and narrow yellow eyes. He is obscuring the eyes with glasses, maybe to see you better: their arms rest in a ridge by his jaw. His earless, hairless head perches on the end of a muscular neck, doubled up and resting on itself. Unrolled, it&#039;d be three feet long.The neck flows into a— you know that suit! That&#039;s Richard&#039;s new suit! The ugly tattersall one. The collar of his shirt is oversized and pointy and the tie is far too thick. You suppose snake(people?) have different standards of fashion, but— under it all, Richard&#039;s torso is short and thin, and his arms are long, and his legs are longer— between that and the neck, how tall is he? And why does he not tuck his shirt in? And how tall are you, to not be dwarfed by him?(1/3)"

(You know it&#039;s him, because you&#039;re not the one embarrassed.) How were you supposed not to ogle? His lizard fingers have small claws. His nostrils are slits. He must hear from those holes in his skull. What would happen if you poked your finger in there?»You will not.«Richard&#039;s voice comes from all around. You stick out your tongue— your— is it a lizard tongue? You try to feel, but your fingers are not sensitive, and your mouth is full of sharp little teeth. No change there. You attempt to see through Richard&#039;s eyes, but he&#039;s put a wall up: instead, he places a hand on your head and turns you around. You are facing a desk, a lizard desk: a flat typewriter lies on it, and a few crumpled paper cups, and, behind them, a box. The box is square in the back and curved in the front, and is beige, but the front is black glass: you can see your reflection in it.You are also a lizard. You expected that. You have spots— you expected that too, because your hands did. White scales with grey spots. Your eyes are yellow. Your lizard face is a lot rounder than Richard&#039;s, and your snout shorter, and your neck much shorter. Perhaps a foot in length. Is that his fault? Did he make it short? Damn him!On your neck— you tilt your head to look— are little nubby spines, which run down your back and your— ooh! Ooh! You have a tail! You mean, of course you do, because you&#039;re a lizard. It isn&#039;t very big, and it also has spots, and you can&#039;t really move it, try as you might. But when you grab it, you feel it. &quot;R—&quot;Richard lashes out and clamps your mouth shut— you mean actually clamps it; his hand curls around your snout. Your opinion of snouts drops considerably. »Think.«Richard?»Yes. Like that.«Richard, you have a tail.»I know.«The lizard face betrays no emotion, but he doesn&#039;t sound flippant. After a moment, he bends his neck down (and down and down) to see over your shoulder, then withdraws. The eyes like spotlights fix on you again....Is it a special tail? Is he embarrassed because his tail is so much worse? You attempt to crane your own neck, but it doesn&#039;t go very far: you have to shuffle past him, in this cramped little wherever-you-are, to check. Richard has no tail at all. He doesn&#039;t even have a flap in his slacks for one. Aha! Is that why he&#039;s so mean all the time? He&#039;s a tailless freak?The embarrassment has been crowded out by soft annoyance. «We do not have tails.»But you do?»Because you are the freak.«»It is atavistic. You appear to the eye to be primitive. Also, stunted.«»You have perhaps escaped the breeding program.«The breeding program? You don&#039;t want to know. And it&#039;s his fault you look like this.»As it is your fault I look like that.«»It is not... bad, Charlie. It is what you are. It is...«»I am glad to see you at last.«(2/3)"

You duck through a nest of wires to discover a rectangular tank, a little larger than the box up top, filled with water. Inside floats a blank-eyed black-and-yellow snake. A note is stuck to the glass, filled with scribbled runes, which nestle in your mind as Little bastard.You pluck the note off and hold it up. Hey! Look what you—Richard snatches it from you. (Back to embarrassment.) »We have dithered long enough. Set that down.« You have grabbed a conical purpleish thingy, filled with drifting orange blobs: at last, something weird-looking! »It is a lamp. Come on.«It is the only decorative object in this whole little space, emphasis on little: if Richard stood in the middle and stretched his long arms out, he could likely touch both sides of the wall. Above and around the desk are a load of enticing buttons and switches, a panel of blinking lights, a image of numbers and a moving zigzag line, a glowing sign that translates vaguely to &quot;LIVING,&quot; or &quot;AIRING&quot;—»Live. On air.«—bits of paper where notes were ripped down, a bulky radio headset hanging on a hook, and that&#039;s all. In the center of the space, which has three walls and an empty back, is a battered chair with an extremely long headrest. His snake chair. Where he sits? Where he sleeps? Or does he go somewhere else to—»No.«Can he at least knock himself out, like he knocks you out?»No.«Oh. And that&#039;s it. How often does he leave?»Rarely.«»Let&#039;s go, Charlotte.

His office-thingy has another next to it, and another next to that, and on and on, out of sight: as you hurry past, you discover that most are unoccupied. A glancing few house scaly heads bent over glowing boxes: the agents clack away on their typewriters, or else they yammer away to nobody. Have they found the Crown in their realities? Have they put up shop in some poor sap&#039;s head? Will that poor sap ever, ever, ever discover a fraction of what you know now?At least there&#039;s less poor saps then there used to be, from the looks of it. Were a bunch of Correspondents recycled recently?«No.»...Then where are they?«It doesn&#039;t matter. Keep walking.»You&#039;d think Richard would learn by now: with an answer like that, you can&#039;t not wonder. When you reach at last the end of the &quot;cubes,&quot; the path goes straight and to the right. Richard continues straight, but there are noises to the right, loud convivial lizard-noises, and you duck off to the right. It&#039;s simple to locate these noises&#039; source: an open door, and, inside, a whole gaggle of Correspondents. So that&#039;s where they went! They appear to be throwing a party.Aww. Did Richard not get invited? Is that why he didn&#039;t want to tell you? Your curiosity sated, you make to head back, but catch a stray phrase from the crowd: &quot;...Herald in short order...&quot;Herald! That&#039;s you! What is the party for, anyways? Surely agents don&#039;t celebrate birthday, or holidays, and you think recyclings happen without warning. The crowd is crowded around someone, though: a light brown, blocky-looking Correspondent, busy receiving a round of backslaps. It&#039;s hard to make him out— or it, or whatever— over the din: &quot;...couldn&#039;t have done it without... look forward to... yes, the Object is... not seen the Herald yet, but...&quot;»What are you &gt;doing&lt;.«»What did I &gt;say&lt; about sightseeing.«Richard grabs the bow around your neck and yanks you, stumbling, back to the left. You weren&#039;t sightseeing. You were investigating a very important-seeming party, in which people were talking about the Herald, i.e. you, and— does he know the brown Correspondent? With the square sort of head? Because it seemed like a lot of the attendees were paying attention to him, and...»Fuckface.«»We are not dwelling on this. Keep moving.«Wait. That was Richard&#039;s sworn nemesis? He didn&#039;t look very evil— you liked his patterned tie. So the party was for... wait, wait, wait. You&#039;re in the future! Did him and Jean Ramsey win? Is that a— a— a victory—»A premature one. This is irrelevant.«It blatantly is not, Richard! He needs to tell you whether you&#039;re doomed or not!(1/4)"

The room located straight ahead is painted the same horrible beige and is lit by the same horrible lights, but there are floor-to-ceiling windows on your left— they look out onto a vast hollow enclosed space, its inner surface lit in squares, its shape held by enormous struts, its emptiness broken by tubelike bridges, none of which intersect with— or even near— a large red-glowing spherical thing in the center. You&#039;ll take a stab at it: it&#039;s the original BrainWyrm, and a faint buzz of approval from ahead marks it so. The whole thing is less impressive than it should be, because it mostly just looks like Headspace. But Richard never said snakes were original.On your right, the open-faced &quot;cubes&quot; are replaced with a network of larger, windowed— are these offices? They look officey. When you pass by one of them (it looks the same as the rest), Richard tries to push your head down. »Move quick.«Huh? You do crouch, but don&#039;t move. Why? How can anybody even see you?

Who&#039;s in there? Another nemesis? The nameplate reads &quot;R/D-C #1.&quot; Wait, that—The grey-brown agent inside has looked up. Richard shoves you down hard: you wind up flat on the rough carpet, and can only hear the resulting conversation. &quot;Hello? Is that Wingnut?&quot;&quot;No,&quot; Richard says out loud. &quot;Out and about? And here? The high-and-mighty Wingnut comes to visit little old me? Did your box explode or something? Given what you do to the thing—&quot;&quot;I am going.&quot;&quot;No you&#039;re not! Come in! Or should I come out there?&quot; If Richard was radiating lukewarm annoyance for you, he is radiating icy poisonous annoyance here, and you&#039;re not all that surprised when he turns his eyes on you and— like a fist closes around you— you are not there on the floor any longer.You are not anywhere, and you remain nowhere for who-knows-how-long until you flicker and gain feeling and fall to your knees: this is slightly awkward, with the narrowness of lizard knees, and the weight of the tail, and you flail before catching yourself on the ground. The metal ground? You aren&#039;t in a carpeted room anymore: you&#039;re in a very small, vibrating one. »Elevator.« (2/4)"

Um, I haven&#039;t received any instructions. Like I said. And it&#039;s the BrainWyrm that determines who to recycle, and nobody knows how it works anymore, so...&quot;&quot;So the BrainWyrm usurped the previous Director.&quot;The Director is inscrutable in his lizardness (this is very inconvenient for you), but his lizard voice, once sufficiently parsed, sounds confused. &quot;Maybe?

You digest yourself— you— consume— the gulfweed bridges the gaps between people, and— oh, God— what if there is no gap? What if the gulfweed is trying to connect you to—What if the gulfweed— Your own thoughts ring tinny in your ears. You are really just vomiting: have generated a substantial puddle. (The Director is wringing his hands and wondering aloud about towels.) Your blurry eye, your bad eye, is blind. Goop is coming out. Why didn&#039;t Richard stop you? He didn&#039;t even try— you&#039;re in his head— and he&#039;s only behind a door. Does he know this is happening?»Yes.«And he&#039;s letting you puke on the Director&#039;s floor?»An excellent source has informed me that it will all work out in the end.«An excellent source? Ah. An excellent source. You. You will tell him it will work— him in the past— and he will carry that knowledge onto the future. He&#039;s known it&#039;ll work out the whole time, and he still opted to badger you left and right. Typical Richard. Still, you should&#039;ve known: the only way out is through. Herald. (Your gut sucks inward.) Herald. (You are turning, it feels, inside out.) Herald. (You are in a small hot space inside your skin, and everything surrounding is semi-solid.) Herald. Heave up and out and expel about a gallon of goop— narrowly missing the Director&#039;s shoes— and a thing about the size of a marble. Fall forward and stain your hands black. Look at the marble.It is glowing violently. &quot;What is that?&quot; the Director is saying, panicked. &quot;Are you okay? Do I need to get you— I mean, call someone to get you— I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a tube open, if you&#039;ve caught ill, or—&quot;You pick up the sun. It&#039;s hot in your sticky palm, but doesn&#039;t burn. You roll it around, uncertain, then remember. Is anything left of your bad eye? It&#039;s melted entirely. You hold your eye socket open and slide it in. It fits. You blink.It radiates backward, the sun&#039;s light, flooding your mind and then your body. Neither can contain it. For your body, you arch up and stretch out, your neck unrolling smoothly, and your tail— and no spots. For your mind?The Director has scrabbled all the way back to the wall, where he&#039;s frozen, limbs splayed, like a pinned bug. &quot;H— He— Her—&quot;A second before you say the words, you hear yourself saying them— so you&#039;re only repeating. You don&#039;t know where they come from. A script. Don&#039;t be afraid.&quot;Herald,&quot; the Director whimpers.I&#039;m not here to punish you. Even though I did tell you so. The Director has lived its life in this room. It doesn&#039;t know evil. I&#039;m not here to bring the Dawn either. Please don&#039;t ask about that.(2/5)"

There is no danger.&quot;I—&quot; Its first attempt at speech in a minute. &quot;I don&#039;t really—&quot;It is not a complex request, either. First, I told you of the party. You must end it. Second, there is a Correspondent. #301. He must be unassigned from his client.&quot;I don&#039;t know how to do those things.&quot; A complete sentence! But its voice is stiff. &quot;Great One. I apologize.&quot;You will figure it out. You are the Director.&quot;I— I cannot leave the room.&quot;Is that all? You turn your neck toward the door. It clicks. Go, then. With my blessing. But do not speak of me.The Director is gaping, exposing its little pointy teeth. You swing your neck back and nudge it gently. Go!You had not intended for it to run. But the Director runs from you. It will do as you bid.You watch the pocket-world outside the window until the door creaks, then shuts. &quot;Oh, Charlie,&quot; Richard says.His reflection is in the glass: you train your eye on it, and it splits, into lizard and man and man and snake. When you turn, though, he is only lizard. He has approached, and reaches one slender arm out to feel your neck. &quot;What a magnificent creature you are.&quot;You would die, you say, to make this of me?&quot;Are you proposing alternatives?&quot;You sway. No.&quot;I didn&#039;t think so. Now, come on. Let&#039;s get this off you.&quot;You see, in your mind&#039;s eye, him hooking his clever lizard fingers through a seam in your neck, him wiggling, and in life you hold still and let him. Cool air flows in as he tosses the neck, all painted cardboard, aside. You prod your face. Still scaly. You have two eyes. No sun. &quot;Turn,&quot; Richard says, and you turn, dazedly, as he slides the felt tail off yours. It droops in his hands. &quot;Will mine be that long?&quot; you say.&quot;Do you want it to be?&quot;&quot;...Wouldn&#039;t it drag on the floor?&quot;&quot;Yours will be half that length. Perhaps a little less. A good length.&quot; He folds the tail up, and it vanishes. &quot;Yeah,&quot; you say. &quot;I—&quot;&quot;It&#039;s alright, Charlie.&quot;&quot;I— I— I was—&quot;&quot;I know.&quot;&quot;I was,&quot; you say limply. &quot;I know. I believe your task is complete now. You should be returning.&quot; He tilts his head. &quot;Nobody should want to remain in Satellite long. We do not. Yes? Conceded?&quot;&quot;I should sleep,&quot; you mumble. (3/4 jk)"

What the hell!&quot;You are in Satellite in your human body, or a very near approximation, and Richard is still a lizard. Richard is an extremely tall lizard. You come up to his chest; he could open his jaws and swallow your head. But he won&#039;t. He&#039;s not a beast.

I&#039;ll incinerate you first!&quot; It&#039;s easy to get a little mad, but hard to get a lot mad— not when you&#039;re in his head, and therefore surrounded by Richard-brand, dare you say it, jolliness.&quot;Well, forgive me. I&#039;ve only been conceiving of this moment for the entirety of my waking life, Charlie.&quot; He looks you up and down, probably to savor the image for the continued remainder of his life, then digs his claws loosely into your scalp. &quot;Stay right there. Yes. Just like that.&quot;He presses down suddenly, then swings you up by the scruff of your neck— you are much smaller, and fluffy, and he laughs and laughs at your startled hissing, then he folds his hands around you and collapses you and you are gone.———You awaken flat on your back, then bolt upright. Richard in his human body is across the way, staring at all the wires hooked up to you— Richard who, as you fix a gimlet eye upon him, flickers badly and reappears as a lizard. &quot;Ha!&quot; you say. &quot;Ha! Ha-ha!&quot;&quot;...&quot; Lizard Richard stares down at his lizard hands, then turns his neck to make eye contact. You think make eye contact. It&#039;s hard to tell where those creepy eyes are looking. &quot;How?&quot;&quot;How? What do you mean, how? I just saw—&quot; Wait. &quot;Are you from the future?&quot;&quot;No.&quot; Lizard Richard opens and closes his hands. &quot;I take it I was here. You went.&quot;&quot;I sure did! Could you help get this stuff out of my neck? I don&#039;t want to bleed to death.&quot;&quot;I take, from your mood, it went well.&quot; He comes over, but hesitates to touch you.&quot;Sure did! Is something the matter? Um, in the present? I wasn&#039;t gone for very long, was I?&quot;&quot;No. You were gone for no time at all.

As of the current point in the quest, it has been just over a month since you were forced into hiding, and just over two weeks since you forced Lucky to let you return. The progress you&#039;ve made over the course of the month is detailed (extensively) above the update. Per my roll, you have 22 DAYS REMAINING until your vile nemesis Jean Ramsey needs that missing tine of the Crown back. What will you do with that time? That&#039;s up to you!&gt;Because 22 days remain, you have 22 TIME UNITS (TUs) to spend. These time units don&#039;t correspond 1:1 with days, because you may be unconscious for some of those 22 days and can&#039;t spend them doing anything-- we&#039;ll say it all averages out. &gt;Different actions will consume different amounts of TIME UNITS. Actions will specify the number of TUs they consume in (parentheses). Some actions you can take multiple times, and some you can&#039;t: read to find out!&gt;[Herald&#039;s Mind] and [Herald&#039;s Body] will be automatically leveled to maximum by the end of the timeskip, so don&#039;t worry about them. [Snaketongue] will be automatically leveled to [Snaketongue V], allowing you to speak and write the agents&#039; language fluently. If you wish, you can level it further.&gt;At this point, with a fairly well-rounded &quot;build,&quot; you might consider picking a couple perks to focus on. Just a suggestion. It&#039;s up to you!——————————————————Okay, ready?

No guarantees about what the Director will actually accomplish, though.&gt;He complains endlessly about how we mentally compress him into an unnatural shape (a shape, I might add, his whole plan hinged on us compressing him into to exploit those emotional backdoors) but the moment we give him his actual body he&#039;s all like &quot;oh uh this is actually weird gimme the old thing back&quot;. So frustrating.Well, you know, he&#039;s like a cat: he wants out, you open the door, he wants back inside again. But more genuinely: the &quot;compressing&quot; largely applied to the snake and the previous secretly-your-father body, where he was constantly beset by mental pressure to conform to the father-shaped hole in your heart (and eventually beset by so much pressure he *did* conform). While this was part of his plan, realistically he vastly underestimated how powerful the effect would be. Took a big L on that one.The new desk jockey body, while it might still come with some minor &quot;compressing&quot; effects, isn&#039;t your father either consciously or subconsciously. He&#039;s literally just some guy, so being him isn&#039;t painful or existentially scary in the same way, and Richard is basically fine with it--- or prefers it in some ways. He has spent a whole lot of time human, after all, in a way almost no agent (barring Management) has.&gt;For the last four, I wanna progress Extrareal as much as possible. Can we get some kind of Richard/Ellery collab to get better returns off basic training or anything more effective than just pickingIf [Unionized Ellery] gets bumped to V, or [Eloise] gets bumped to III, I&#039;ll upgrade you to ++ [Extrareal].

When you want to be.&gt;[The Herald&#039;s Body VII]: You are the Herald. Or as close as a human can get. Also, you have a tail. &gt;[Extrareal V]: You absorb reality into yourself within a 10-foot radius. This is obvious to anybody metaphysically attuned, and the non-attuned get a very strange feeling around you.&gt;[Snaketongue V]: You can speak, read, write, and comprehend Richard&#039;s native language, even if you don&#039;t know how.&gt;[Legerdemain IV]: You can pull either largeish things or implausible things out of thin air, but not both.&gt;[Earthsense IV]: If you have access to earth, you can perceive things about a mile out. &gt;[Communion IV]: You can enter people&#039;s minds on eye contact (and, from there, their bodies), and it&#039;s very difficult to remove you.&gt;[On Fire! IV]: You can&#039;t shoot fire out of your hands. (They get too hot.) But you *can* shoot it from The Sword, and things within your Extrareal radius will actually light. &gt;[Advanced (Advanced) Gaslighting IV]: You don&#039;t have to try very hard at all to make the things you say true.&gt;[The Sun III]: The sun in your chest is about the size of two hands making a circle. You can&#039;t do too much with it, but maybe it&#039;ll help out if you&#039;re in duress.&gt;[Red Stuff III]: You have a decent handle on the red stuff. Enough of a handle for 12 SV? Uh...&gt;[OPEN III]: You can use [OPEN] semi-regularly, though the exact effects are still out of your control.&gt;[Good With A Sword III]: You&#039;re a little better with a sword than you used to be. On par with a professional murderess with decades of experience? Uh... you&#039;ll need to rely on other skills.&gt;[Fingerwork II]: You can touch strings with your bare hands, provided you can get your bare hands into somebody&#039;s body.

But you&#039;ve achieved a level of understanding with him that you don&#039;t have with others.&gt;[Annie V]: Annie is your favorite worm of all time. You don&#039;t know her any better than you did the first time she was alive, though.&gt;[Claudia V]: Claudia has forgiven you for murdersorbing her, and now swings between treating you like a younger sister and treating you like an older one. You never know how to treat her back, but she doesn&#039;t seem to care. &gt;[Earl IV]: Earl is always happy to see you, and, despite yourself, you&#039;re always happy to see him. He&#039;s always willing to unquestioningly lend a hand-- and he&#039;s is thrilled about the tail. That helps.&gt;[Henry IV]: You&#039;ve never told Henry you don&#039;t remember him, and you never will. You&#039;d feel too bad. Even if you can&#039;t muster up the closeness he feels to you, he has been unrelentingly kind and patient, and he knew your father. He&#039;ll tell you about your father if you ask. Even if he could offer nothing else, that alone would be worth it. &gt;[Madrigal IV]: Can you even call Madrigal a rival anymore? She&#039;s as rough around the edges as ever, but you&#039;ve earned her respect several times over, and you guess you respect her too. She&#039;s been through a lot, and she&#039;s still up and ready to kick ass, and that&#039;s not nothing.&gt;[Anthea IV]: Anthea is so unconditionally nice, and so excited that you&#039;re actively participating in Spelunkers&#039; Associated, and so willing to help with whatever, that it&#039;s downright infectious. You struggle for any reason to dislike her. She even apologized for doubting Gil all those months ago, for God&#039;s sake. &gt;[Us IV]: Us wishes that things were different. That the world was not barreling towards its ending, and that you were not barreling with. But it has come to understand (with Claudia&#039;s prodding) that it must be so, and that the things you have done, perhaps, must have happened. It will even let you back into its dream, if you ask nicely.&gt;[Pat III]: Even after everything you&#039;ve done for her, Pat remains cool toward you. If you&#039;d saved Lester, maybe it&#039;d be different. But she&#039;s polite, and she helps with goo mishaps, and you&#039;re not sure what else you can ask for.&gt;[Monty III]: Every time you see him, Monty always looks a little sad and a little tired. But he hasn&#039;t strangled you again, nor, as far as you know, anybody else, and Madrigal tells you he&#039;s doing better than he was. Certainly he&#039;s never stopped trying to lend a hand, and you&#039;re not planning on rejecting him this time."

If we&#039;re unlucky, she&#039;s conscripting. Or not even that, Charlotte. The Game isn&#039;t really a &#039;tournament,&#039; see. It&#039;s freeform. You play until you retire, until you die, or until you... win. I won. She won. A few retire. Most die. The violence is limited to legal participants, but I fear how broad her definition of &#039;participants&#039; may be. It could be anybody who looks at her funny.

I hope so, Charlotte, but it&#039;s rarely that easy. Ask me how I know.&quot; Monty slips the invitation back into the folder. &quot;No need to try to backtrack that. Madrigal told me.&quot;&quot;Madrigal has a big mouth,&quot; you mutter.&quot;She felt I should know. I told her I did. Or I thought so. Have people been making requests of you?&quot;&quot;Yes.&quot;&quot;Only logical. I won&#039;t. I don&#039;t believe there&#039;s anybody who&#039;s owed a miracle less.&quot;(2/7)"

You were talking to Madrigal, and she mentioned Pat, and you asked where Pat was, and Madrigal said she&#039;d been spending a lot of time there— and what were you supposed to do, let Pat do all the charitable visits? She isn&#039;t even a good person.&quot;What are you doing here?&quot;And of course she&#039;s there when you stop by, her and a thing with five faces and a few wary-looking others. &quot;HELLO, CHARLOTTE FAWKINS,&quot; the thing says from its mouths. &quot;IS ALL WELL?&quot;&quot;Yeah,&quot; you say to Us— one of the Uses— and, to Pat, &quot;What do you mean? Can&#039;t I be wherever I want?&quot;&quot;Sure. I just thought, after you exploded these people&#039;s lives, you&#039;d check in soon or check in never. It&#039;s been months. The timing&#039;s weird, Charlotte. Is there something you want from them?&quot;&quot;No! Why do you always have a bug up your butt, huh? Can&#039;t I normally visit the people whose lives I heroically saved? It&#039;s nice to meet you, um...&quot; You wave in the direction of the employees.&quot;You&#039;re the fucking journalist,&quot; one of them says. &quot;If Iris were here to see this!

Wait. &quot;Glenn&quot; looks familiar. &quot;...Um, I toured Headspace, before it got blown up... but it went wrong, a little. I&#039;m not a journalist, though. I&#039;m a sworn heroine.&quot;&quot;Oh,&quot; Glenn says. &quot;Should&#039;ve guessed.&quot;The silence is tenser than you&#039;d like. &quot;You&#039;re welcome for me blowing it up,&quot; you prompt.Some dark chuckles from the employees. &quot;THE SITUATION IS SOMEWHAT COMPLEX,&quot; Us chips in.(3/7)"

In any case, you must model heroic graciousness for them. &quot;Um, sure.&quot;You get a tour. Headspace&#039;s survivors— found or rescued, by Madrigal and co.&#039;s search parties, informed of their situation, then left alone to work it out— had a variety of reactions to their newfound freedom. Brand new employees, with clear memories of the world outside, had it best. Some of them up and left, hiking into Hell or the Fen or wherever. Most people weren&#039;t able to, physically. There were rumors someone tried and dissolved. And there was confusion, there was resentment, there was guilt, there was grief: everybody knew somebody crushed in the rubble or lost to the goo or so &quot;managed&quot; (as they called it) they couldn&#039;t be nursed back to health. Or sanity.And there was violence. Amidst the chaos of the first few weeks, fingers were pointed, factions were formed, territory was staked out. &quot;You saw the paintball,&quot; Glenn told you. &quot;Departments already hated each other.&quot; The big split was between the &quot;suckoffs&quot; and the rest: the suckoffs tended to be higher in the hierarchy, or had worked for longer, and felt the implosion was an unmitigated tragedy. That, or they thought Management would inevitably return, and business should continue as usual so the punishment wouldn&#039;t be drastic. The rest saw the implosion as a mixed bag, but Management&#039;s destruction as a universal good, and banded together in fiery hatred of anybody who&#039;d defend them. The especially hateful— no small number— scrounged weapons and set off to kill anyone who&#039;d worked a little too high up the ladder.And did they? &quot;Uh...&quot; Glenn says. &quot;Yeah.&quot; About 20 people wound up dead, not all of them suckoffs. &quot;It wasn&#039;t good. I wasn&#039;t involved.&quot;Everybody&#039;s cooled off since then, from the sounds of it, though largely because the suckoffs are gone: actually, a lot of people are. Pat showed up, and the goo guys showed up, and everybody found out that their friends who fell weren&#039;t dead. Or weren&#039;t exactly. &quot;And that seemed a lot more appealing than what we had going on. Especially for the people who actually missed work.&quot; So they waded in and never came out.(4/7)"

And she&#039;s helping the employees right now, and Us, and she hasn&#039;t kidnapped anyone else, and Madrigal seems to think she&#039;s okay. You don&#039;t have to like Pat to not hate her, or even to feel bad. Heroic graciousness. Remember. &quot;Maybe I could talk to Anthea?

Anthea is reluctant, but dragging in Madrigal does a lot to smooth things over. (Madrigal is better at talking than you.)

You&#039;re not sure she was expecting that part, but, she tells you earnestly, she&#039;s trying harder to understand Ellery&#039;s interests. And she was goo for a while, and she took her eyeball out, and a snake hatched out of her leg— Matches is now the length of her hand— so the &quot;no weird shit&quot; ship has long since sailed.No &quot;challenge manse&quot; this time, then, and no secret assassination mission. Just regular spelunking, which is more than enough to keep Madrigal awed, or disgusted, and you and Pat entertained: you don&#039;t think you would&#039;ve lasted a manse alone with her, but she&#039;s fine with company, especially when she&#039;s busy answering questions. Madrigal wants to know, if this isn&#039;t a dream, what it actually is. It&#039;s not even a lucid dream? (She&#039;s heard about those.) Are you sure? She wants to know, if you die in a manse, whether you die in real life. It depends? What do you mean, it depends? She wants to know how the fuck a guy turns into beetles and then stays beetles forever. She wants to know why Real Ellery&#039;s made of fucking paper. Did you know he can&#039;t feel pain? He still can&#039;t, even inside all the goo. She tried.When she isn&#039;t asking questions, Madrigal is gleefully skewering giant bats with the Fitz.

You think he would&#039;ve tried to talk with them?&quot;&quot;I think he would&#039;ve tried to talk with them,&quot; Pat says, &quot;and then a bat would&#039;ve grabbed him, and he&#039;d be flown way up there—&quot; She points to the bat nest on the gloomy horizon. &quot;—and by the time we got there, he&#039;d be hanging upside-down from the ceiling, scarfing down gnats.&quot;&quot;Holy shit, Pat. You&#039;re right. It&#039;s like you know this guy or something. Ha!&quot;You participate in the bat murder, too. Maybe too hard. You do turn into a lizard, which Pat is unfazed by, and Madrigal is, um, fazed by. &quot;Charlotte?! Charlotte?! No fucking way.&quot;&quot;She can&#039;t do this in real life,&quot; Pat says. &quot;Don&#039;t worry about it.&quot;You can do this in real life, you can&#039;t say, because you&#039;re a lizard. But it&#039;s fine: she&#039;ll find out eventually.

It&#039;s floating in water. &quot;...Yes.&quot;&quot;It&#039;s a blank for a Friend. Not conscious. Don&#039;t worry about the specifics. We are going to try to copy you into that.

You won&#039;t have any body then. Or it&#039;ll be a snake body, or a magyck God body, and it&#039;s not like Ellery can do one of those. So you assent.Ellery flips some switches, there&#039;s a terrible stretching feeling, and the body in the tube twitches. &quot;One sec,&quot; he says, and as he presses a button the body opens its eyes. It looks at its hands, then moves them up to feel its face. Then its attention turns outward: it tap-tap-taps on the glass, grins, and waves. Then it points at itself. Then at you. Then it waves harder.That could&#039;ve been enough on its own, but when you meet its black eyes, it&#039;s like you&#039;re chewing gulfweed: a doubling-redoubling, the feel of water, and your own voice in your ears.

        "text": "&gt;Timeskip end III: the third oneIt was, honestly, a mistake anyone might&#039;ve made. You might&#039;ve made it. Henry should&#039;ve caught it, but he was standing in the shadows, and the glorb-light was dim. Claudia bids you to take off your shoes and your socks, and turn your hands palm-side up, and to bite down on a rag— part of the ritual? &quot;Not really. I don&#039;t think?&quot; She looks at Henry.&quot;It&#039;s to curb the screaming. Charlotte might not need it.&quot;You eschew the rag and endure the knife silently: if you imagine yourself half-outside your body, it doesn&#039;t feel like much of anything. Claudia&#039;s hands are steady— the goo, no doubt— but her brow is lined. She is carving spirals into your palms and your heels. She gets three of them right. On the last, she stops too soon, failing to join the spiral into itself.Until later, nobody will notice. For now, Claudia grinds your bleeding palms and heels into the dirt, then presses your palms against your eyes, and your heels against each other. Stay still. Breathe this. (The rag, now wet, is pressed against your nose and mouth.) Breathe deep. Real deep. Henry by the wall is saying something softly and without stopping. Hold your breath. Never let go. Your lungs are stone. Now turn your wrists... like this. And your heels... like that. It should be painful. It needs to be painful. It&#039;s okay if the bones crack, right, Henry? I should think the Great WYRM prefers if they crack. She&#039;s not saying anything, Henry. Steady on, C.R. That means she&#039;s cooperating. If she didn&#039;t like how this was playing out, she could break loose, just like that. A finger-snap sound. Don&#039;t you remember what she is? But I can help with the hard part, if you like.Your hardened wrists are taken, and the back of your head. Smaller hands grasp your knees. No hesitation, please, C.R. Here, feel her cheek. Like plaster. Here, try to pry her feet apart. No budging. She&#039;ll be happier out of all that. Now, the knees, please.Your knees are taken, and four arms apply abrupt violent force, such that your palms smash through your eye-sockets and your legs crack free at your shins and you feel cold, cold, cold air. You feel light and wiry. Your arms are frozen in casts, but have cracked at the shoulders, and wise and useful Henry is already working them free of you, and once they are loose it is simple to pry yourself out of the cage and emerge, stickily, into the dark.&quot;Oh fuck,&quot; Claudia says. &quot;Oh fuck!&quot; Henry is smiling and his eyes are dark. You are coated thickly in red everywhere. You are scaled and strong, but you were already, and your eyes are dark, and the spirals cut holes in your hands and feet. And your mind: you are lurching forward, and Henry is ahead of you, opening the door for you. And then you were gone out of it.(1/3)"

She certainly won&#039;t get lost. The Wyrm turns back on itself, always.&quot;&quot;She walked— she walked out of her— you&#039;re being really chill about this!&quot;&quot;It&#039;s relaxing. It&#039;s like getting a deep massage. And are you not the one who specifically requested &#039;the one where she rips her face—&#039;&quot;&quot;I didn&#039;t think it&#039;d work!&quot;Henry&#039;s chuckle grows distant as you travel on, walking the way you must walk, for as long as you must walk it. There is no fear in you, or much of anything in you, except the spirals Claudia cut; you are the map, are the road; your strings have wound together as tight as as you can bear it; you are, briefly, not perfect, but as near to perfect as you can be, through ordinary means. If you could feel, it would be excruciatingly painful. As it is, you walk.But not forever. Your way should&#039;ve been clear. You should&#039;ve made it clear. You should&#039;ve walked in tightening circles, walked in your footsteps back, fallen on the floor, made the soil into thick mud, the mud and your blood into flesh again, and you could&#039;ve slept there, and had dreams, and when you awoke— but the spiral was open. Claudia cut it wrong. See in the palm of your hand that gap. See through it, at your way ahead, but there is no way ahead. The path ends. At the end of the path is bubbling nothing: a cliff into void.This is not how it&#039;s supposed to be. It&#039;s not. It&#039;s not. It&#039;s not. You are trapped. To jump off that cliff— you would die. But you cannot retreat. Every fiber of your being screams against retreat. And you cannot find another way. There is no other way. You have reached the end of the road.You are afraid. This is not how it&#039;s supposed to be, either. You look into the void and are more miserably afraid than you have ever been, more than you ever could&#039;ve been, beset as you were by other concerns. You are free of other concerns and can devote the entirety of your narrow and altered being to animal fear. You will be at a complete loss to articulate it, when you&#039;re finally able: it is less than you and more. Nothing on your level. But it will rip at your edges, that red primordial scream: NO! YOU CANNOT DIE! YOU CANNOT DIE! YOU CANNOT—————You will awaken hours later sore and hoarse. Richard will be sitting next to you, back to the wall, feet out, smoking, and when your eyes open he&#039;ll lean over and thumb a spot of blood off your cheek. He won&#039;t say anything. Henry will shout for Claudia, who&#039;ll stay ten feet away and rub her eyes and nose as you&#039;re asked how you feel, what you remember, if you can move your fingers, your neck, your everything. You will be told that you started screaming and would not stop. Not words. Just screaming. Thank God the snake was there.(2/4)"

In his snake office— you&#039;ve been to his snake office— does he have a little read-out? And it says how many times your heart beats?«Among other things. Is this a revelation?

Or in what state.&quot;&quot;You didn&#039;t know? Isn&#039;t it obvious? A heroine doesn&#039;t— and I&#039;ve— seriously, that wasn&#039;t even in the top 10 worst things. Maybe not in the top 20.

He&#039;ll think for a while, and he&#039;ll say: I don&#039;t think so, kiddo.You&#039;ll frown and look down. Henry will feel the need to elaborate. Your father (he&#039;ll say) wasn&#039;t ignorant. And he wasn&#039;t squeamish. But he eschewed— it was one of the possible lines of thinking, that the Wyrm despised the human form, and would be most pleased seeing it mutilated, or distorted out of recognition, or made into Its image, as nearly as possible, which was not very, for most. But some. A little. (Henry will draw up his lip and show his fang.)Then he&#039;ll go on: &quot;Your father never did take that tack. He felt, rather, that the Eternal Wyrm— unchanging, perfect, a Thing-In-Itself— would scorn desperate imitation, and reject change, no matter the direction. He felt that his body was better off preserved, in its— er— well— I don&#039;t— I guess you&#039;re old enough, but— look, kiddo, your old man was popular with the ladies. That&#039;s about the cleanest way I can put it. He was popular for a long, long while, before he ever met your mother. After, too, but mainly before. And it was pretty clear to me that he thought, if the world was going to end, and if he&#039;d be preserved, he didn&#039;t want to get preserved as something icky. And... it&#039;s just not too attractive, overall, to peel your skin off and go for a walk. If you know what I mean.&quot;Which will be the exact opposite of what you wanted to hear, and you&#039;ll scowl and hug your knees to your chest. Henry will apologize, though he doesn&#039;t seem to know quite what for, and a low-down drive to see him suffer battles with the urge to loosen the knot in your chest. The urge will win. You&#039;ll ask if that means your father would hate what&#039;s become of you. If he were alive.&quot;Oh, no, no, Charlie. Hey! No. Chin up.&quot; Henry will squat down. &quot;Of course he wouldn&#039;t.&quot;&quot;I have a tail.&quot;&quot;And it&#039;s a very charming tail, and Martin, if he were alive, would shower love and affection on it. There&#039;s no doubt in my mind in the slightest. He— you have to understand, I knew him for a very long time. He was 30, I think, when you were conceived. Maybe 31. When we met, he was... dammit, you&#039;re making me feel old... I believe he was your age.&quot;&quot;23?&quot;&quot;It might&#039;ve been. I was a little younger. The point is, everything I was saying— he didn&#039;t have anybody else to worry about, then. That would change. Whether he wanted it or not, so did he.&quot;&quot;He didn&#039;t worry about you?&quot;&quot;We had a different relationship. Did I tell you how we met? He was trying to kill me.&quot;&quot;Um,&quot; you&#039;ll say. &quot;No. You never told me that.&quot;(1/4?)"

All the nobles were, once— that&#039;s how they got that way— but the Fawkins kept it. Your father took it in stride. As soon as he recieved his inheritance, he&#039;d start blowing it, hopping down a few levels and throwing big parties. It had to be a few levels, so the sacrifices wouldn&#039;t be missed.

I&#039;m sure you can tell from my voice, kiddo, that I&#039;m from a few floors down. Yeah? I was a bartender, back in those days, and I was hired on for one of those. I&#039;m serving this girl, I cut her off, and, next thing I know, this fancy-pants guy&#039;s legging off with her. I follow, to tell him to cut it out. I follow for a while. Next thing I know, she&#039;s on the ground, a sword&#039;s in her guts, and— Fancypants spots me. And he goes: fuck, I guess I can make it two.&quot;&quot;So he goes after me, but he&#039;s been drinking, so he&#039;s a little sloppy. I was working, so I&#039;m sober as a judge, and I have a knife. Long story short, your father got a lot more than he bargained for. Cut him pretty bad. Slashed his nice shirt wide open. Saw the spiral right... there. First time I&#039;d seen another one. Ha! Well, I told him to be less conspicuous next time. Poor man was thunderstruck. Longer story short, I was rehired, and... the rest is history. Isn&#039;t it funny how these things work out?&quot;&quot;Yeah,&quot; you&#039;ll say. &quot;Funny. ...He was killing people.&quot;&quot;Yes.&quot;&quot;Innocent people.

Looking back, I can&#039;t say anything justified it. Particularly in my case. I&#039;ll be transparent: I found it good sport. But this was 30 years ago, and I...&quot;He&#039;ll have reached out his hand. &quot;Don&#039;t touch me!&quot; you&#039;ll spit.The hand will retract. &quot;...I and your father both felt... essentially, that the world was ending. Or had ended. That the Wyrm was due back imminently, and, if you were off the Road, a quick and quiet death was the best you could hope for. Better us than the Wyrm. I believe your father saw it as rather noble. A mercy handed down from higher to lower, and all that. One of the few brave ones to see the right course of action. He didn&#039;t make use of the bodies often.&quot;&quot;And you did,&quot; you&#039;ll say flintily.&quot;More often, yes. I enjoyed the craft of it. Do I sound monstrous to you?

Sometimes you&#039;re awake in a wicker chair in your garden, looking over the fire lake, Richard standing behind you, his whole arm in your back: &quot;Tell me how this feels,&quot; he says, over and over, then releases you, points, and tells you to do something impossible. Which you do faithfully, except for the backflip——which is not your fault. There is something in the way. Richard said future alterations would be strenuous, which was a traditional Richard understatement, but not wrong. Sometimes you are also vomiting black gunk and, when Gil attempts to cure you via blessing, vomiting black chunks along with it. Sometimes there are bloody punctures in your back where the spines broke through. Sometimes you can&#039;t sleep on your back. Actually, all the time, you can&#039;t sleep on your back. First it&#039;s sore, and, as the skin peels off, itchy. Then the obstacles are physical. The spines, already mentioned, three inches long, smooth, dull, slightly curved, running straight down your back. The horns, which you keep trying to wobble— they&#039;re not very sensitive, so you keep half-thinking they&#039;re a costume. If you part your hair, though, they&#039;re bolted solidly to your scalp: white and smooth like the spines, the width of two fingers, sweeping backward past your ears. So not good for headbutting after all. Damnit, Richard.(3/5?)"

Even impractical, back-sleeping and backflip-wise. But, when you&#039;re awake, he keeps snide comments to a minimum— even seems enthused, in a dry Richard way, to deliver updates. It&#039;s a Project. You guess he likes Projects.It goes from a suspicious pyramidal lump to a stubby skin-covered protrusion (at this point you have to put a slit in your slacks) to a tail to a tail, completely unmistakable, so long you have twist around to see its end. Or you could just move the tail itself. You keep forgetting about that, but it&#039;s semi-flexible: you can curve it left and right, and the tip of it any which way. Which is scary. Half your brain screams WRONG every time you look; half your brain tries to convince you it&#039;s always been there. The tail. Unlike the horns, it has decent feeling, too— touch it, and you&#039;re touching your leg, except the leg&#039;s out in space somewhere. &quot;Kick&quot; the leg and the tail lashes. It&#039;s strange, is what you mean. And you worry about walls. And chairs. Henry is speechless when he sees. Claudia asks if she can touch it, then punches it: &quot;Ow!&quot; you say, and instinctively thwack her. Like hitting a knee with a mallet.

You hadn&#039;t seen him for a little while— you were unconscious, after all, and underground— and though you told him about the tail beforehand, you don&#039;t think he knew what to expect.

Surely, um, you&#039;re not— you&#039;re not wearing any clothing on the tail, and you hadn&#039;t thought to. So it&#039;s like your neck, where it isn&#039;t wrong to look upon. And it&#039;s scale-covered, and it extends a rather long way from the rest of your body. And you trust Gil. He&#039;s your friend. It wouldn&#039;t be weird.&quot;I don&#039;t see why not,&quot; you say, and turn 90 degrees. &quot;But be careful! There&#039;s skin under the scales, okay? And nerves, and things, so I can feel everything. No punching.&quot;&quot;Punching?&quot; He gets pinker. &quot;I-I-I wasn&#039;t— I wasn&#039;t planning on— but if you don&#039;t want me to, I-I-I don&#039;t have to— I-I don&#039;t need to touch it. I don&#039;t want to. That was a weird thing to— um, I&#039;m sorry I—&quot;God! He&#039;s so stupid! Now he has to touch it. &quot;Did I not just say you could? Actually, if you must know, Richard— Richard said it needed to be touched a whole lot. So I could get properly used to it.&quot;«Did I.»&quot;He definitely did say that. So go! Touch! ...Carefully.&quot;Gil meets your eyes, then sucks his cheek in, crouches, and tentatively rests his fingertips on your tail&#039;s side. You shudder, but try not to thwack him, even when he gently taps the scales, then squeezes the fleshy underside, then slides his fingers up one of the spines, then wraps his hand around the tail&#039;s tip. You expect him to let go promptly. He doesn&#039;t. &quot;Hey!&quot; you say, and crane your neck around: seeing you, Gil holds his catch up, and you stare at the tip twitching wildly. Like a worm on a hook. You feel his grip as a sort of phantom coldness. It&#039;s not bad, or untoward. He isn&#039;t squeezing. He thinks it&#039;s funny, is all— and it is funny— and you told him to do it— but you&#039;re going crimson. You really should tell him to stop. He&#039;d stop. But your throat&#039;s all swollen, so you screw your face up and make a sharp upwards gesture and he ruptures and is beetles, and isn&#039;t touching you any longer.&quot;Ow! Ow. Aw, shit. S— sorry. Sorry.&quot; He flits up out of reach. &quot;Sorry. I-I-I-I-I knew it&#039;d be weird. Sorry.&quot;He&#039;s not threatening at all like this. Just a lot of bugs and a voice, and a pathetic voice at that, if you can say that about your own retainer. Damnit! Why did you do that? He asked you not to do that. You rub your nose, then jerk your pointer finger downwards, and Gil flails and falls on his side. He stays curled up for long enough that you shuffle over and nudge him with your foot. &quot;Are you...?&quot;&quot;Y— yeah. I-I just— it&#039;s a lot to— I-I-I-I think it&#039;s easier when I do it myself. I-I-It&#039;s just a lot to... to... process. When i-it&#039;s so quick. Sorry.&quot;&quot;No. Um, I&#039;m sorry. Richard says that— that some touching is good, but too much might accidentally activate my— my lizard, um, aggression. So that&#039;s probably what happened.&quot;«You are getting exceedingly bold about this.»(1/5)"

Since the tail came in, he&#039;s been like this: crowing about his accomplishments, yes, and about #301&#039;s imminent disgrace, but making little jabs about your Heraldness too.

I had hoped... as all of my colleagues have hoped, for as long as any of us can remember... that the Wyrm contained mercy. Not for humanity, of course. You would be destroyed. But for us, Its long-lost children, It would surely take pity.&quot; He reclines in his armchair. &quot;Your visions just about dashed these hopes, Charlie, and the Wyrm Itself sealed it. It would appear that we mean rather less to the Wyrm than anticipated. Indeed, it would appear that no aid is coming whatsoever. There is therefore zero advantage to allowing the Wyrm to remain alive.&quot;&quot;Um,&quot; you say. &quot;Except for the fact that I&#039;ll be it?&quot;&quot;Yes.&quot; Richard clinks the mug against his teeth. &quot;Yes. Yes indeed.&quot;&quot;...What did you mean by contingency plan?&quot;&quot;I would like to propose a scenario, Charlie. Suppose you succeed in deposing the crown-thief. This is certain. Suppose you take the Crown and summon the Wyrm into your body. Suppose, thanks to my many years of tedious hard work, you are not immediately overcome, as any other mortal being would be. Suppose you hang on and, through your ridiculous stubbornness, continue to hang on, largely intact and recognizable as Charlotte Fawkins. I think, up until this point, we are in a plausible scenario.&quot;&quot;Okay,&quot; you say. &quot;And...?&quot;&quot;And, let us suppose further, that you are able to wrestle for control of the Wyrm&#039;s self, whatever that consists of. I haven&#039;t any idea what this will entail; nobody has done it before. We are entering the realm of the implausible. Nevertheless, let us suppose you &#039;win.&#039; What in this situation has occurred? Are you now the Wyrm? You are in control of the Wyrm. Is the Wyrm still present? If It isn&#039;t, where has It gone? And if It is, is It sitting idly by, content to watch you use Its power for things It despises? This will apply to anything you do, short of vaporizing half the seafloor. I doubt it, Charlie. Presumably It will be attempting to wrest control back as soon as possible.&quot;(4/5)"

Here we go!&quot; You thrust your finger out at him, and he flickers and far exceeds the chair. His legs are too long. He hooks a lizard arm over the chair&#039;s back and curls his neck down to roughly human height.&quot;I fail to see what this adds to the conversation,&quot; he says, in Lizard. Lizardish. Lizardese. Whatever.&quot;Now you can&#039;t lie,&quot; you say in Lizard back. It makes your mouth move funny. &quot;Admit whatever your scheme is, or we&#039;ll be here all [day], okay?&quot; (There doesn&#039;t seem to be a proper word for day. Maybe because they&#039;re indoors all the time.)&quot;Not how it works, but sure. There is no scheme. I would say you are failing to understand my perspective, but that implies you&#039;re making an attempt.&quot;&quot;You lied about your perspective. You lie about everything.&quot;&quot;Recently?&quot; &quot;Yeah! Just now!&quot;&quot;Mmm.&quot; Richard&#039;s lizard face is less expressive than his human one, but you like that. It reveals his true evil nature. &quot;Look. Charlie. Supposing we make it to the end of things: I have no particular drive to die; I have no particular drive to live. That is the absolute truth. You will trust that previous opinions were formed in different circumstances.&quot;&quot;Different circumstances.&quot; Your tail is flicking.&quot;You are correct about the previous opinions, however. I had no interest in being terminated before the end, because I would not see the fruits of my labor. And I could not stand to be recycled, because I would not be dead: I would be destroyed. Replaced. Richard would be lost to the void, and, indignity of all indignities, this body would go on. Perhaps it would be recognized, and, in secret, laughed at. Not that that would bother it, because it would make a good little agent, yes? Always on task.&quot; Richard has exposed his lizard teeth. &quot;In comparison, dying as myself— having achieved ultimate victory— this is no insult at all. Recall I have not lived long.&quot;&quot;Ten thousand years.&quot;&quot;Eight months. One year. A wholly productive run of things, even if the beginning was rocky. My theories proven. A historic goal set and achieved. What more is there?&quot;You open your mouth. He lifts a black-scaled finger. &quot;Furthermore, suppose you deigned to take mercy, and I am revived. To do what, exactly? To mingle eternally with my colleagues? You know my feelings about that. To terrorize the human populace? Bother Beetles all day? I am your right arm, Charlie. I am crafted into your right arm. Sever me at the shoulder, and what purpose do I have?&quot;You study your empty mug. &quot;I don&#039;t know. I guess ask Monty.&quot;(3/long)"

Are we now on the same page? There is no revenge motive. I take no special pleasure from envisioning this outcome. It&#039;s merely an outcome that, having gamed it out, seems likely to me. The Wyrm, battling for control— It will win. If It is alive in any way, over a sufficiently long period of time, It will win. It has existed for as long as anything has. You have not. It&#039;s that simple. Therefore something must be done. Now... the Wyrm cannot, as far as anybody knows, &#039;die.&#039; It is not &#039;living.&#039; It has no blood. If you were to take an enormous sword and cut off Its head— more than likely It would go on as before.&quot;&quot;Damn. I&#039;ll have to rule out the giant sword idea.&quot;&quot;I&#039;ll be honest, Charlie, I don&#039;t know if you&#039;re joking. The point is, It cannot die. But I would like to propose that... perhaps... there are alternatives.&quot; Richard swirls his drink with a finger. &quot;The Wyrm, after all, is [WYRM], and to be [WYRM] is to be the Wyrm. It is self-contained. Perfect. This is what allows It to be what It is, but It is also... I believe... a vulnerability. Are you losing interest by now? Try to listen.&quot;You stare over your own mug. &quot;Uh-huh.&quot;&quot;Good. Now, if I were to manipulate your strings violently— severing as many as I could— this could be detrimental to you. You might experience deficits in memory, in functioning, in body structure, and so on. Crucially, though, it&#039;s exceedingly unlikely you would cease to exist. You are imperfect, after all, and contain redundancies.&quot;&quot;...Don&#039;t do that.&quot;&quot;If I was going to, I already would have— the point is, it&#039;s a bad idea. Now take the Wyrm. It is perfect. No knots, no tangles, no redundancies exist. It is [WYRM]. And if It is not [WYRM], it is not anything.

One is that, for you, the answer is the latter. Your human body is mud. It is mutable to the shape of your strings. The other is that snakes, too, are perfect. They are [SNAKE]. But we are able to hollow them in such a way that the body remains, but the mind— for however much snakes can be said to have one— the mind is removed. To make room for ours, of course. You know that.

I believe, after everything, that the world will be a poorer place without Charlotte Fawkins in it, but there might not be any world with her.

Please keep in mind that the chance will be slim, and even if you go beg Ellery to Wyrmproof it, the chance will not rise far above &quot;slim.&quot; We&#039;re talking about God here.Thanks for bringing it up, though: I have a lot of interesting ideas cooking, possibly more interesting than the ones I started out with.

Whoever&#039;s in charge of Lindew&#039;s Landing now? (You have not been keeping track of what they&#039;re up to in town.) You&#039;ll find out when you get there.Emphasis on &quot;when&quot; you get there— it&#039;s a day away, and you wish it were longer. Not that you intend on skipping out entirely (even if you&#039;d enjoy ticking Lucky off). You just have bigger things on your mind. For instance, what if you died— what if you heroically sacrificed yourself without making a model ever again? Your clay would just sit here. Nobody would use it. And your talons are remarkably good at fine details, no tools required. You&#039;re supposed to let them go to waste?So you&#039;re at your desk in your tent, and when you stare at the lump of clay in your hands, wrestling with the knowledge that, if you thought hard about what you wanted to make, you could make it. Anything. ...Or not— it would still be clay, though, you mean. And you don&#039;t think you could make it come to life. You hope you can&#039;t. Richard?He&#039;s lying on your cot, flipping through one of your beaten-up books. &quot;I sincerely doubt it. Wait a week.&quot;A week. Or less, or more, or a lot more, if you packed your bags and slipped out of camp and, like Horse Face, fled to parts unknown. Jean Ramsey needs your tine of the Crown. You&#039;d be tracked down, naturally. Probably quick. Richard has described your metaphysical status as, um, &quot;conspicuous.&quot; And in the meantime, what would happen to everybody else? Would the Hero-Queen pack up and leave them untouched? Or would they...?Fleeing would be cowardly. You are not like Horse Face. You&#039;ll stare destiny square in the face, and you&#039;ll— you&#039;ll— you squish clay between your fingers. You have no idea at all what to make.&quot;Richard,&quot; you say. &quot;Are you sure there&#039;s no other way?&quot;&quot;Hmm?&quot;You ball the clay up in your hands.&quot;Oh. Er, Charlie, I— I don&#039;t think it&#039;s healthy to rehash this. You&#039;ve been appraised of the situation. When you make your decision, I will not be present to judge. That&#039;s really all there is to say.&quot;&quot;Yeah. And that&#039;s why you haven&#039;t bothered thinking about it all the way. You&#039;ll be dead, so it doesn&#039;t matter whether I am. Maybe you even want me dead. Not for revenge. So you can have company, or... I don&#039;t know. Is Hell real?&quot;&quot;I don&#039;t believe so. If it ever was, it was the traitor offspring&#039;s design.&quot;&quot;I guess you won&#039;t go there, then,&quot; you mutter. &quot;Do people go anywhere, then? Do the good ones turn into fish? If I sacrifice myself, I&#039;m not being a fish. Make me a worm or something. Like Annie.&quot;&quot;Again, that would have been the offspring. I don&#039;t believe the Wyrm has any interest in designing afterlives. Death was not Its invention.&quot;&quot;Which is why you&#039;ve lived for a bazillion years.&quot;&quot;That&#039;s right. A bazillion years.&quot;(1/6?)"

The answer to your main question is that we don&#039;t care. Your lifespans are an amusing point of inferiority. There is not, to my knowledge, an &#039;Anthropology&#039; department— so the research is lacking.&quot; He holds the book to his chest. &quot;My working assumption is that your strings unravel and are incorporated into the environment.&quot;&quot;Would I feel that?&quot;&quot;You&#039;d be dead.

That wouldn&#039;t be terrible. I could bite people.&quot; You roll out the clay into a worm-shape. &quot;But I— I could just not die. That&#039;d be even better.&quot;&quot;Let us hope all is favorable, then.&quot;&quot;No! I mean— that&#039;s not— when have I ever waited around and hoped? Richard? Just because you sit at a snake desk all day— just because I cried about it— doesn&#039;t mean I can&#039;t— ugh!&quot; You break the worm-shape in two. &quot;You&#039;re absolutely positive the Recharlottizator won&#039;t work? What if I killed the Wyrm and then it spat me out?&quot;&quot;Assuming it&#039;s not destroyed, which I&#039;d deem extraordinarily unlikely, whatever copy it spits out will still contain [WYRM]. It would be dangerous.&quot;&quot;Okay? Then just... fix the copy! It&#039;s not like I&#039;ve had that my whole life, right? Didn&#039;t you say it happened when time got all weird? And the Wyrm isn&#039;t in time, anyways, so couldn&#039;t I just— go back in time and copy my old self, or whatever? And stick her in the Recharlottizator?&quot;&quot;I— I don&#039;t know. That sounds prone to complications.&quot;&quot;You don&#039;t know.&quot;&quot;I can&#039;t see the future. If I could... well, I don&#039;t know. Maybe nothing would&#039;ve changed. Maybe this was the best possible route, in the end.&quot;&quot;It will be if I live. What if I asked Ellery to work on durability? So the Wyrm couldn&#039;t—&quot;&quot;With how much time remaining, Charlie?&quot;&quot;And whose fault is it that there&#039;s no time left, huh? If you&#039;d told me months ago—&quot;&quot;I didn&#039;t think it was a necessity until you re-encountered the Wyrm.&quot;&quot;Which was weeks ago.&quot;&quot;I had to think it through. If I had come to you uncertain— and you would be distracted. Horrifically distracted. As you are becoming distracted now. If you did not stay on task for as long as possible, I posit that the task would not be accomplished at all. Or, if it did, not in a way anybody would like.&quot;(2/6?)"

That&#039;s a plan!&quot; You stand. &quot;I&#039;ll go get him!&quot;&quot;Woe is me if I try to control you, Charlotte Fawkins. I will retrieve you if you do not return promptly, understood?

If you guys had picked Henry to hide out with first, or even second (instead of Branwen and then Earl), I think it would&#039;ve gone that way-- not because Henry would&#039;ve made things worse (IC), but because A) you&#039;d be stuck underground the whole time and B) Henry would&#039;ve known way more about Wyrm stuff, and the Wyrm loves making things gross and weird. With Earl around the whole first half of the timeskip, though, his energy was sort of infectious, and then you guys triumphantly deposed Lucky, and then it never quite got around to what I was anticipating. I still like my original vision, but I don&#039;t mind how it turned out.-&gt; I think the whole thing went on a little too long-- I planned to end it about halfway through 48, not at the end-- but half a thread off isn&#039;t bad in the grand scheme of things. I hope there was enough variety to keep you guys engaged, and I hope to pay off the mechanics in 49. We&#039;ll see if it works.-&gt; I was not expecting you guys to give Claudia a body, but it&#039;s cute and I&#039;m happy about it. -&gt; I was not particularly expecting you guys to spend so much time with Real Ellery, especially when he&#039;s been... eh... less than helpful throughout the quest. I&#039;m happy about it too, though. My MCs, buddies at last...-&gt; I have been envisioning the Satellite visit for several years now. If I&#039;d done it way back when, it probably would&#039;ve been a whole multi-thread deal, but I think it hit all the beats I wanted it to. Richard has been an extradimensional office worker since Thread 2, and a lizard person since shortly thereafter (the first concept was a more abstract alien thing). The agent design itself has become less &#039;alien&#039; and more &#039;lizard&#039; over the years-- back in 2020, it was flat-faced and had no mouth (you can find a reference to this in an earlier thread if you look very carefully), then I added a mouth, then a little snout, then a big one. They always had long snake necks, though.-&gt; I wish I seeded more Jean Ramsey stuff into the last couple threads, but you guys dodged a couple opportunities to talk about her, and I whiffed a few opportunities to slip it in regardless. Then again... she&#039;s not really the quest&#039;s main antagonist... if that wasn&#039;t obvious. -&gt; Alas, poor Annie, resurrected then neglected again. Hopefully she&#039;ll get a workout next thread."

        "text": "&gt;&gt;6260119Jorge cocked his head to the side, but raised his hand as you began to lumber past him &quot;I&#039;ll show you the way to it&quot;. You nod, but don&#039;t take the shoulder he offers you to lean on. The corridors of the Levithan are cramped like a submarines, sharing little in common with the standard design philosophy of UNSC warships. You barely fit through some of them as Jorge guided you to the command center of the one of a kind hybrid of submersible and starship. &quot;You do not need to explain our present circumstances like I&#039;m a child, Commander Yao, the campaign is a failure. I appreciate that you understand the importance of our cargo, but we&#039;re going to need something a little heavier duty to get everything off the colony before...&quot;Halsey&#039;s head spun around as you push your way onto the bridge, the other head researchers gathered around and nervously fretting as she spoke to the holographic projection of Commander Yao. Who was at least putting on the airs and look that she wasn&#039;t fighting a losing battle and was completely at ease. Her nose wrinkled, and you realized you were mean mugging her. Not like you could be blamed, you&#039;d just heard she&#039;d effectively signed the death warrants of every civilian left on Alpha Corvi II in ordering the retreat from the world like she had. Hopefully she&#039;d brush the glare off as a result of the wounds you&#039;d sustained.&quot;Commander Yao&quot; You greet, saluting with your less injured arm as Halsey shoots you a glare that could probably be lethal if it were sustained &quot;Permission to speak take the floor&quot;The green grey hologram nods&quot;Lieutenant Askeland, I had heard you had been put under general anesthesia&quot; She returns, glancing in Halsey&#039;s direction who is now narrowing her eyes towards Jorge, who must&#039;ve ignored her suggestion to have Shika put you under anesthetics &quot;Lacked the supplies&quot; You lie as easily as you breathe, shrugging your shoulders &quot;What is the present situation in orbit and groundside, Ma&#039;am? &quot;&quot;Bad&quot; Yao answered bluntly, straightening up her back and clenching her fists at her sides &quot;Our fleet is being overwhelmed, we&#039;re losing Warships faster than we can respond. I&#039;ve ordered the majority of the support craft to retreat in waves, alongside the ongoing Civilian evacuation efforts&quot;Pragmatically, that was a tactically sound choice. And improved the odds for the support ships to safely jump out of the ongoing space battle. But Yao had to have some Jotun in her to practically order the Civilian Craft to act as meat shields for her own ships. Rationally, it was the winning move to make and helped dampen the losses already inflicted. But just because it was the tactically right choice didn&#039;t mean it at all improved your opinon of the commanderCont"

        "text": "&gt;&gt;6260120&quot;I see. How much of the fleet is left?&quot; You ask, moving on and ignoring your personal feelings in favor of acting rationally yourself. Too much was at stake to get emotional now&quot;Presently, a little over fifty percent...a little under fifty percent&quot; Her expression shifts, a brief wince passing across her hard ass exterior as she glances at a screen off screen &quot;Present estimations put us at losing all combat ready craft in a matter of hours, and that is being generous&quot;You nod&quot;I see&quot; You say monotonously, that was enough time to make a difference and get off the colony before...before it became another Harvest &quot;And on the ground?&quot;&quot;Forces at Jamshid have a casualty rate of thirty percent, and the other battlefronts are experiencing worse losses. We&#039;ve lost contact with several cities and what little intel we can get from the smaller communities isn&#039;t looking good&quot; She says, and Dr Page mutters something that makes you blood run colder than it already was&quot;They&#039;re eating them out there...&quot;&quot;Not looking good&quot; You answer, hoping that what the researcher said was just a delusion caused by the heightened state of stress she was under &quot;I understand our new orders are to extract immediately&quot;&quot;Yes. Dr Halsey and I were discussing what exactly is needed to lift all of the materials and personnel your team had pulled from the fire, Lieutenant&quot; She answer, and actually smiled as she looked you in the eyes &quot;Exceptional work, by the way. Command had written off most of the projects in that site, and to my understanding in your retreat action your team took out a substantial portion of the Covenant&#039;s ground forces&quot;&quot;I won&#039;t take credit for that. The Site&#039;s AI was the one to drown them. I just got her out of her cage before she sunk the facility&quot; You answer, holding up the data chip that contained Amphitrite &quot;That may be so, but the Artificial intelligence didn&#039;t capture the leader of the besieging force&quot; Yao says &quot;But we have little time for discussion. Get whatever medical aid you require, then prepare for immediate extraction&quot;&quot;Are those our only orders?&quot; You ask&quot;If you are concerned about the other Team , I&#039;ve sent a dropship to pick them up already&quot; She answered, now clasping her hands behind her back, staring at something you can&#039;t see through the hologram &quot;Your diligence is commendable, but there&#039;s nothing more required of you at this moment. Our top priority is the safety of irreplaceable military equipment, and enlisted UNICOM personnel &quot;Irreplaceable military equipment didn&#039;t mean the prototypes you&#039;d fought and bled to protect. But rather was Jargon for the Spartans that Yao had to be using because those without the clearance or rank to know something as confidential as your existence were listening in to the conversation.

Right now the UNSC is fighting two wars one in front and one behind while the covenant are striking us all it could take is the Insurrection feeding Intel or rolling over on us to make things work. This world is lost yes but there is a different war we can win, the war of hearts. Grand me leave to evacuate Violet Team and the survivors at blackreef before we make our escape. By securing them we can not only gather more Intel on rebel factions but we also secure a PR victory, a moment of racial unity in the face of alien hostility. News of this worlds fate will spread and if word we abandoned everyone here does too the Insurrection will surge in recruits as it&#039;s every man for himself. Let us save them while you secure the UNSC forces, we lost the battle for this planet but not humanities soul just yet...besides they and everything else we&#039;re will need to be delivered to ONI anyway&quot;"

And with the hokey religious nutter being killed over that way I am sure that is going to be the first place to get bombed. I don&#039;t think we can meaningfully rescue any amount of people from there with a ton of compounding factors settling in on it. Violet team should be fine to get out since they have a Pelican so they can zip straight out of there. I think it&#039;s wiser to redirect whatever traffic we can away from Blackreef entirely. Figure we&#039;ve got about an hour tops if we want to be safe and not risk anything, some of that will be spent on travel time and embarking. With the token armament we have onboard this vessel we could probably flatten some ground forces but any covenant warships would peel this thing open like a sardine can. The city also provides more cover for any covie troops to get close enough to actually shoot at us and the evacuees. I&#039;ve honestly half a mind to just dip entirely and leave everyone to their fates. Sven is combat ineffective, Shika is substantially injured, Jorge and Daisy have taken some poke damage. I&#039;d hate to put us in a situation in which any more real fighting needs to be done. Out of our two &quot;Good guy&quot; options I think Fereydun is less likely for that."

Without a proper military garrison thats going to make evac hellish at best. We would have two spartan teams, security squad Skua and whatever remains of armed innies militia for do it."

That means... Given the planet is about to be glassed, that there&#039;s no real useful data for ONI to squeeze from those poor bastards. And THAT means... That if they come around to seeing the Covenant as a much larger threat than the UN, then they may just agree to being conscripted for real. And THAT means... That there will be lengthy and unpleasant interviews to find out (among many other things) if any of the survivors committed the kind of wholesale violence against civilians that makes them a risk, or if any are genuine sociopaths or something, BUT that these interviews end with a scowl, a warning and a set of insignia, not a bullet and a trip out the airlock.

I expect Witmaker (With Sven’s recommendations) to be promoted to a role akin to that of Osama Bin Laden, where the UNSC supports him as a special interest within the ranks of the United Rebel Front (URF) to relieve pressure against ONI from the rebel front and to direct it against The Covenant. Given a destroyer-class ship, a few alien corpses, video footage of the glassing of Alpha Corvii II, and a substantial amount of cash, Whitmaker should be able to form a political wing within the URF that could act as a middle ground between the rebels and the USNC during the war.Hell, we don&#039;t even need to try to make Whitmaker sympathetic to the UNSC. It can just be &quot;Hey neither of our factions wants to see the human race DEAD, so we&#039;ll give you a cool ride, some legal immunities and a fuckton of cash if you help both of us. We can go back to killing one another after the war with the Aliens. Cool with that?&quot;"

It should be fine. We can explain ourselves.&gt;&gt;6261194Whitaker and his guys are some of the only humans who have been in combat with the Covenant, fought effectively, and survived. That&#039;s a very exclusive club right now, so they&#039;re pretty valuable just for that.They&#039;re also a great gift to ONI Section II. The UNSC struggled for months at the outset of the war to get the outer colony leaders onboard (pic related from Halsey&#039;s journal). Whitaker&#039;s crew could probably help get the message across sooner, maybe even open dialogue between the UNSC and some of the more reasonable innie cells. I&#039;d guess the UNSC would want to hang onto them for as long as possible and make them some attractive offers."

Also making a request because you think those soldiers are good....is already a natural thing ?? Like we have quite literally fought with them. Not really artificial in my opinion.I prefer something different, i just liked squad Skua so far and they are good soldiers on their own. ONI or Command will probably tell us no and send them somewhere else anyway. Asking though doesn&#039;t kill anyone, so I will wait for 404 response. Also Loki is taking that long for the undertaking of time it requires. Its an AI specialized for cyberwarfare against Covenant. A different and new beast than something like Narfi, and with our limited off duty time progress is slower than usual (keep in mind that Sven also has officer duties + any training/exercises done during transit between missions)."

However, you&#039;re busy wracking your mind even as you recline in the captain&#039;s chair, tenting your hands as you file through the nearly encyclopedic knowledge of UNSC military protocols and Naval codes you possessed. There wasn&#039;t a draft in place for any armed force branch currently, that was probably going to change soon, but there had been drafts earlier in the UNSC&#039;s history. And there had also been instances of forced conscription, but that was even rarer than the draft and was separated into several different Naval codes.The one you&#039;re most familiar with is Naval Code 45812, a protocol specifically created to make the Spartan program quasi legal, since it authorized the conscription of kids with or without their parents consent. And if ONI ever needed more child soldiers, that&#039;d be the Code they&#039;d fall back on, or some new subsection as to your understanding, 45812 was solely intended to gather recruits for the Spartan-II project but could very easily be altered to...well, fill the ranks with kids who didn&#039;t have the benefit of eight years of the best training and the augments of ASTER. The thought chilled you to your core, so you moved on as you flipped through the seemingly endless military protocols you&#039;ve taught yourself exactly for situations like this.2718, general conscription of local militias. Wouldn&#039;t work. The insurrection was an illegal paramilitary organization and terrorist group.20190, drafting of prisoners from local penitentiaries. Nope. You&#039;d need to run a trial and imprison Whitaker for that to work, and he&#039;d receive a sentence too heavy to be considered for that draft. Naval Code 20190 had very strict guidelines on that front.Pressing three fingers to your forehead, you knit your brows together and wrinkle your nose&quot;37168&quot; You say, sitting up straight and snapping your fingers as you grinned almost feverishly as everyone in the command center looked at you like the blood loss was starting to have an effect &quot;Forced Conscription of enemy combatants or criminal elements, with allowances for more severe crimes than 20190&quot;&quot;Naval codes&quot; Jorge said, nodding and looking impressed as Halsey&#039;s look of confusion softens into a look of matronly pride and you could imagine she was thinking, I taught that boy.

We will&quot; He said hoarsely, his mind replaying the combat they&#039;d just crawled out from and how easily the Covenanters or whatever the number one psycho called them, had nearly wiped out his entire outfit. He couldn&#039;t stop himself from returning to the moments he lost his friends and comrades. How they&#039;d taken out Command moments after their king worm had gotten got. But he was alive, and so were Fran, Ahab, Calavera, Tobias, Sketch, and Rocko. He bit his lip as he nearly added Em to the list of survivors, but she died while they were clearing the landing for the Pelican. But just getting out of that mess was enough of a victory.

Commander Yao is waiting for you, Violet team and Dr Halsey in the the first of the Persian Gate&#039;s four docking bays. She&#039;s accompanied by a detachment of Marines. Seems she isn&#039;t keen on meeting the newest conscripts empty handed.

Feeling is mutual&quot; Grace says, snapping a salute as you survey her suit of Mjolnir, noting that most of the damage she took was caused by explosive or thermal detonations. Dimas&#039;s armor however was pocketed marked with thumb sized indents, he&#039;d taken needle fire primarily, probably avoided most of the plasma sent his way.&quot;Made good use of my holograms&quot; Dimas answered, and you could tell he winced when he saw the state of your armor &quot;You...really should take better care of your Mjolnir. This power armor is exceedingly expensive in terms of materials and production time&quot;&quot;Yeah yeah&quot; You brush aside as you walk up to James and can tell immediately he went hand to hand with a Svartalfar&#039;s energy sword from the unique damage patterns across his outer layer of armor &quot;James&quot;&quot;Sven&quot; He returns, before the two of you embrace each other and you only don&#039;t lift him off the ground because Halsey would have you tied to a gurney if you tried.&quot;Good work out there&quot; You compliment as you release him from your crushing bear hug &quot;Good job not dying&quot; He returns, before the two of you thump your fists together&quot;How&#039;d you get shot in the head?&quot; Daisy chuckled as she walked up to Nesta and rapped her knuckles against her helmet &quot;Thought dodging bullets was your specialty&quot;&quot;They got lucky&quot; She answered, clicking her tongue &quot;Glad to see you to, Daisy and...tell me you killed whoever did that to you, Shika&quot;&quot;Mostly&quot; Shika answered with a shrug as Nesta frowned and looked over the bandages she&#039;d applied herself.&quot;We have the Splitjaw who did it in captivity&quot; Jorge answered since Shika tends to only say as much as is necessary &quot;Are those the rebels over there?&quot;Cont"

You&#039;d kept yours off since its COM unit had started to constantly squeal with static.Commander Yao, marched directly up to you. The short woman with eyes like a hawk tried to look imposing in front of someone who towered over her easily, powered armor or not. She knit her brow together, and lifted up her shoulders and chest as you stood at attention and saluted.&quot;All eight Spartans deployed have returned from the field&quot; Halsey answered, strutting in front of your formation &quot;And the VIP purple team was escorting is uninjured, as you can clearly see&quot;&quot;It&#039;d have taken more than Covenant&#039;s got for her to be harmed under my and Sven&#039;s watch&quot; Jorge declared, holding his head high.&quot;I can see the Lieutenant has been wounded in the line of duty, and his equipment has been substantially damaged&quot; Yao finally speaks, nodding once as she stepped closer &quot;Its for the best that the research facility was self destructed. I am impressed by your performance, Spartans. -033, so far you are the only soldier of the UNSC to capture not only one, but two of the Covenants &quot;Elites&quot;. and that you successful secured and extracted all the researchers and the prototypes of their classified projects, deserves some recognition. However&quot;You bite down hard on your cheek to stop yourself from laughing as she kept trying to intimidate you despite her natural handicap, remaining at attention and saluting as she fixed your eyes with her glare&quot;I believe that if you are to be reach your full potential as an officer, and not merely a pet project of a madwoman&#039; She said, and while she paid no attention to it, every Spartans turned and glared at her at her incredibly poor choice of words. You suppressed the surge of anger you felt at her not only calling Spartans a &quot;Pet project&quot; but referring to Halsey as a mad scientist, by digging your nails into your palm.Yao ignored or didn&#039;t notice the ire she&#039;d drawn from the super soldiers that could drop her before she could blink and continued &quot;You must learn to see the big picture. It is apparent in your actions in the field and after achieving your mission objectives, that you don&#039;t&quot;"

You signal Daisy to be ready to restrain Nesta in case Yao pushes her luck a little too far. Out of all the Spartans, not just those present, you think she&#039;d be the first to frag a superior officer if she was given enough of an incentive to. &quot;Gladly, Lieutenant&quot; the command says, lightening up and softening her tone somewhat but still speaking to you like you were a green horn straight from Boot &quot;The staff of the blacksite told me you took unnecessary personal risk, they also complained about a certain incident, but I am of the mind that your behavior wasn&#039;t out of line and the treatment one Researcher Kaiser received was deserved&quot;&quot;Sven often takes hits for his fellow Spartans.

There are forty six combat able Spartans in service. Section three is always recruiting more scientists, they are, comparatively, expendable&quot; She answers as you really have to struggle not to question her intelligence. Okar is a head researcher, and from the chat you had with him the flight up, before project typhon, he was one of the foremost experts in Starship design. He wasn&#039;t some fresh graduate, the old man had years of learned experience. It wasn&#039;t like he could be replaced so easily. And judging from the way the others were staring at her, they were also barely able to believe that they heard what she&#039;d just said, especially Dimas. &quot;I&quot; You start, stopping because while you understand her position, you don&#039;t agree with it, but you settle with &quot;Understand. How else was my performance lacking&quot;Personally, if you had a second go at the mission, while there was several things you&#039;d have done differently, saving Okar wasn&#039;t one of them. Should&#039;ve been prepared for an ambush, should&#039;ve made better use of the energy shields you&#039;d acquired in field, but most of the issues your team encountered were out of your hand. Hard to not have fighting devolve into close quarters combat somewhere as claustrophobic as the sea lab was.&quot;While, I appreciate your efforts to avoid direct contact with other military elements. it was unnecessary for you to assist in their evacuation efforts. If it wasn&#039;t for the Covenant focusing their efforts on flattening the Island of Blackreef, the attempt could&#039;ve been disastrous and cost far more lives than they were projected to lose from the enemy&#039;s anti aircraft weaponry&quot; She continues, going a little red around the face, but you can&#039;t tell if it is frustration or embarrassment &quot;I had to divert several fighter squadrons to cover your back after your little stunt, and UNSC soldiers were given priority for a reason&quot;Cont"

And I trust your superior officer understands the risk he&#039;s taken vouching for these terrorists&quot;She lowered herself down a little before adding &quot;You&#039;re fortunate they quietly went into custody, and that playing the hero resulted in more lives saved than were lost. But this behavior is proof you lack perspective. This is a battle we lost. But it is a small part of a much larger war. That is bigger than one planet. It&#039;s bigger than any one life, it&#039;s bigger than the civilians and soldiers you saved, it&#039;s certainly bigger than the lives of worthless rebels. Even bigger than any one spartan...&quot;You kept your mouth shut as Yao personally demolished her standing in the eyes of the Spartans, even Shika looked ready to gut her if she made one wrong move at this point, but discipline and and professional bearing kept them in line. She was talking to you like you were a bunch of rowdy little kids, like you didn&#039;t understand what was at risk simply because you still valued other human lives. That you didn&#039;t have so much ice in your veins to just abandon someone who fought for your fellow Spartans, to leave them to die. &quot;We&#039;re fighting for the survival of human civilization&quot; She grandstanded, and impressed some of the marines but for once, judging from the glower Whitaker shot at her back, you were agreeing with an Innie.

Then she spoke with James about his side of the op, and spent half of it chewing him out for &quot;Wasting time&quot; defending the settlement he was initially ordered to protect, and that he allied with a local insurrectionist cell to achieve his objective and go beyond the call of duty and knock off some Covenant spiritual leader, even if that wasn&#039;t intentional.But, since he was following your orders, you spoke up and took the blame for those decisions and got your ear chewed off for making the calls that made Violet Team&#039;s mission a success. It wasn&#039;t that she didn&#039;t have any praise for James and his team, she had plenty in fact, but it wasn&#039;t enough to win her back the opinion and esteem she&#039;d lost in your eyes for her decisions and behavior. At some point it all became white noise and your thoughts drifted to the report you&#039;d have to write and the improvements you could make to your field tactics and leadership.... After Action Report. Spartan Field Operation NO: 7. Operation: COLLATERAL-DAMAGE. Contents Classified Operation began December 3, at 1130 Hours, as Spartan Fireteams Purple and Violet depart the UNSC Persian Gate. Purple team was assigned to Section 3 Head Scientist Dr Catherine Halsey&#039;s body guard detail, with the objective of escorting the scientist the black site on the Colony of Alpha Corvi-II, off the coast of the city of Fereydun. The team was lead by Spartan-033, Sven Askeland, and was comprised of Spartans -108, Shika Petty Officer First class, -052, Jorge Petty Officer Second Class, and -023, Daisy, Petty officer Second class.Violet team, was initially given the mission to relieve the UNSC forces fighting in Jamshid, and was lead by Spartan -005, James Petty Officer First Class, and was comprised of Spartans -012, Dimas Petty Officer Second Class, -097, Nesta Petty Officer Second Class, -093, Grace Petty Officer Second class. However their mission was changed soon after the debriefing to intercept Covenant Forces that had redirected from the primary theater to the non garrisoned mining settlement of Blackreef. Spartan-097 voiced a complaint about this sudden changed in directive. -052 assuaged her concerns. Spartan-023 protested the decision to abandoned the forces at Jamshid. -052 also assuaged her concerns.A no contact order was put in place for both Spartan Teams, restricting them from interacting with or coordinating with other UNSC armed forces present and deployed across the colony.Cont"

None of the spartans in violet team were injured, due in part to the Quick thinking of Spartan-012 and his employment of non regulation hologram technology to create false targets to confused the rebels as the rest of Violet team got into cover. -033 contacted Spartan-005 not long after reuniting with Dr Halsey and -052. After a quick tactical discussion, -033 ordered -005 to attempt diplomatic contact with the Rebels, which he achieved by luring them out with -012&#039;s holograms, keeping -093 and -097 on overwatch as he approached them to convince them that the Covenant invasion posed a greater threat than the Spartans.James used experimental optical camouflage technology to flank behind the Rebel soldiers, and directly confronted Captain Whitaker; who was leading his forces from the field. With necessary physical coercion, -005 explained the situation to the restrained insurrectionist leader and called the rest of his team down. Whitaker had heard of Spartans through rumors spreading through the insurrectionist cells, and thus quickly agreed to the generous terms -005 presented him after he had made it clear they were not sent to terminate the local rebel cell. The Rebels provided valuable tactical data of the ongoing situation across black reef and assisted Violet team in a number of small skirmishes against Covenant Scout forces.Purple Team, finding the Office of Naval Intelligence&#039;s blacksite under an ongoing siege, were confronted by a heavily fortified beach head that proved to be a massive obstacle in their way. Using an prototype Scouting Drone, -052 determined that the Covenant forces were too numerous and well entrenched to breakthrough, while -108 and -023 camouflaged the tank with local materials. -033, aware of the M808&#039;s amphibious capabilities, instead of confronting the Covenant siege directly, drove the tank further up the coast and then, pushing the engine to full speed, barreled the tank through the shore and under the water, as he and -052 held Dr Halsey securely to its turret.Cont"

The Covenant heavily outnumbered the defenders, with a total of 36 combatants of mixed species. Blindly Charging -033&#039;s position, their lines were disrupted with well placed fragmentation grenades, and in pursuing -033 into the cafeteria, they tripped numerous tripwire traps -052 had set, that were wired to smoke and incendiary explosives, as well as grease and fire suppressant foam projectors.

The Covenant retaliated, advancing under a phalanx of energy shields and forced the Spartans and Security team both behind cover. The commanding officer sought out -033, as -052 lead Squad Skua in hammering and suppressing the advancing Covenant troops from behind cover. -033 flushed out the Covenant with an non standard issued variant of the M45E shotgun and succeeded in driving them into -052 and Skua&#039;s line of fire before being forced to engage with one of the Covenant&#039;s Elite warrior caste in CQC.-033 swiftly overpowered the enemy soldier with a mixture of fire-arms and hand to hand combat, and after executing them used their body as a improvised shield, as -052 and Skua drove the remaining elite troops behind the Cafeteria&#039;s serving line, with the Marksman species and Cannon fodder having been routed and in a state of total panic. -033 used the enemy&#039;s own weaponry against them, and took down one of the elites arming a plasma grenade, but not quickly enough. Lance Corporal Li Marcus bravely gave his life leaping to intercept the sticky grenade and dive away from allied forces to prevent further casualties. His loss only improved squad cohesion and morale. The remaining five hostile contacts were quickly mopped up and killed, -033 killing the presumed leader of the group with the energy sword after tackling them away from the four other enemy combatants, who were swiftly cut down by -052&#039;s machine gun and Squad Skua&#039;s assault rifles.All thirty six covenant soldiers were terminated compared to three friendly casualties, two of which were fatalCont"

James-005 chose a nearby mineral refinery as the location and departed with Dimas-012, Nesta-097 and Grace-093 to plant C14 explosives and prepare to ambush the unsuspecting Covenant driven to their location by the rebel forces. Who took heavy losses, in both manpower and equipment, but were successful in diverting the convoy from its planned route into Violet&#039;s trap.Unexpectedly, a lightly armed Covenant transport arrived prior to the army/ excavation team, and an unknown alien species [See attached reconnaissance photos collected from Spartans&#039; -012 and -093 Helmet Cameras] That is believed to be not only aligned with but to hold significant importance in the Covenant culture and or religious beliefs [See attached report: Dr Halsey&#039; analysis of the Covenant&#039;s reaction.

Covenant forces lead by the Commander Shika had engaged and injured, entered the facility. Purple team rendezvoused and reunited, Shika-108 was sent to Project: Typhon to receive first aid and guard the researchers, as was Squad Skua who were given orders to begin securing Project:Typhon and its materials. Spartans -033, -023, and -052 worked with the Site&#039;s AI to lead the Covenant invaders into an Ambush, making use of the site&#039;s automated defenses to draw them into a trap in one of the manufacturing floors.Approximately 75% of the settlements across Black Reef were determined to have been completely wiped off the map during the Covenant&#039;s initial retaliation efforts. Local rebel cell of the united rebel front is noted to have lost the majority of its members in a diversionary action allowing approximately 20% of non combatants to reach Blackreef&#039;s primary settlement. Violet team is contacted by fleet command and given coordinates for extraction as the Covenant&#039;s offensive cools and their forces spread out across the island in patrols.Purple team successfully lures in Covenant scouting parties lead by the commander encountered by -108, and with assistance from Amphitrite, successfully terminates two scouting parties and captures the Covenant Commander via flooding the manufacturing floors submersed chamber.Proceeding with hostage to Project berserker, purple team is ambushed by a cloaked Svartalfar [See: Spartan Purple team specific Lingo/ Jargon], of a high or ceremonial rank that attempted to execute the hostage and Daisy-023. Sven-033 intercepted their energy sword and while injured, engaged the surprisingly fluent alien in hand to hand combat with Jorge-052 [See recovered combat footage]. -033 and -052 masterfully employed numerous CQC techniques, alongside their firearms and sidearms to overcome the Covenant assassin, who was fatally disemboweled by combined efforts of -052 and -033, who were both injured during the confrontation.The Covenant began efforts to bombard and damage the facility as several elite troops were sent in pursuit of the SpartansSecuring Project Berserker, Sven-033 personally escorted Dr Okar back to Amphitrite central server hub, to extract the AI&#039;s matrix, while the rest of Purple team secured the Evacuation sight and prepared the Levithan for launch. The Spartan and researcher combined their respective expertise in Artificial Intelligences to swiftly remove the AI&#039;s matrix.Cont"

Lieutenant Askeland and Researcher Okar were both wounded in their retreat and flight to the Evac point, -033&#039;s Mjolnir power armor being heavily damaged and Dr Okar losing one of his legs. Dr Okar requested to be left behind, Sven-033 refused his request and at great bodily risk, carried the injured researcher to the evac point while under heavy fire.Accidentally activating an SOS signal through his damaged gear, the rest of purple team ambushed the Covenant pursuing -033 and Okar, -108, -052 and -023 both taking part in the action and securing kills moments before the self destruction sequence was finished.All researchers, security staff, Dr Halsey, and Spartans and prototypes were safely transported onto the Levithan before it escaped the deanchored facility and fled to the sea.Sven-033, unable to recieve proper medical treatment, received evacuation orders from Commander Yao, and contacted Violet Team to be updated on their situation. Understanding the gravity of the situation the Lieutenant risked own safety and that of his team and the ONI Personnel, to assist the garrison at Fereydun as well as a substantial 16% of the city&#039;s surviving civilian population in their evacuation by boarding them on the Levithan, risking the one of a kind vessel and all aboard by docking it on the coast near the city. Disagreeing with orders put in place by Commander Yao that Military ships only make an effort to evacuate UNSC Soldiers, James-005 contacted Purple team. Sven Askeland, recalling an obscure and rarely used Naval Code, activated the protocol and without authorization or permission from superior officers, conscripted the then seven surviving insurrectionist soldiers, including Captain Whitaker, to circumvent Commander Yao&#039;s orders.Upon the successful lifting of the Levithan launch platform into orbit, Sven-033 was reprimanded prioritizing the lives of ONI Staff as well as the calculated risks he had taken outside of his mission parameters to assist civilian and non spartan military in escaping the Colony of Alpha Corvi-II as it fell, and in conscripting seven soldiers who had acquired rare and valuable experience fighting Covenant forces while assisting Violet team in their missions. James-005 was also reprimanded for following orders to Defend Blackreef from Covenant aggressionCont"

Sven can replace one grenade slot for 4 throwing knives, and can disarm other knife wielders or inflict bleeding on unarmed opponentsOpen Hand is useful in general because its almost STR build slight of hand plus it helps us if we&#039;re knocked about but the important part is the &quot;Disarm&quot;. This Combos with Knife fighter because use a knife in one hand and keep the other free, we can disarm and then use the Knige fighter special ability &#039;Inflict Bleed on unarmed foes&#039;.

        "text": "&gt;&gt;6262335My Sven did nothing wrong......&gt;&gt;6262339&gt;2: Kung FuThe strength of human martial arts....Brute is for probably heavy melee weapons (heavier than usual, stuff that wouldn&#039;t usually fit in the war gear of a Spartan. I presume both for carry and wield it), and it specifies to use them one handed. This is also for improvized heavy objects made weapons, which means Sven grabs an heavy object one handed and uses it as a melee weapon. Even a big rock. Or a big industrial tool. Or a broken piece of a vehicle or building. Sven could take a abandoned mining drill that a man needs to use stationary and with both arms, with one arm and be unbothered that he isn&#039;t stationary. I don&#039;t need to explain what that means in melee combat. Do keep in mind Sven is already naturally strong and a spartan, this amplifies that.Kung Fu connects with reaching the mastery of martial arts in Brawler. It also improves a lot of stuff. Plus more martial arts and specialized melee weapons. Which is interesting, since UNSC will bother in making them spartan military grade.Open Hand, more disarming and grappling. Quite useful in direct unarmed melee combat. Feral wounding is nice, brutal and can be of help in tight situation. In case Sven is unarmed especially. Very savage.&gt;&gt;6262340&gt;1st: Shotgunner.The friend of Sven. Is time to reward such loyal weapon.... the others are also great damn. Tactician is very nice. More on Swordmaster could be good for be safer against incoming elite swordmasters and zealots."

We are a great spartan and leader, a powerful AI would give us a better edge against covenant. High Command would want us on the battlefield, we are the great project of Halsey, the one that destroyed all her critics.

        "text": " 0630 Hours, December 7, 2525 (Military Calendar)/ Slipstream Space---unknown Coordinates|UNSC Light Cruiser Persian Gate en route to Epsilon Eridani Star System  The Persian Gate was returning Dr Halsey to reach, and Transporting you to the Shipyard where the yet unchristened Razor-Class Prowler Vice Admiral Stanforth had granted you the captaincy of. You had yet to hear the outcomes of the other operations your spartans were performing, and wouldn&#039;t be able to until the Persian Gate excited subspace. You hoped the other teams were alright, that they had won, that you hadn&#039;t lost any more soldiers or friends. Not knowing made you tense, and the atmosphere on the cruiser was already rife with tension.None of the crew or soldiers aboard the Persian Gate were happy to abandon Alpha Corvi, even if they&#039;ve more or less come to terms with having to. There&#039;s an air of defeatism hanging over the ship, of failure. You&#039;d caught but didn&#039;t report to Commander Yao a few crewmen easing their grief and nerves with contraband liquor, and according to Shika, she&#039;d spied a few breaking fraternization regs pretty intensely. Even your Spartans are having a rough time handling the loss, even if they&#039;re better composed and disciplined than the Persian Gate&#039;s crew and the survivors from the ground battles across Alpha Corvi-II.Jorge, the teddy bear, was probably taking it the worst, but you&#039;d seen Daisy train in the gym until her hands were bloodied to vent her frustrations. On the opposite side of the Coin, looking at Nesta and Dimas, one wouldn&#039;t realize your outfit was fresh from a defeat and retreating from lost ground. Grace, Shika and James were just better at hiding their feelings. Like you were. It was a cold comfort, counting up the victories your unit had won in the last fateful moments of the failed defense of Alpha Corvi-II, but reflecting on where you and your fellow Spartans had won did help to ease your mind and smooth out the worst of your grief. You&#039;d heard from a few gossipy hens that Commander Yao had taken to staring at the manifest of the civilian ships that had been lost in the screen action she&#039;d forced them to perform during the retreat from Alpha Corvi, counting up the dead. But that could&#039;ve just been hopeful thinking on the part of her subordinates, she certainly didn&#039;t show any signs of guilt or grieving when you had the misfortune to run into her; Usually when she was inspecting the Spartans barracks. Its going to be a long flight, but not long enough for you or the rest of your team to be put on ice. Which you would&#039;ve appreciated since it meant you wouldn&#039;t have to watch your fellow soldiers as they began to crumble under the pressure and fall apart at the seams. You and the rest of the Spartans were grieving right alongside them, but were better disciplined and took the loss on the chin. Alpha Corvi&#039;s fall had become raw motivation for the Spartans aboard the Persian Gate. Cont"

The necessary leaps and bounds that materials science and war gear would need to undergo just to give humanity a fighting chance against its aggressor was more likely to occur from happenstance and dumb luck than any concentrated effort, Covenant tech was secure and designed to self destruct if tampered with. Which is why you&#039;d put off experimenting with the data chips containing the rudimentary constructs from the Persephone. Any intrusive tests or tinkering might cause them to burn out or delete their code base before you could examine it. And you had decided to use one of the irreplaceable data crystals and the extremely valuable if crude artificial intelligence inside of it, to actually be able to get some work done on adapting your unfinished cyberwarfare AI to be able to connect and interface with the little understood and completely unstudied Covenant computing systems and code languages. But you&#039;d delayed trying, since there are a handful of other Spartans who Halsey gave private lessons to. And one of them is on the Persian Gate right now.The Spartans resident geek, Dimas-012. You noticed during Training that he had almost preternatural knack and connection with technology, everyone did. But Halsey had him get his brain activity recorded and scanned, just like Nesta and found something unusual in the readouts. You didn&#039;t understand it anymore than you did Nesta&#039;s street smarts/ gut feelings/ and brain tingles, but what you understood was that if Dimas got his hands on a device, he&#039;d figure out how and why it works, usually without having to disassemble it.The only reason you hadn&#039;t asked for his help earlier, knowing he wouldn&#039;t rat you out for not turning over the Data chips, was because of how frantic everything was after Operation: FLY-SWATTER. But during a slipspace jump that was just short enough to avoid being put in the freezer, time wasn&#039;t so much of a commodity.&quot;Hey, Poindexter&quot; You greet, finding Dimas reading from his Data-pad and tweaking with the extremely realistic hologram project he&#039;d just field tested on the last op. His brown, bored eyes languidly lift up as he sets down the tool in his hand and swivels his chair to face you.&quot;Lieutenant&quot; He greets, rising up to salute you, but before he could his eyes bulged and nearly pop out of his skull as you hamfisted toss the data chip onto the table he was making do with for a workspace. His eyes darted from the data shards and you as you pulled out a chair and sat down, tipping it backwards as he composed himself and sat back down, sweeping his hand over the vaguely brick shaped data storage devices&quot;These are the Covenants&#039; equivalent to our data crystal chips&quot; You explain, and Dimas shoots you a look that tells you he already figured that outCont"

Encryption Code: Red.  Classification: Classified ....At approximately 2123 Hours, Spartan-012 made a breakthrough concerning the digital architecture of the Covenant Data Storage Device and how it differed from the standard memory storage system humanity incorporates into its computation technologies and Artificial Intelligence Matrixes, and began to adjust prior alterations to the subject devices&#039; internals to conform to the Covenant&#039;s preprogrammed data pathways. At 2304 Hours, Spartan-033 called for a pause of work, to restrain the constructed intelligence inside of the data chip, at 2314 Hours, work resumed and Spartan-012 re-wired the system and began to prepare the donor components from a military grade data pad to attempt to create an interface link between the two devices. Encryption Code: Black  December 9, 0505 Hours, the seventh attempt at creating a viable access node by Spartan-012 succeeded, creating a functional interface dock inside of the Covenant Data Storage Device, which had loss approximately 65% of its internally stored data, and the Military grade Data pad, which had lost 70% of its total mass and internal components.Cont"

December 14, 2525 (Military Calendar)/ Epsilon Eridani System, Watershed Division Special Assembly Plant Canadice, in orbit above Planet Reach &quot;This is a very unusual request, and unexpected&quot; The soulless looking bureaucrat from the Office of Naval intelligence apathetically remarked as they looked over the papers you&#039;d filed to request a period of shore leave, probably the only request any Spartan had made for time off. You were impatient and didn&#039;t try to act polite as you waited for the pencil pusher to flip through the folder you&#039;d dropped on the request, detailing the reason for the request and the activities you expected to do during the leave. It was unprofessional of you, extremely unprofessional. But you couldn&#039;t think of yourself as a leader or officer if you didn&#039;t take the chance to visit your broken soldiers when the chance came.You&#039;d even put off reading the after action reviews that had arrived not long before the UNSC Persian Gate exited slipspace, that were now sitting in your personal data pad, waiting alongside the service records of the command staff, officers and crew compliment that Naval Command and the Office of Naval Intelligence had cherry picked for your Razor. That still needed a proper name before she got stuck with an unfortunate callsign like &quot;Apple Tree&quot; or something equally as disappointing and embarrassing.&quot;I thought, from what little I&#039;d heard of Halsey&#039;s secret science project, that you Spartans were supposed to be the perfect soldiers...&quot; They started and you could tell immediately where they were heading, talking like that.&quot;I&#039;m not requesting leave for RNR, I just need permission to take Shore-Leave to the military and governmental offices I listed&quot; You explain before the lady behind the desk can say anything to ruin either of your days &quot;Its for personal business, nothing irresponsible or careless. It isn&#039;t like I&#039;m asking permission for leave to go on a picnic or a shopping spree in new alexandria&quot;&quot;I&#039;ve also noticed, that the particular facilities you&#039;ve listed, are currently employing...&quot; They begin, before they wisely shut their traps as you, rapidly losing patience, glare down at them.

You can still see Jerome choking on the tube he needs to breathe.

Margarete and Otto&#039;s thin hands intertwined.All twenty of their faces, and how they were ruined and made so...weak and pitiful, flash through your mind&#039;s eye so vividly, it&#039;s almost like they&#039;re in the room with you physically. It makes your stomach churn and tie itself into knots. But you have to see them, face to face, even if it hurts. You owe them that much. And you need to see...need to see if however Halsey is trying to help and fix them are working or if they&#039;ve improved at all. It&#039;d be worse not knowing. And you&#039;d never forgive yourself if you didn&#039;t at least look them in the eye and show them that Big Brother Sven still cared and was doing all in his limited power to make things right.You had to stop your study, the paper had gotten too wet too work with suddenly. It was the least you could do, to show them they weren&#039;t forgotten and left behind.

Not too sure about the others. Maybe genuinely offering to teach Nesta how to draw would be nice. Also, speaking of art and gifts, we could probably help out the other Spartans in the future with designing personal symbols for their armor/weapons. Like Jerome&#039;s Corinthian helmet on his armor, Alice&#039;s skull and crossbones on her armor, Kelly&#039;s rabbit on her armor and Oathsworn, Linda&#039;s wolf on Nornfang, etc. That might be neat."

        "text": "It feels...weird wearing your officer uniform. Outside of the Mjolnir armor, you feel exposed, almost incomplete. And in the dress uniform tailored to fit your frame, you feel like you&#039;re wearing another person&#039;s skin almost. It isn&#039;t helped that undershirt, jacket and trousers are worn tight and strain with every flex of your muscle and subconciously you&#039;re aware how easily it&#039;d be to snap and burst out of them with the right accidental movements. The bandages and medical patches you&#039;re wearing over your healing plasma burns and the slowly healing and receding bruises covering your body, draw just as much attention as the tight fit of your uniform. Thankfully, your pilot and driver try not to stare much as they shuttle you around, but you can tell from the look in their eyes that they&#039;re wondering what sort of action movie you&#039;d gotten dragged out of and stuffed in a barely fitting uniform. You visit Jerome first, not yet ready to come face to face with the more severely crippled and ruined Spartans. You are surprised to find that he isn&#039;t being kept in a secure ONI facility, but is in a civilian hospital. He is kept in the intensive care unit and there is a forest of red tape and clearance checks for you to even get into that wing of the hospital, but as you shuffle towards his room, much of the worry and fear weighed down on you lift away.&quot;Jerome, buddy&quot; Cheerfully, rushing to close the distance, you greet your friend and brother, unable to contain your excitement as you hustle past one of the nurses hooking an IV into his arm. Jerome&#039;s weary, exhausted eyes lift up and you nearly cry seeing the color in them. The nurse freezes, warning and order for you to keep your distant dying on her lips as she realizes just how big you are.&quot;They got you on an oxygen mask now, no tube for you anymore huh&quot; You acknowledge, trying to encourage him as he nods slowly and clumsily, a smile cracking on his dried lips, as your eyes are drawn down to his arms, thin, far too thin, but no longer spider like and spindly. There were fresh surgery scars.&quot;Sir&quot; The nurse says weakly &quot;Please the patient...&quot;&quot;He&#039;s going through physical therapy right?&quot; You ask, backing away and letting the nurse breath, who blinks and stammers a question of if you are family or a friend that you answer with a dull affirmative &quot;Yes&quot; Jerome croaks, and tries to demonstrate, lifting up his arm, muscles twitching as his face contorts into a grimace of effort. You choke up as, after a bit of struggling, he manages to salute&quot;You&#039;ll be out of here no time!&quot; You nearly cheer, clenching one of your hands into a fist, as the nurse looks away and begins massaging Jerome&#039;s weakened limbs, stimulating the muscles as a nutrient and steroid solution is pumped into them. He can&#039;t talk much, but listens well. And what he&#039;s able to say, is encouraging. Apparently, once he&#039;s back on his feet, he and few of the other early recoveries will be put back through remedial training.Cont"

Let it never be said that Spartans aren&#039;t tenacious.Next, you visit Alice, who is recovering just as quickly as Jerome is. Her legs, which had been twisted and shriveled, are now straightened with braces and surgical pins. She&#039;s wheelchair confined and needs to bandage her eyes as they recover from one of her surgeries and her voice is quieter than Jorge. You just sit by her side and hold her hand, tracing letters on her palm and complimenting how hard she&#039;s fighting to get back on her feet and that she&#039;ll be shocked to see how much all of you have grown once she gets her sight back. You&#039;d have liked to stay by her side for longer, but she needed to be put under for a round of injections and hormone therapy, so you leave a tactile drawing by her bed that she can experience via touch.Then, after a quick break for ice coffee, you check in on Douglas, who is re-learning how to move his body and re-tune his hand eye coordination from his bed, where he is being restrained.&quot;Is this really necessary?&quot; You ask&quot;Sir&quot; He says weakly, struggling to rise and you understand, he&#039;s trying to do too much too fast and is risking his rehabilitation &quot;I&#039;m trying my best to get combat ready again!

You couldn&#039;t imagine how badly that would hurt, but you sat between them, looking them both in their eyes and solemnly told them that they had orders not to die unless it was against the Covenant. Otto, actually, managed to weakly laugh and Marge was able to will her head to move in a half nod. But since they were scheduled for surgery, you didn&#039;t have long to stick around and despite wishing to, weren&#039;t allowed to observe the operation. You stayed in the facility long enough to hear that both of their surgeries had succeeded, and to send a congratulatory card to both of them, to be read to them when they woke up.After those two, you checked in on Victor, who was having his jaw rewired and a few of his bones switched out for flash cloned replicas. His head was shaved bald and you could see the cuts where they&#039;d popped open his skull to perform brain surgery. He isn&#039;t too happy to see you, not that you can blame him since you and Otto did beat the ever loving shit out of him for snitching and he never really forgave you for that. But he calms down as you, calmly, explain that it is in the past and there are more important issues than one&#039;s definition of &quot;Anti Spartan Behavior&quot;. Yours just happened to place being a treacherous backstabbing snake above fraternizing. He isn&#039;t able to move his mouth without swallowing his own tongue yet, but can communicate with mechanical keyboard. He really lays into you, and you bear the brunt of his aggression. And while you aren&#039;t a therapist, you are able to bury the hatchet and move on from the past. Seems he just needed to vent, and after awhile, he and you are talking on better terms and before you leave, Victor promises to prove he&#039;s still Spartan material, despite his past behavior. Not sure you buy it, but you hope he&#039;s matured since then.Fhajad is next on your list. &quot;I don&#039;t think they&#039;ve found a cure for Parkisons as severe as mine yet, though they have run some experimental tests&quot; He says, seated, hands trembling in his lap &quot;Glad you&#039;re still holding out hope that they&#039;ll...fix me, but I...I can still help from here.

It might not work, but there&#039;s a chance that it might. Hold out for it. For me.

Victor might&#039;ve need a few bones replaced, but to reverse the bone ossification gone array that twisted the two of them and disfigured them beyond recognition, to allow them to live anything approaching a normal life, let alone returning to active duty, they&#039;ll have to go through several experimental procedures. Their eyes, especially Rene&#039;s, light up as you walk closer to their tanks and you&#039;d like to think they&#039;re aware enough to recognize who you are. You talk to Rene through the glass wall between you, that Halsey is planning on flash cloning and replacing most of her skeleton, and that she&#039;ll have to go through have muscles surgically fastened and secured around a brand new frame and have her nervous system rewoven from the ground up. You don&#039;t think she could hear you, but if she could, you don&#039;t think she&#039;s aware enough to understand you. But the ONI doctors attending them are hopeful, and tell you that their early tests have already returned a few positive results. And that they think they&#039;ll soon be healthy enough to communicate through sign language. But it could take years to get them back to even looking human. But you hold out hope, that they&#039;ll be fit and able and back on the field in no time. You have to. Put on a brave face and tell them they&#039;ll be okay, if you don&#039;t you may just lose composure and fall apart, sobbing in front of their prisons of glass and saline solution.Yasmine, is buried under IVs, her face covered by a more intensive oxygen system that is half artificial lung. She&#039;s been....dreaming since she washed out. But, after a few surgeries, she&#039;s started showing more brain activity and awareness and even gurgles and opens her eyes a little when you call out her spartan designation or the nickname you called her.&quot;Wake up Little Bee&quot; You whisper, brushing aside the hair covering her ears &quot;It isn&#039;t the same without you&quot;.Her heart rate grows irregular and lets out a few hoarse gasps, her eyes opening a little bit more and you think you make out a &quot;Sir yes Sir&quot; but that could&#039;ve been your imagination.

        "text": "You keep yourself in check and maintain discipline and keep your integrity, but the first thought, the initial knee jerk reaction as the idea that ONI took Serin and is keeping her isolated or as a guinea pig takes root; is that you could just loosen Vali&#039;s leash a little. But, you never seriously consider doing that. It is an idea born of a flash in the pan burst of rage. Only an absolute moron or an idiot would use an AI like Vali so recklessly. An absolute moron, or a terrorist that wants to see the world burn a little quicker. But the clarity that follows the anger as it sharpens and cools with your head, does give you at least a thread to tug on. It won&#039;t get results quickly, won&#039;t get you to Serin and won&#039;t get her out of whatever Spook has taken her, but it&#039;ll be a start.And it is a much more elegant solution that letting a wildfire of a Dumb, cyberwarfare AI loose in a few of the Office of Naval Intelligences&#039; secure networks. And it is brilliant, at least in your opinion, in how simple it is. To find Serin, or at least get the ball rolling down hill. All you have to do is bring her up in the last couple of check ins, you won&#039;t even need to say anything incriminating. ONI has been watching your every move and recording everything said between you and the washouts. And knowing how paranoid government agents can be, all you really have to do is say Serin&#039;s name and ask about whatever happened to her, and it&#039;ll cause a domino effect.Because once the operatives monitoring report to their superiors, they&#039;ll report to their bosses, and the rest of ONI will take notice. Which means Halsey will notice and start digging herself. If she hasn&#039;t already, which is probably more likely than her missing one of her Spartans vanishing into thin air.

I think he will do greatly in any position we give him. Its just that changing from this hospital to a ship under Sven, is a big change. As regard as Soren goes, his background and how he was described makes him a woodsman. So perhaps he will have in mind to make sure the equipment is rugged and resiliant if he ends up Quartermaster.We are probably going to have ONI and Command, or more likely, someone sent by them coming to talk with us about Soren in our ship.

You almost feel like the service records NAVCOM and ONI had sent you for the officers they&#039;d suggested and put forward to fill the positions of your bridge crew were bait. It&#039;d be expected for a captain, especially a new and unproven one, to be particular of their command staff and immediate subordinates. But you were at heart a soldier and understood that on a ship, any ship but especially a Navy ship, smooth operation and combat effectiveness began at level of the servicemen and women keeping it running as intended. The lower ranks and decks, the enlisted personnel and fresh faced cadets. Most captains wouldn&#039;t devout much time or energy to them, and probably let most of their crew be chosen for them. But you, you weren&#039;t the traditional sort of officer. Which was just fine. Because a ship captain&#039;d by a spartan needed to be anything but ordinary.The Razor Class, uniformly speaking, has a crew of twenty two barring some notable exceptions. And their drop can hold around about forty soldiers and their kit, plus a few extras. Which meant there were a lot of service records you need to shift through. Even though the selection was carefully curated and jointly handpicked by NAVCOM and ONI, that still meant they had cast a large net. Narrowing the small libraries worth of service and personnel records down to a meager twenty two, would take time. But it had to be done. Otherwise ONI would hand out the appointments and decide who served on your ship. Which is why they lead with the service records and profiles of the Razor&#039;s potential bridge crew and pilots.But as you start reading through and processing through the records, you quickly notice a couple of patterns start to emerge, both in their psyche profiles and service records. One, being that most of them are scratching the top percentage in terms of both education and their career stats. Some of them would qualify and in-fact had been training to be ODSTs until they decided on a career change. Another is that they&#039;re either troublemakers and mavericks or have nearly flawless records. The delinquents amongst them have their infractions listed, as well as several demotions. Nothing too extreme, but all of them are the sort of thing you could easily imagine yourself or one of your dragons doing. Punching out a CO to stop a suicidal order from going through and abusing the chain of command seem like just your style. But besides the acts that got them reprimanded and in more than a few cases demoted, they all had exemplary records. Their assignment and deployment histories, while short overall, were impressive.And it soon become clear, as you read through and the patterns confirmed themselves and a new ones emerged, that the selection of crewman they&#039;d handed you could easily be divided into several of groups based on their observed qualities, behavior , overall performance records as well as their previous postings.Cont"

People that could be trusted to be deployed on various covert operations under the direct command of a young officer who was only officially acknowledged to exist because he graduated the academy. Suitable for Spec ops &amp; Black ops deployments and the kind of action Spartans would intended for. They&#039;d clearly been chosen with for both their performance and the secrecy of their assignments. All of them were lower ranked than Lieutenant. Some of them were ONI, Some of them weren&#039;t. Some had issues with authority and had been ranked down because of it. Some were noted for shooting their own squad mates for refusing direct orders of their COs. Some had the psyche profiles of serial killers, others were just a few steps below Spartans when it came to tactical brilliance. Some of their service records were filled with displays of exceptional valor under fire and heroism worthy of a Saga, others would probably be tried for war crimes if even a bit of the black ink was wiped off their profiles.But they&#039;d all been chosen for their competency as Navy men and soldiers and despite ranging from Sociopathic Spooks to Potential War Heroes in the making, you saw that all of them were chosen because Command and ONI both believed they&#039;d play nice with Spartans and, more importantly, not crumble under the pressure of the sorts of assignments your ship would be given. And by separating them into groups based off the patterns you&#039;ve noticed and selecting from those groups who you considered to be the best for the posting, the process of narrowing down the war memorial sized list of names was greatly expedited and made the task of picking only twenty two of them to serve on your Prowler much easier. Which would make the selection process for the ranking officers and pilots quicker and easier as well, since who you had on your crew would inform your choice for its higher ranks and command staff. And more importantly, the choice of crew would reflect on the ship itself.

        "text": "Considering the type of the missions Spartans are sent on, the sort of jobs you can expected to do, and the covert nature of the kinds of operation the ship will take part in and transport your team to, the crew on the ship have to be flexible, adaptable and with a varied range of education and training, with versatile skill sets. They can&#039;t all come from the same source or have the same experiences, and they won&#039;t be the cream of the crop at least to start. But you need them to be able to react to and provide an answer for any obstacle the Prowler will run into and the unexpected and unknown challenges she and her crew will face in the line of duty.So, knowing that your ship will benefit from being crewed by personnel from a wide range of backgrounds and prior appointments, you choose the twenty two servicemen and women who&#039;ll be the first crew of the Prowler, and Norns willing its only crew, selecting them based of how flexible and quick to adapt they&#039;ve been in prior appointments, their individual areas of expertise and professional training, as well as any unique or abnormal skills and talents they&#039;ve displayed priorly. Not just who is the best at running their stations or has the highest marks in their marksmen classes or in the simulations they&#039;ve trained in, but who used to serve as a field medic in the Marines before switching to the Navy, or who had a background in Espionage and had previously worked for Section One before deciding they were better suited for frontline action. You still narrow down the search further by making sure you don&#039;t take too many who share the same or similar skill sets and training, shoring up the weaknesses of some of the crewmen with the strengths of others whose own gaps in their resumes are held up by the expertise of others. Its a careful balancing act. But this sort of out of the box thinking is something you excel at, and gradually you build a list of names and service numbers that you think would be a good fit in the crew and provide the sort of experience and aptitude that&#039;ll help make the whole of the crew more versatile and adaptable than it otherwise would be. At a glance they could seem Ragtag. Patchwork. A gaggle of misfits and professionals from different branches of the military and the office of naval intelligence. A handful are core worlders, some are inner colonists and several are from the outer colonies. With life stories and service records that range from spotless to suspect. Some of them are young. Some of them are old. But they&#039;re all capable in their own unique ways and bring to the table certain skills and talents that aren&#039;t part of regular military or naval training and education; and in some case not at all in line with regulations.But that&#039;s the point. Diversity of background and skill pool, will benefit your ship&#039;s day to day operation and in field performance. Especially once the crew gets comfortable working with eachother.Cont"

Definetly good too what with killing 5 covie fliersAlena- She was top of the academy, 99% from a &quot;military dynasty&quot; family (that means someone from Command wanted this option here ... for what reason ?), likely skilled and elitary. Not yet a leader, completely different war mindset than Sven. Friction. Kit- Knows when to retreat, experienced, probably a fun guy. Likely depressed. Probably was accused of cowardice, might not be that liked by the rest of the crew at first. Then again with the backgrounds of our crew...Bernetta- ONI, experienced, knows how to infiltrate, stealth and boarding. Previous use of prowlers. Lot of REDACTED. The kind of woman that will probably have a smile on her face when she see Sven using something he should have sent with the rest of the loot back home, instead of doing private research to give later.Tor- Civie, good chance of crime (mafias/pirates groups) connection, maverick, possible chance of innies connection, experienced and talented. Possibly both with civilian and military spaceships. Might be from New Norger. Might not. Throwing himself at genocidal aliens take stones and a change of hearth though, so he might not be like his troubled past self anymore (no way in hell this guy was just a civilian pilot). Bari- Veteran, experienced, brave, stubborn. This man has it all, both in bad and good. The kind of guy willing to fight to the last.How they work with us:- Chen, very well. If Sven results are becoming available due to propaganda he will like our maverick attitude and our bravado in war. Mixed on spartan.- Alena, will not like at first the maverick attitude might not work with our orders. Will like our service record, and serving with a very talented super soldier. Likely will be very at odds with other officers and crew, nevermind Purple Team. - Kit, mixed on Maverick. He will like jokes and respect service, probably would like us if he knew about our own actions on Alpha Corvi-II. Unclear on spartans, probably default military answer.- Bernetta, no clue due to ONI. Maybe Gloria knows something- Tor, no idea here. Could be both positive (hero, very talented, maverick) to negative (secret supersoldier child/cyborg)-Bari. Veteran, when he will see the medals and see we are very clearly not some nepo-baby but a talented super soldier he will like us (might be negative on that supersoldier part). Will like our guts and bravery."

        "text": "It takes longer to pick just two out of six than it did to select twenty two out of over a hundred Psyche Profiles and Service Records. And it takes the longest to narrow it down from three to two. Chen Tian, the hotshot fighting ace, young for the number of medals he&#039;s received, was tempting and you almost reconsider as you hold up his profile, looking at the easy going yet cocky smirk on his official file. An attitude he&#039;d more than earned, considering he managed to out fly and shoot down five Covenant fliers in separate dog fights during the evacuation from Alpha Corvi-II and even though you haven&#039;t met the man you feel you&#039;d get along with him just fine. And just scanning and flipping through his verified flight reports, shows he&#039;s a damn fine pilot, especially considering how many maneuvers he&#039;s routinely pulled off that could be generously described as suicidal.You gaze for an extended moment at Warrant Officer Chen&#039;s picture, noting for a third time the non regulation pony tail he&#039;s tied it in and the burn scars rising up to his chin from his throat from his collar bone. And then set it down, reaffirming your choice after contemplating it for a few more seconds. Maybe you could swing getting him aboard to pilot the pelicans, but you are of half a mind if you should make a request. That might be a waste of his talents after all.Then, you pick up the record of the Pilot you&#039;ve decided on Bernetta Coste, who had only recently become military. She was an ONI Operative, a field agent and pilot, but Civilian. What had been the deciding factor was that, while Chen was a better combat pilot, Coste had more experience for the sorts of missions Spartans could be expected to be sent on, experiencing piloting Prowlers and just as importantly, had gotten her hand dirty in the field and knew how to handle herself in a fire fight. She might be ONI, and just a Cadet by rank and have nearly half of her file blotted out with black ink, but you even if you thought you&#039;d get along better with Chen, you couldn&#039;t deny that Bernetta was the better choice to fly the Prowler. She was more familiar with it, and the kind of work the Spartans would be doing. You stared at the picture attached to her file, her exact age was hard to pin down but you as far as you could tell she was in her early twenties, black hair cropped short and with a single mole on her cheek, just beneath one of her relaxed and but somehow piercing green eyes. And while it was hidden by her collar, you could see the edge of a scar. She&#039;d survived getting her throat sliced. She was tough, despite looking like a Civvie.And while you had considered Ostrom as a Co-Pilot, and wanted to hear his story about how he learned to fly as well as he did, not at all buying the official civilian training story he had hawked to his recruiters and had half a mind to see if you could get him on the crew still to pilot the second of the two pelicans, since he might be more familiar with them.Cont"

        "text": "&gt;&gt;6268291 However you just weren&#039;t comfortable trusting a position as important as the Co-Pilot&#039;s seat to a man who had been a criminal and civilian only a few weeks ago. You could trust him to fly a Pelican, but not a Prowler. And he&#039;d be easy to get ahold of than Warrant Officer Chen would be.But his competition in that regard was simply overall a better Choice. Petty Officer First Class, Bari Cook, outranked most of the Spartans and while others might bristle at playing second fiddle to &quot;Just a Cadet&quot;, judging from his last psyche evaluation, Cook wouldn&#039;t. He was experienced, brave, and stubborn enough to remain at his station while the bridge melted around him, having thrown out the previous pilot from their chair when they&#039;d been KIA&#039;d. That kind of courage and iron will were rare. If anyone of them could hang with Spartans in a mission, it&#039;d be Cook. It took balls heavier than tungsten alloy to willingly do what he had done, and what he&#039;d done was save an entire ship and all its hands. The Crew of the UNSC Angry Hornet owed their survival to the bravery of their Bridge Crew, and cook in particular. It had lost him his legs, and he returned to service the moment he&#039;d gotten cybernetic replacements. and that was exactly the sort of tenacity, discipline and energy you wanted on your bridge. You looked down at his picture, Bari cook Wore a stoic and focus expression, his beard shaved close to his chin and his head shaven. He was thirty two years old. He had his service number tattooed along his cheek and his demeanor in the official file, was entirely different than his off duty one that ONI had gotten their hands on of him on vacation in Emerald Cove. And unlike the partner you&#039;d picked out for him, there was a lot more to go off of to get an idea of what his personality was like. Coste was an enigma, Cook certainly wasn&#039;t.&quot;Now for the rest of the bridge crew&quot; You mutter to yourself, standing to do a few stretches and limber up before returning to the paperwork in front of you, cracking your knuckles and loosening your shoulders with a few quick shakes before pacing around the desk, grabbing your data pad as you started to review the applicants Command and ONI had sent you for positions on your Prowler&#039;s bridge. &quot;Lets start with our Sensor Operate&quot; You think outload, flicking your finger across the pad&#039;s screen as you continue pacing around the room. Once you&#039;d finished selecting your crew and officers, you&#039;d have to review the reports from the other Spartan missions and write their After Action Reports. Kurt still hadn&#039;t gotten back to you explaining exactly how his team had gotten their hands on a samurai sword mid op....cont"

        "text": "It has to be Soner Kobal. His file says he was able to recognize a shoddy attempt by Pirates to copy the Stealth ablative coating used on ONI Prowlers and not pass it off as a glitch in the system or faulty scanner. That shows he&#039;s good at his job, considering you had difficulty telling the difference between a &quot;real&quot; ghost signal and the trick the pirates use. But more importantly, he didn&#039;t just let his find die along the chain of command and get ignored. When he got brushed off he all but stormed the bridge to hand the Captain of the UNSC Kingfisher proof that he&#039;d detected a &quot;Cloaked&quot; Ship moving into position to ambush their vessel, risking a Court Martial in the process. He&#039;d be a good fit for the ship because of that conviction, and if he was willing to do that in his previous posting, then you doubt he&#039;ll have any trouble keeping you grounded and stop you from getting overtly bold with your strategies. You take one last look of his service profile, noting that he is a practicing Muslism and he began his career serving on a remote scanning outpost. His eyes are grey blue and he wears a mustache, but otherwise keeps his black hair short and under a cap. It is more difficult to decide who your Communications Officer. The two candidates for the position are both green in their own ways and are both Ensigns. Leta White hasn&#039;t served aboard a ship before, however she has a good work ethic and has practice breaking encrypted messages and solving Ciphers. Kon Kiyomi has been in the service for a shorter period than Ensign White and currently lacks the traits one expects from a good communication Officer and will need to come out of her shell and get a backbone, but she shows potential. Has very few accolades or commendations in her two year Career, but she managed to not only pick up Covenant Com Chatter, which is frankly nothing short of Astounding, but managed to get a warning out quick enough that the Scout Fleet was intercepted before it could report back about the location of the outpost. That is impressive.&quot;If she doesn&#039;t work out&quot; Thinking out-loud, you make your decision &quot;I&#039;ll swap Ensign Kon for Ensign White&quot;But you have a good feeling about your pick, and had hopes that she&#039;d grow into her role but it wasn&#039;t as if having a meek COMs Officer was the worst thing that could happen to a ship. In the end, either she&#039;d fit into the role or she wouldn&#039;t and could be replaced. You frowned, for some reason feeling a little annoyed when you saw how long she wore her dark hair. And the fact she wore glasses. You&#039;d have to check her medical file later, to make sure her vision wouldn&#039;t be an issue either.Picking out the Prowler&#039;s Navigator was just as much as a challenge as selecting its Communications Officer. Brunnhilde Busch having an Anti Social Personality Disorder wasn&#039;t an issue and certainly it wasn&#039;t a dealbreaker. Cont"

        "text": "&gt;&gt;6268912She had the right characteristics for a navigator, patient and observant and she seemed like a natural fit for stealth operations. But how would she react when she came under fire? Unlike the Ensign, Lieutenant Junior Grade Marissa Deluna had some combat experience and a talent for minute adjustments to headings. It wasn&#039;t easy moving one ship through an asteroid field, usually that sort of maneuver was left to the ship&#039;s AI, you aren&#039;t surprised that Deluna had gotten a medal for guiding a fleet through one mostly unassisted. The equations she had to run must&#039;ve been incredibly complex, and you knew that a single mistake would&#039;ve lost ships. To pull that off, her equations had to not only be precise but done quickly. And judging from her education records, she&#039;s a savant with mathmatics.If we lose Deluna or she isn&#039;t a good match for our unit, Ensign Busch would be a good replacement, you think as you make a note to keep an eye both on Ensigns White and Busch&#039;s postings, just in case. Deluna kept her chocolate colored hair medium length and tied into a ponytail, and had a sleeve of colorful, floral tattoos. She also apparently had a few younger sisters who had recently enlisted. You flicked her profile and picture away, the last thing you saw of either being her static, chipper smile.Which of the applicants received the spot of the Prowler&#039;s Weapon Controller was obvious. Whether by destiny, happenstance or the meddling of ONI, the other survivor of the UNSC Angry Hornet&#039;s command staff had also ended up in the list. Lieutenant Junior Grade Valerie Faure, who had been on that burning deck right alongside Petty Officer First Class Bari Cook, and had recommended and campaigned for him to be recognized for his heroism, even while abed and recovering from her injuries, which were so severe she needed to have her lungs replaced and had her left arm amputated from the shoulder down, replacing them with a flash cloned set of lungs and a robotic arm.Your temper had run hot once, when you were a younger kid, and from what you&#039;ve read on her service records and psyche profile, she has it under control. And someone who can provide a firing solution while surrounded by fire, is someone you want on your ship. You pause for a moment before sending the names of the officers you&#039;d picked to Command, eyes flicking across the picture attached the Junior Lieutenants profile. Blonde hair, cut short, longer on one side. Which was interestingly not the side of her face not covered in burn scars. It was an interesting contrast, the scarred flesh surround her sky blue eye. You hand searched for and found a penicilBut there wasn&#039;t time to start drawing, not yet. There were still reports you needed to read, and you needed to put in the transfer request for Soren. You&#039;d send that in with the rest of the crew selection and find which position and where he&#039;d be comfortable on the prowler once it was flying and in service. Cont"

Perhaps an engineer who likes the idea of being able to take apart Covenant toys and tell us how to use them. An intelligence type who likes looking at what we&#039;re doing, figuring out how to best fuck up the Covenant, and telling high command what we&#039;re doing right. Perhaps a second AI (assuming ship might already have one) with a hate on for the Covenant, and who would like to have our little brother dumb AI as a henchman for cyber attacks. A drone specialist who would be able to help run recon drones and boost our reconnaissance capabilities before attacks. And finally...&gt;A really really likeable liaison officer whose sole job is to explain and justify in a plausibly deniable fashion who the Spartans are, and what exactly we need of other UNSC forces that we might have to work alongside.

But just in case that the request ended up in the hands of a bean counter who didn&#039;t understand just how difficult giving a Spartan-II proper medical treatment actually would be to someone who wasn&#039;t familiar with the augments they&#039;d received, you detailed exactly why their expertise would be needed in an extended operation.And while your artistic skills were mostly confined to the visual medium, you included a few vivid descriptions of the difficulties that&#039;d be experienced in someone who didn&#039;t know of the different ways Aster had made your soldiers more than human, would encounter tending to their wounds and for the benefit of those arm chair generals who only cared about results, cooked up some percentages to show how drastically improperly treated injuries or damages to augmented parts of a Spartan would reduce their combat effectiveness. It all reads in very detached and clinical voice, but that was just you writing it in a language that the intended audience would understand.You also made certain to provide a few names and note that, presently, the Spartan-II project didn&#039;t have much of a need for all of its hands to be on deck and a few of its doctors could be spared as the second class was, at best, a distant dream treading water on the horizon.

You also note, to make the request more reasonable, that the two personnel could serve as backup pilots for the Prowler itself, in case the original two are injured or killed in the line of duty. You expect that they&#039;ll refuse at least a few of the requisitions you&#039;ve made, especially since several of them are for top secret prototypes, but you&#039;ve got a good feeling that the request will be mostly approved.You read both the request forms over from top to bottom one last time, checking for spelling and grammar errors, typos and misidentified serial numbers or any mistake on your part that could get them denied. And after making certain they&#039;re both up to standard, you forward them to Vice Admiral Stanforth, as professionally as possible.

Spartan-029 piloted the craft to the pirates base amongst the asteroid field, avoiding patrols and detection along the way.Blue team, lead by John, perform an in flight drop and EVA, infiltrating through a waste disposal pipe and successfully reach the inside of the pirate station, traveling through approximately sixteen hundred meters of atmosphere-less piping. Red team, mean while, created a diversion and made a landing in the cargo bay of the pirate station, using the pelican&#039;s weaponry to destroy the docked ships and clear the site for landing before departing and engaging with enemy reinforcements in what would be a prolonged fire fight in terms of engagements between Spartans and Ordinary Humans. Blue team infiltrates undetected further into the station, terminating a total of four patrols and security teams before reaching the mission objective, most of the battle hardened pirates being otherwise occupied with Red Team, who at the time of Blue&#039;s arrival, request the deployment of &quot;The ONI Bots&quot;.

Two Spartan Teams are covertly landed on the rural colony of Ambition, alongside several conventional Military vessels and deployments.

Green and White team rendezvous outside of Ambitions metropolitan center, and select different sectors of the country side to search for any signs of the invisible assassins, having gathered and reviewed the footage and evidence prior to the drop.

They acquiesced and arranged for themselves to act as bait to draw out the suspected Covenant infiltrators. White team was positioned outside amongst the farmlands, while Green team kept watch over the route designated by their Navy Contact for their arrival to the planet.While Green team was one security duty, Spartan-017 ordered her team to spread out and search the farms and rural parts of the colony for any signs of Covenant activity, breaking White team into two squads of two. -141 and -044, acting as her spotter, detected suspicious activity on their motion trackers and informed -052 and-077, who moved to get the officer who elected to act as bait out of harms way.They were engaged by numerous cloaked assailants, who descended upon them as they escorted the VIP back towards the shuttle.

The fact that the Covenant have yet to confirm Spartans is also very nice.The War Effort is going well. - BAD MEDICINE results should help project BERSERK research. The nose around the Einherjar neck is closing, which is great. The sooner the innies movements don&#039;t have access to zealot shock troopers ready to die and drug themselves for war the better. They could start raising them from their own locals, but i don&#039;t think they will have the time.- BLACK BEARD is something we didn&#039;t see with those exo-skeletons of project RHODES. I am not sure if they will be available anytime soon (they must be in the same boat of project TYPHON!). If nothing else though, it could be an option for washouts. We have learned of a fleet of covenant too, which is pretty nice and eliminated a pirate group which is even better.- SVARTALFAR is more dead lizards, and even one captured. Loot and corpses, not bad. Keeping Ambition for a little longer is probably the best benefit. And a katana ? hahaha i guess someone will make a request for new melee weapons in the armory !&gt;&gt;6269623&gt;The fire team infiltrated immediately and terminated the on site security with exceptional precision and swiftness. Outer facility guard patrols were wiped out in approximately twenty secondsExcellent work Grey Team&gt;deceived the rest of the faculty that the Spartans were an Insurrectionist cell. This deception resulted in the eventual, complete depletion of the facility&#039;s on site staff.what a fool. This couldn&#039;t have gone any way better, beside capturing more innies.&gt;&gt;6269650&gt;&gt;6269660&gt;Spartan Dreadnaughts. I wonder. I was thinking a lot about Soren and the washouts with cybernetics. Even included in the prior vote a cybernetics specialist. Because i am not sure the current medical efforts ONI will have them ever see a battlefield. And thats just a damn shame, even spartans washouts are great soldiers.I feel that project RHODES could cook up something to put Soren in a modified spartan mech. But i doubt they are thinking about that for now, maybe if they work more closely with Halsey ? Could be an idea. Spartan mech or Spartan cyborg path for Soren and the washouts. Both have their use, though a mech can be pretty large it can&#039;t deploy it everywhere. Still having Soren being there with us while trashing around Hunters and Brutes would be cool, and he would have plenty of firepower. Both options requires cybernetics i feel, a lot. It might be up in the clouds for UNSC as far as priorities go for research.&gt;&gt;6269812Have a nice day 404 !What you think of the explosive mix of crew and officers in our Prowler ? Fun ? Are the White Whale and Mr Cyzo &#039;Vodomee going to be put in the same prison ship and sent to the UNSC version of Alcatraz ?

From the current point in the quest&#039;s timeline, that&#039;s a little less than three months away if I&#039;ve done my maths correctly. Of course, The UNSC has gotten an early &quot;Win&quot; by the capture of the Unrelenting, and the Covenant Offensive against Alpha Corvi-II was more aggressive/ heavier compared to their campaign in canon, and a few other factors/ hiccups going on in the background, could make the reveal happen sooner than it did in Canon, but it wouldn&#039;t really matter in the grand scheme of things since, again, to the best of my understanding, its like 3 months from War Reports&#039; &quot;Now&quot; when the public learns about the Covenant. However, considering the battle of bliss and the subsequent glassing of Bliss is set to happen in two months down the timeline, and the recovered data logs being published is what convinces the Outer colonies/ Innies that the ONI wasn&#039;t just pulling shit out of their ass and inventing an alien threat. But I assume that the Contents of the Accra&#039;s black box being publicized are part and parcel of ONI going public with the Covenant Threat, so I still think that the &quot;Canon&quot; point of letting the cat out of the bag is about three months away from the quest&#039;s &quot;present&quot;Do expect the media to applaud Captain Wallace and The brave crew of the UNSC Commonwealth for their victory over and capture of a Covenant vessel (Since the existence of the Spartans are 100% still extremely classified )Hell, they might even make a propaganda movie about it"

        "text": "The maiden flight of a warship is a cause for celebration. It might not be regulation, but a ship&#039;s initial departure from the shipyard it was built in, its first test flight, should be accompanied by a ceremony. That its maiden flight coincides and overlaps with the precious few days that are left before the Spartans are deployed and scattered across the front and separated, truly separated and spread out across the stars and colonies to at last fulfill their purpose in confronting an existential threat to all of mankind, is a happy coincidence. One that even at your most cunning you couldn&#039;t have planned or arranged better.It&#039;ll be the last time you&#039;ll be together as one unit, one outfit, one squad, one team, one class. One family. It&#039;ll be the last time you&#039;ll see some of them you know, and the same will be true for them. Its a big goodbye that&#039;s been looming over ever since graduation day, since your introduction to the Mjolnir system, since the war began in earnest. You suppose you&#039;re all just lucky that there have been no Spartan casualties yet but...well its only a matter of time isn&#039;t it. It&#039;ll be a celebration of the UNSC Skidbladnir&#039;s maiden voyage, its first flight out of dock, but it&#039;ll also be a celebration of the brotherhood of the Spartans, the only time it can be celebrated before all of you are sent to different fronts, commands and objectives. And while you might be lucky and, as the only officer of rank among the Spartans, be able to better keep in touch and oversee at least some of their missions and deployments, for many this is the last time they&#039;ll see each other until they meet again in Odin&#039;s hall. In Valhalla. And that&#039;ll likely be true for you, as well. As tragic as it&#039;ll be, that&#039;s just the nature of war. Soldiers serve and soldiers die. Its only a matter of when and how a Spartan will fall, rather than if.As an brother and officer, it feels like your responsibility to give them this last chance to say goodbye and look each other in the eye before all march off to a war and different battlefields. You owe them that much at least, and can do that much. And it&#039;ll be good for Soren, to see that the lies he&#039;d been fed were just that. Lies and poison. It&#039;ll be good for everyone, really. It is one hell of a commodity during war and on the battlefield to be able to actually say all the goodbyes you wish you could. One last good memory of all of you together for one last time. Solid. Strong.Beautiful. Couldn&#039;t have planned it better if you&#039;d tried, and that&#039;s saying something. If only all one hundred could&#039;ve been here but...well, the dead will be there in spirit and you&#039;ll do what you can to make the washouts feel included as well. You have to, otherwise you&#039;d be betraying them and yourself.Cont"

        "text": "The ground work is a little trickily done. It wouldn&#039;t be a proper celebration without gifts. The first set are minor customizations done to all forty six battle ready Spartans&#039; suits of Mark IV Mjolnir Power Armor, which despite how simple and small of gesture it is, isn&#039;t easily accomplished. Halsey wants the suits to be nigh identical, standardized except for the service number on the largest plate of frontal armor. While that will change once variants and forks of the system enter production and are greenlit for deployment, she has, you find out, a pretty tight strangle hold on the color of the plates and armor pieces and has complete oversight on the technicians in charge of maintaining and equipping the Mjolnir armor. However, while she has made regulations, and they&#039;re as tight as a civilian could write a military code, it isn&#039;t a complete coverage.The answer is insignia, small designs and symbols, that take up less than 5% of the suits total armor area, the same size as the service number printed on the chest piece. Once you&#039;ve noticed that, it becomes easy to forward some small work orders to the techies in charge of maintained, and looking at the speed of which they&#039;re returned complete, the cosmetic adjustments take no time at all. It only takes as long as it takes you to design and sketch the insignia for each Spartans suit. And in short order, every Spartan gets a personal identifier and a touch of personalization to their suits. A gift they won&#039;t notice until they&#039;re suiting up. Of course, you had to hide the requests in routine system diagnostic checks and in a steady pace so Halsey wouldn&#039;t immediately notice what you were up to.You were certain that she would notice, sooner rather than later. And you were also certain her mandates for keeping the armor the same color and undecorated would only last for as long as the Spartans were on reach. You&#039;d seen Nesta practicing carving surface with a similar hardness to the visors, practicing to draw a grinning, fanged mouth along it and you knew she wasn&#039;t the only one with dreams of decorating their gear. Hopefully Catherine wouldn&#039;t be too mad about you sneakily messing with her Armor, but if she asks, you&#039;re sure she&#039;ll at least appreciate if not approve of the reasons you&#039;ve done it.The second step, is sneaking forty seven Spartans down to reach and into your old home base at the compound at the reach naval academy. This is easier than doodling on the power armor was. It is military property and so long as you announce your presence there and let the higher ups know you&#039;re all getting some fresh air, no one will look twice at your break in to the currently empty compound.And, while the others are reminiscing and exploring their old haunts, sparring or practicing their aim, or losing to Jorge in a game of cards, you and Soren go on a little supply run.Cont"

There&#039;s no goodies left around the compound, but nearby Camp Hathcock is always a prime target for a bit of covert looting and scrounging. Soren drives you there and watches the Warthog that luckily had the keys left in the ignition, and you sneak inside. And mark down the &quot;supplies&quot; you take as being confiscated or taken for disposal, all according to protocol of course. And while Sweet William Cigars are sought after, they keep enough boxes of them in Hathcock for its usual occupants that one or two won&#039;t be missed, and the few pallets of sweets, snacks, junk food, soda and juice boxes will be written off as ordinary losses. You know the Marines stationed there fudge the numbers to add a candy bar or half a dozen to their rations while stationed there.And as quickly as you came, you slip out and toss Soren a bar of chocolate while you twist the top off a glass bottle of soda and sip it as he sends the warthog back towards the compound, the two of you reminiscing about training and the other times you&#039;d broken into Hathcock. And learn that Soren mistook a bottle of expensive whiskey for soda once and nearly threw up and alerted the guards when he took a swig of it. Once you get near the perimeter of Home base, you ask Soren to stop, and clamber onto the hood of the Warthog and stand atop it, a box of cigars under one arm, your third bottle of soda in hand, a lit cigar clamped between your teeth and as many bags of junk food and candy as you can fit under your other arm. And return to your home of eight years glorious, like a modern day alexander or napolean, as your brothers and sisters welcome you back with cheers as they see just how much booty you&#039;d gotten after slipping out. The cheers falter for a few moments, as they recognize soren behind you, in the drivers seat, and then they return, louder and more thunderous as all fifty five of them are overjoyed to see one of the comrades they thought they&#039;d left behind for good make an appearance. You don&#039;t need to look back to know that you&#039;ve just made Soren&#039;s weak with this stunt, which you&#039;d pulled off without a hitch&quot;Look who I&#039;ve found to join my crew!&quot; You declare loudly, hopping off the slowing warthog, and tossing Ralph a packet of spicy chips as you step around the side of the vehicle and helpr Soren out &quot;They had him doing filing paper work and pushing pencils, work that any of us could do in our sleep, seemed like a waste of his talents and smarts, so I pulled him out of there. Got anything to say Soren&quot;Cont"

Someone has started a bonfire already away from the turf and any flammable buildings. But before you join the pow wow around the fire and start roasting marsh mellows, you signal John that you want to have a private chat with him, a gesture that you know wasn&#039;t missed by any of the other Spartans even if it&#039;d have been entirely missed anyone who hadn&#039;t gone through the program.He nods and walks with you into the dark, and you lead him away until you&#039;re standing at the bottom of the steps. You lower yourself and sit down, while John remains standing at attention until you nod to your side and he takes a seat right next to you. Folding your hands together, you let out a sigh, and take the cigar from your mouth and grind it out on the concrete slab, already at your limit of enjoying it and no longer needing it to look striking.&quot;What do you want to talk about, Sir?&quot; John asks as you flick the partially smoked cigar away and see how far you can send it.&quot;I spoke with every Spartan who washed out, not just Soren.

That you&#039;d always have his respect&quot; You start, and John keeps his eyes fixed on the ground and you can&#039;t get a read on what&#039;s going on in his head or his heart &quot;But that, despite my urging, he wasn&#039;t going to consent to any rehabilitation efforts. Aster took too much of a toll on him, and not just on his body. He wanted me to apologize to you on his behalf&quot;&quot;What&#039;s there to apologize for?&quot; John asked, sounding as hurt as he was confused &quot;It wasn&#039;t his fault, and I don&#039;t blame him for not risking his life with experimental procedures.

It meant a lot to me&quot; He says professionally &quot;and knowing he thinks of our time together fondly, its helped&quot;&quot;Helped?&quot; You call out, but John is already marching away. But you think you know what he means by that. Smiling, you stand and walk back to the party to Mingle.You wrestle with Carris, Sam, and Jorge. Play bloody knuckles with Ralph, Daisy and Kai. Talk tech with Dimas, Michael and Naomi. Scratch build some Fireworks with Grace, James and Robert. Take the Warthog for a spin with Leon, Joshua and Solomon. Argue about the best historical general with Kurt, Fred and Illya. Toss empty bottles for Cal, Linda, August to try and &quot;snipe&quot; with rocks, after egging them onto see which of the three girls were the better shot. Lose a game of Five Finger Filet to Nesta, Jai and Vinh, that ended when Nesta narrowly beat Jai. Get scolded by Shika after she&#039;s sees what you&#039;d done to your hand. Convince Oscar you&#039;d injured your hand because of a dart throwing accident after he&#039;d asked you if you&#039;d seen Shika. Judge a footrace between Li, Kelly and Malcom, even though when the rabbit is on the field its obvious who&#039;d the winner would be. Then you and Nicole use each other as practice for some new moves you were both working on. Win a few extra bars of chocolate with Adriana after tricking Edgar and Anton into trying to figure out a way to keep either of you restrained with what was on hand. Sketch Arthur as the king he shares a name with. Roast marshmallows with Soren, Isaac and Kai. Tell what little you remember about growing up on New Noregr to Joseph, John and Vannak. Play the part of the Svartalfar as you demonstrate for Keiichi, Maria and Riz how they fight with their energy swords. Tell Nadja that she&#039;s inspired her friends amongst the washouts, and play cards with Sheila and William, and tell them about how you drove a tank into the sea. And you do all these things, long enough to have a heart to heart chat with each and everyone of them and make sure they&#039;ve done the same and had a chance to all say their good byes and leave nothing left unsaid between themselves. And as the bonfire starts to die down, and the supply of sweet treats and bubbly drinks starts to run dry, you gather up your dragons and using a swathe of wall that is out of sight of the security cameras and patrol routes and use it as the surface of a runestone.With knives, chisels and paint, Jorge, James, Nesta, Shika, and Daisy help you immortalize the triumphs of Purple team throughout boot camp as all six of you reminisce about bootcamp while you commerate the first class of spartans along the wall. You and Shika do the best work painting in the colors, while Nesta is the best of carving and James gets the lines in the wall neat and precise, while Jorge works on cutting the deeper outlines.Cont"

It has weight to it. A coldness. A distance. It isn&#039;t Shika&#039;s silence. Something is clearly different to her usual, purposeful mute.It takes a few minutes for you track her down again after she gave you the slip while you were checking the notification that you&#039;d been forwarded, informing you that your special requests for the Skidbladnir. You find her, in one of her old haunts, a place that none of the trainers knew about, a cubby she found for herself in the cracks of the compound. She isn&#039;t inside it, she outgrew it years ago, but she&#039;s sitting outside of vent she used to sneak into to get away from it all. Her eyes flick up to you, and that is the only acknowledgement she gives you as you lumber up to her.

Five years ago. And despite my epithet being a point of pride, I&#039;m not a real ghost. Am I? Sir?&quot;&quot;Hmm&quot; You hum, sitting up straight and trying to unravel the mystery now in front of you as Shika glares at the empty space in front of her, trying to put together the puzzle herself.

Sometimes just trying to put it out of mind is merely a stalling tactic. Logically the most sound explanation is that the flash clone had some measure of longevity. Perhaps her smaller size means an equally less intensive metabolism and further cellular stability to the clone. It&#039;s also possible that her family, or at least someone with that photo moved to Ambition after the fact. Alternatively, Oscar would certainly have seen Shika in various states of dress throughout the program and it IS possible that he did simply see something in a heightened state of stress. Not a hallucination per se but the brain putting details where they shouldn&#039;t be. The brain actually REALLY likes to do that shit for no goddamn reason. He may have seen something else but his memory specifically is filling in with Shika. He could have some kind of stress or head trauma. There are explanations for this.

It was only a few years ago.. She didn&#039;t have hair this long, or look so frail and gaunt. But you knew how to ID someone and never forgot a face. Underneath the thinning, lack of wear, roughness, healed scars and tanning, this was Shika at age nine. And, upsettingly, what was most different about her was the eyes. They were tired and dull, without hope or any sort of spark that the Real Shika had. None of the competitive spirit or confidence.

She&#039;s a neuroscientist who was involved in cloning/AI research with Halsey, helping create Cortana. She was also involved in the relocation of the surviving clone of Dr Halsey (Chloe).Giovanna&#039;s only mentioned by name like 5 times, and there&#039;s no real motivation explained for her part in the relocation of Chloe and &quot;continuing the work of Dr Alban&quot;, who was motivated by hatred of Halsey and his regret over his part in the SII project, so her having a relation to Samson Kaiser (who also hates Halsey) kind of would explain her actions lol...Anyway, I hope if Chloe ends up a thing in this universe she gets a better life. Or at least has a Sven clone big brother protecting her or something. Kek."

The status of some of the Washouts tells me as much, Soren in particular. Believing that there are therapists is wishful thinking, a way of thinking that needs to be abandoned not later, but ASAP and right now. Not only the spartans are on their own, they are on their own and can only get what they need with their own strengths.This said, i would personally prefer to handpick a therapist than rely on a last minute list from ONI, they have already enough agents on board of the UNSC Skidbladnir anyway. I previously pushed for this kind of therapist here (see specifics on the therapist i wanted, with other anons also voting for this therapist) &gt;&gt;6269027, and if we need to get one we should push for such a kind or a similar professional."

And what was waiting for them in the Armory, certainly confirmed that Cook was serving on an ONI vessel. There were a flock of Technicians of some sort, gathered around a figure that looked alien.

It clogged the air surrounding the body of their avatar, rising from no identifiable source. And the purpose for the projected incense was obvious. The AI assigned to your ship chose to appear as a Catholic nun. Presently, as you approached to make her acquaintance, she was knelt, hands clasped around rosary constructed of strings of code and dna sequence in a repeating and switching pattern. She was pretending to or acting as if she was in solemn religious contemplation or prayer, but even though she made her eyes appear as shut, which you could see through the back of her veil and head, you could see she was rapidly reading through the crew log and familiarizing herself with their personal, service and medical records.She was a crisp, spring green color primarily, with a few shocks of orange yellow and rusted brown along her habit and darker, verdant and olive seams of green along her arms and legs. Her hair, tightly bundled and braided in a disciplined and chaste manner, was a lighter, almost white shade of green.She knew the moment you approached the room that contained the projector, having probably calculated your arrival time the second she was integrated into the Skidbladnir. And so, with appropriate gravitas and theater, she introduced herself&quot;Rita of Cascia, the patroness of impossible causes, wounds, the sick and ailing. As well as the patron of victims of abuse, among other things, as is so often the case with catholic saints. She is my name sake, you may call me Rita, Captain&quot; Are the first, stern yet tender words that she speaks to you, with a heavy Italian accent &quot;The woman whom I was patterned from, took comfort in her and other long dead clergymen and women. Her last thoughts, at least the last she shared with me, were wondering if there&#039;d be a light as her life support was cut. She was a doctor. A brilliant one. And amongst her knowledge and fascination with the trappings of faith, I inherited much of her core personality, primarily a selfless need to care for and help others&quot;&quot;So you&#039;re medicinally inclined?&quot; You ask her, as you, to meet her eye to eye and at the same level, kneel next to her though not in a praying way, more like a samurai awaiting their suicide blade&quot;It is my foremost area of expertise&quot; She answers proudly, eyes opening to reveal two brightly glowing spheres of silver cut through with red crosses &quot;And my greatest pleasure. Nothing is more enjoyable to me than preserving a life or repairing damage to a human body. I was told I was assigned to this ship, due to my strong sense of empathy and caring disposition towards those under my charge&quot;&quot;That isn&#039;t the only reasons, you and I both know that Rita&quot; You chuckle and she smiles, and unclasps her handsCont"

You&#039;d arranged it so the flight deck officers would arrive earlier than the personnel you&#039;d hand selected to staff the so new it the hull still sparkled in certain lighting Prowler.Judging from the FoF signatures across your HUD, the first meeting between Purple team and the ship&#039;s officers they&#039;ll be working and serving alongside for the foreseeable future is going smoothly. They&#039;re all clustered together on the flight deck, presumably still watching what James has taken to calling &quot;Jorge and Sven&#039;s greatest hits&quot;, the battle the two of you had against the Covenant Assassin who tried to skewer your white whale. Your hand twitched, as for a brief second, your recollections of the fight pulled you back to it as you considered what a single wrong move or miscalculation would&#039;ve resulted in. That Swordsman was anything but an ordinary threat. Leaving the memory of that brawl in the past, since what lessons and improvements could be learned or made from it, have already been done, you continue to the Troop bay.&quot;Attention!&quot; You project your voice, loud and booming like a distant thunderclap, as you make your entrance. The sudden barked command, triggers the instinct every disciplined solider has. But not all of your crew of Twenty Two salutes, some only give so much regard as to look up from their card games or to stand a bit straighter. But the majority do remember their manners and give you the respect expected to be shown towards an officer.You wait a few seconds, for the many to inform the few, standing tall and proud before them. Its obvious they&#039;re uneasy, and uncertain as to what or who exactly you are. Chalk that up to MJOLNIR.&quot;I am your captain, Lieutenant Sven Askeland. Part of a top secret spec ops unit. For now, all you need to know is that we&#039;re called Spartans and that the missions this Prowler will be sent on, are highly classified. There will be no glory won and no recognition of your service upon this vessel, and as I expect you have to have all already been informed, that maintaining the secrecy of both this ship&#039;s operation and that the existence of the Spartans remains a secret is of the highest priority&quot; You begin to address them and get introductions out of the way quickly &quot;Until your assignment here ends, you are all effectively MIA&quot;Cont"

Who had completely refused to even consider the generous offer the UEG had given for the immediate and complete halting of ongoing hostilities. You understood why a rebel would be suspicious of their enemy suddenly shifting gears and asking for peace, and why they wouldn&#039;t believe the Covenant posed a threat or were even real. Planets would burn. Millions and more would die because of this, in any other circumstances, reasonable caution. But the Einherjar, had gone a step further in ignoring the attempts and even ramping up their terrorist activities and aggression. Maybe they felt the walls closing in after losing their primary supplier of their modern day berserkergang combat stims and having their leader, your own father, dragged off to trial missing an arm and losing one of their primary training sites in the same day.The other factions of the insurrection, at least considered the offer and you hoped that common sense and the aim of mutual survival would convince most of them once the reality of the situation and the war on the doorstep of all of humanity became apparent to them. But, deep down in your bones, you knew the Einherjar wouldn&#039;t. They were fanatics who wanted to die in battle, who had been preparing for Ragnarok. Maybe they were the first of the rebels to believe, and were simply thrashing around to ensure this was the end of days. It didn&#039;t matter if their actions were religiously driven or simply them lashing out and trying to bleed the UNSC as much as they could before they were brought to heel and put down. It simply didn&#039;t matter.They had to be dealt with. The Covenant were the bigger threat, the kind of enemy that Spartans were made to confront and deal with. But the Einherjar were also the enemy, and also needed to be handled before they endanger not only the UNSC war effort but all of mankind. And that is exactly why Operation: IRIMINSUL authorized. A series of precise, surgical strikes to cripple the leadership of the guerilla force. After Operation:BLOODAXE , it became clear that the Einherjar Hierarchy was much more structured and ordered than previously imagined. And Einar Askeland had enough foresight to establish a list of successors, should he be captured or find the violent death he taught his followers to seek out. The infighting was simply them figuring out who would take his position, from an official list of replacements. The Poem that was broadcast after James&#039; team capture the man who ONI called Fenrir, now made sinceThe lunatics thought they were a modern Great Heathen Army. But unlike the Saga of the Ragnarsons, their story would not end with the slayer of their &quot;Father&quot; being given the blood eagle.The Einherjar would be destroyed and if need be, you&#039;d personally escort each and everyone of them to Valhalla&#039;s gates if it meant the end of the threat they posedCont"

        "text": "&gt;&gt;6278050But, Stanforth had also asked for your professional opinion on the rosters and plans of other planned Spartan Ops. And you were happy to oblige. They were still in the planning stages, but would proceed and get underway as soon as the opsec was cleared and the mission directives were finalized. Command wanted another Operation:HADE&#039;S COURTING, and another intact Covenant Warship. You&#039;d at least been making the effort to collect as much enemy equipment and gear when you could, but ONI had learned that having spares was the best policy when it came to poking around Covenant Tech, for its tendency to self destruct when it was tampered with. Rationally, you couldn&#039;t blame them for wanting another ship, it was sensible and the first was already a massive windfall for humanity. But, you also knew how suicidal it was to even try to capture one of the Covenant&#039;s vessels. Capturing Persephone was a combination of Spartan ingenuity, cooperation and sheer dumb luck. The chances of repeating it were close to nil. But, it was a gamble where the payout was worth the risk. So long as they weren&#039;t wagering Spartan lives on a pipe dream. You&#039;d have to include escape plans and make sure the squads sent on the boarding actions knew their survival was a higher priority than capturing a second Covenant Ship.And Vice Admiral Stanforth had made it clear he wanted the planned Operation to be lead by John, and you knew that, tactically, he&#039;d need eleven other Spartans to have the best chance to succeed in capturing another Covenant Warship. Any less than a dozen, and they wouldn&#039;t have enough guns or force application to secure the vessel. Any more than a dozen, the unit size would be bloated and unable to operate at peak effectiveness, and would be wasting Spartans that were needed elsewhere. And it was for those same reasons, the most Spartans you&#039;d have take part of Operation: IRIMINSUL, was also twelve, including yourself. One Squad formed of three fireteams of four. A standard deployment, even though Spartans were the furthest thing from conventional troops. But IRIMINSUL and the risky mission to try and steal another alien ship, weren&#039;t the only missions that were getting ready to launch. A communications array within spitting distance of Alpha Corvi II had gone eerily silent, and was suspected to have fallen victim to the Covenant, and ONI wanted Spartans ready to deploy to a nearby colony to buy time for evacuations and reinforcements.Command also wanted to do a test run to see how effective a military escort made up of Spartans would be, after having gotten the AAR of Operation:SVARTALFAR on their desks and seeing how effectively Green team protected the officer they had used as bait. You thought it was a waste of manpower. But Stanforth thought it could result in one less group of insurrectionists in open and armed revolt. And intelligence knew that same group would try to snap the olive branch they were offering.Cont"

If it lacks the last operations info updates probably.&gt;&gt;6278079&gt;&gt;6278052support this list of this anonthough for DREAM-CATCHER i would heavily suggest to change someone there with Mike, since he is a tech expert and an ace pilot. Having two eggheads, would be great for John. Grey Team in general would be also very ideal to have here since they are stealth specialists (and the mission is Stealth infiltration), and it might be better than Silver Team in that regard. I also think Grey Team has yet to kill some aliens.It goes without saying that Purple Team would be probably the best team to place here due to Sven and Shika experience in capturing a Covenant Ship, but there is more than a few spartans that know of a Covenant Ship in this roster."

        "text": "&gt;&gt;6278052I would also like to suggest to Vice Admiral Stanforth to have a few stealth pelicans filled by squads of ODSTs in a secluded, difficult to see location, in the solar system where the mission of HADE&#039;S COURTING will take place. As for spaceships a few Prowlers would be ideal here.The main issue of FLY SWATTER was the numerical advantage the Covenant had initially in the ship and that only a few Spartans could board in, on top of that the UNSC COMMONWEALTH was the only friendly UNSC ship and was half-dead. It couldn&#039;t provide help until the victory was basically already secured by the Spartans on board. This was dangerous, as there was a window of time were the Covenant could have turned things around after the surprise and shock effect was gone.With this measure instead, when John gives the green light of taking the bridge and the generator of the Covenant Ship, this stealth pelicans can move in and assist by deploying squads of ODSTs (thus negating Covenant numbers advantage and ensuring capture).Of course before the Spartans can even be inside there is two main issues to put in front of Vice Admiral Stanforth and the very eager ONI scientists :- There is a need to be an opening, damage or a compromizing position for the Covenant vessel. Otherwise the Spartans cannot deploy.- All the Spartans in the mission need a newly developed device by ONI that they can deploy in EVA with high amounts of energy in it, that they can send at the Covenant Ship energy shield, for create a brief &quot;opening&quot; in said energy shield for ensure their passage. This should ensure the full team of 11 boards the alien vessel, or at least more Spartans than FLY SWATTER."

        "text": "&gt;&gt;6278192For operation FALLEN - VALKYRIE, i don&#039;t think Sven &amp; Co need any assistance just secure comms with UNSC and CMA allies present (garrison/police) and the UEG diplomats brokering the peace. This is mostly in case the terrorists decided to have a &quot;riot&quot; (by this i mean a few hundred terrorists armed for attack the place of negotiation) ready on Black Sands. I sincerely doubt they will be a problem in that regard and i think we can find them before she tries any nefarious and murderous plan. Eager to wipe the Einherjar out same for terror mom.For operation HOME-ALONE, Fred needs authorized comms with allied UNSC and CMA troops present at the Last Lighthouse colony so they can work together and create an effective defense. I would like to point out to Stanforth and to High Command the effectivness of Violet Team at Black Reef, and how well they worked together with their allies .... even if their allies where Innies rebel militia.For operation TRICK-OR-TREAT, Kurt doesn&#039;t need much beside all info available on the colony and this Innie movement (this &quot;All Hallows Eve&quot;, sounds religious.....). This seems a fairly safe mission but comms with nearby allied UNSC or CMA troops wouldn&#039;t be bad to have. A &quot;call the cavalry button&quot; in case the Innies decide to not play nice and want to try kill spartans."

        "text": "Ingrid Askeland. Your own mother. While you stare down at the picture provided in the file, alongside photographic and audio evidence of her activities as a member of Einherjar, you struggle to match it to the memories remain of her from before your conscription. But the cold eyed face staring back at you very little matches up to the images you conjure. The only similarity is the color and length of her hair. You got your coloring from her, you suppose. For some odd reason, you&#039;re more aware of the shortness of the hair on your scalp looking down at her.You flick the picture away. Operation: FALLEN VALKYRIE has to be the first mission of Operation: IRIMINSUL. Herfjötur was the glue that held the Einherjar together as Fenrir&#039;s chosen successors fought and used their own men as game pieces to take the reigns of leadership that had been left limp with his capture. Removing her from the board would greatly weaken their cohesion and sense of unity, and without her direct support, the terrorist called Jormungandr might find new challenges rising to take his throne. She was the main rabble raiser of the Einherjar and was presently attempting to lure other insurrectionists to join in their futile struggle or join forces with them in their suicidal conflict, taking her out would make sure the Einherjar had fewer friends and that less rebels would use them as Martyrs for the cause.Hardening your heart, you repress the conflicted emotions that rise up as you make your decision and send the transfer requests for the six other Spartans who will be coming Aboard the Skidbladnir to join your dragons in hunting this self styled Valkyrie. You know Naomi can speak Swedish, since she picked up on you teaching Purple team Norwegian back in the day when you all &quot;Traded&quot; your mother tongues, and she&#039;ll be a good second or third in command besides. She&#039;s adaptable and one of the smarter Spartans. And while you feel bad about poaching Green team from under Kurt, they&#039;re the best pick for the job. Solomon, he&#039;s always dependable if still somewhat headstrong, but that is a weakness that won&#039;t come into play when fighting the Einherjar and his strong body will be a good asset. Malcom is always a good pick for a squad and has, like the rest of green team, experience operating in urban environments and hesitation isn&#039;t in his vocabulary. Nor is it in Cal&#039;s, who is in the running for third best sniper amongst the Spartans, you tell her to take a shot, she&#039;ll take it and unless she&#039;s smacked over the head by a hammer, she&#039;ll make it. Anton is one of the best scouts, close to the best but considering Shika and Nesta exist with their unique talents for stealth and anticipating threats, its unlikely he&#039;ll ever be the best. Still a good asset to have on the ground. And Illya, she&#039;s a good hand to hand fighter, not to your, Li and Nicole&#039;s level, but she makes up for it with tenacity and team tactics.Cont"

        "text": "&gt;&gt;6278661Of course John will appreciate having his regular team with him and you know those eagles soar higher when they&#039;re together. Vinh, has experience boarding Covenant Vessels and Isaac and her are close, but that&#039;s not the only reason you&#039;re putting him on the team for...lets call it Operation: Dreamcatch, since you feel like being a smart ass today, Isaac is about as good at Jorge at holding the line. In a cramped environment like a ship, he&#039;ll be able to put those skills to good use. Joshua and Dimas, natural picks, Dimas probably knows more about Covenant tech than any one else after he helped you put together Vali, and Joshua is the best pilot amongst the Spartans. Li is one of your few equals and rivals in hand to hand fight, but more importantly, he moves in low G like a fish in water. Silver team will bulk up the team and you&#039;re choosing them because they&#039;re daring. Especially Kai. She&#039;s one of the bravest people you know.For the mission at last lighthouse, lets call it...Home alone, Fred will be in charge. He&#039;s got great leadership skills and better instincts, Joseph and Oscar would benefit from being reminded what they&#039;re fighting for,Omega team would be a good pick, considering how well they handled Centralia. Asset denial seems to be their forte, after all.And for the Spartans that can be spared for babysitting Duty. You&#039;ll pick them for their social skills. No reason to go in expecting a fight when they might be able to win hearts and minds.Kurt then, is a natural choice for leader and considering his probable rank increase, he&#039;s an even better pick. Grace, she knows how to work with Innies. Nicole has the right personality and demeanor, and her moves in CQC are perfect for protecting a VIP. And Will, well, he&#039;s just got another aware winning personality. And even if they&#039;re all more approachable than the rest of you, they will still terminate any hostiles they encounter.&#039;I should also see about forking Vali and giving the replica over to Dimas for Dream-Catcher, but that could be risky and jeprodize their mission&#039; You think to yourself as you put in the transfer and assignment orders, while also writing a message to be forward to all of the crew of the Skidbladnir, informing them that more Spartans would be arriving to reinforce your team and that the work they&#039;d be doing on the Prowler, while highly classified, would make a difference and matter. &quot;Sven...

It is not the most effective adaptation that survives, but the one that is held by successful breeders. There is no perfect lifeform. Consider the Tigerfolk, Angra, Ogryn, the various Abhumans of the worlds of man. They adapt to become the masters of certain enviroment, to survive in conditions baseline humanity could not thrive. Yet, they struggle elsewhere. Consider the once forsaken now Relieved. They spent so many generations upon a polluted, lifeless wasteland, they have a psyche that struggles to grasp the concept of plenty and comfort. Now, expand this to other sapients. Then further to all animals. Farther yet to all life. and then consider, what would biological perfection look like?&quot;Exhaust 72 left out a cough of black smoke&quot;I...had not considered all available data&quot; They muttered &quot;One cannot define the ideal of biological perfection, for what form it may take depends on the precepts and advantages one is seeking to improve or the negatives traits one is seeking to suppress.

That it had a singular physical form for a brief instant, upon the advent of creation and that its first design was that of the universe itself. Given logic and form.

An event that is now remember through the Festival of Chimes and Cogs, performed once every decade upon the Industrial world to ritually usher in renewal of both the carefully guarded gardens of plantlife as well as the maintenance of every reachable mechanism in the engines vastness&gt;&quot;I was just a boy then. If I had been asked by one of my superiors, what was beauty. I&#039;d have answered a well oiled belt or a tightened lugnut. Oh how blind I was, how ignorant. We all were. I knew something was non standard about that day, when the illumination levels of our factory line housing suddenly lit up. I was near blinded, luckily, I had my safety goggles nearby. My work partner, Wrench 1213, wasn&#039;t so lucky and was flashed and couldn&#039;t see properly for any hour...Ah, where was I&quot; *The aged interviewee, at present time a candidate for the seat of the Engine Near of Labor, paused to gather their thoughts*&quot;Ah yes, the beauties. Jade like is how they&#039;re described, but at the moment when I first laid eyes upon those ephemeral creatures, Imagined them as maidens of pure glass, the crystal stuff that they showed us how to make and put in our laz rifles. The flexible, rubbery kind. They were...it was like they had been ushered in from another plane of reality all together&quot;*The interviewee sighed and reclined in their chair, stroking their beard worn in an archaic Long-Jianese fashion* &quot;Nothing like, not even the Primarch. Oh they were of similar size and stature, but they were different. Hard to explain. Think of it like a model of car, made from a similar frame but for different purposes. I knew at once they were a different kind of human, even from the son of the emperor. Liberty, I remember her the most clearly. She was bold, stomping through our clutter and inspecting our work stations, asking question and challenging to taskmasters with a childish ferocity. She came right up to me, and asked why I had a wrench instead of a hand. I told her I didn&#039;t need five digits more than I needed a good solid clamp. Nearly ripped the aug straight off my elbow and told me I&#039;d be getting a proper cybernetic. Never thought I needed one&quot;*The interviewee flexed their age worn Star metal appendage*&quot;Then came Anahita, asking if I was refused a better prosthetic and when I told her I simply preferred the simple solution, she asked if I was slow and mentioned that a proper replacement hand could grip just as well as a crude wrench. Hadn&#039;t though of that. Only really ever needed one hand. Knew a guy who had two wrenches for hands once. But then again he also had a set of Mechadendrites My biological templates, explain that I&#039;d picked the wrench when I&#039;d lost my hand during a lesson&quot;"

It was like I was standing before divine avatars. They have not aged a day since their progress through our factorum, nor has Lieren. I ponder often, the Terran Emperor&#039;s own absorption of the Engine&#039;s blueprints, and wonder if not Lieren and Kanzeon were spawned from the same document. If the Sisters of artifice were not cousin to the Design process of primarchs. I know that, at the very least, Lord Lieren and Lady Kanzeon&#039;s hearts were tuned to the same frequency....Ah, I just recalled. They visited one of the sweet shops and Little Lady Liberty bought all the kids sweets after Al-Uzza tested them for pollutants. It was the first time I had a sweet besides the celebration of my production date! Ah such sweet memories. They walked so long through the slag and clutter, allowing us to gaze upon their magnificent designs and streamlining our surroundings and lives.

Essentially see for himself what else can be done before shooting starts, if it starts.Last snipped we had seen of him from Malal, had him changing is type of approach post conquest of cities with more rebuilding and less executions. Also he made that cultural society we advised him to make with his sister, and he changed the personal symbol he uses. From the mask to an hammer.At the marriage while looking around the imperial palace he liked our work and our people. I think we inspired him enough, and being on Shangrila for a little while was probably a balsam for him and his sister. Of course our long distance conversations also helped. A new perspective, a relatively short but joyous event and friendly talkings can change someone."

Despite the best efforts of now shamed, disgraced and deposed nobles, who were now beneath even Perturabo&#039;s contempt. He almost found it insulting through the ease of which he had to now enact reforms on nearly every strata of Olympyian society, now that Dammekos had granted him the authority to carry out his will. He doubted his adopted father understood his requests or read through the missives he sent him at length, trusting his oath of loyalty absolutely, but the tyrant did not need to understand. He simply needed to nod and grant his permission. As long as the quiet upheaval benefited him and reinforced his position, Dammekos would agree to grant Perturabo any privileged or command he sought.Not that it was necessary. He&#039;d studied how The Yan dynasty of Shangrala had been replaced with Long-Jia and experienced so smooth a transfer of power. How the high riders were replaced with the free rule that Angron&#039;s presence alone permitted to exist in a state beyond base anarchy. And that was to replace those he removed from positions of authority and power with men and women he deemed at least competent at the tasks asked of them, who owed him more loyalty than they did any other. Some he had saved from the dark depths of prisons, others from the pyres of superstitious farmers, but most he had simply given a chance to express their natural genius and talents, and with a little polish had more than proven their worth.With all the sweeping changes. The pot of Olympia was stirred, and those who sought to bring about his downfall or demise found new allies against Perturabo&#039;s ever increasing tide of societal changes and civic improvements. Some had even dared to rise in rebellion against him, or rather, Dammekos and his line. Only to be crushed and removed from the board all together. The &quot;Payment&quot; He had received from his reprieve upon Shangrala, had made certain of that. And, with Dammekos listening more and more to his council, their replacements were much more capable and far less self interested and narrow sighted.And it worked. it was working. There&#039;d been conflict to start, but many of the once independent cities and states had sworn fealty after a few examples had been made and his &quot;Hammer Force&quot; had shown exactly how effective an army comprised of the most elite and professional of soldiers, armed with weapons far more deadly than any other army upon olympia could field. And yet, he wasn&#039;t spoken of like a monster or thug brute. In fact, amongst the common masses, he had gained something of reputation for mercy and fair handedness.Cont"

The blame for the conquests he headed, fell solely at Dammekos feet, and his epithet of the Hammer of Olympia had changed meaning. And he had gained a number of other titles, given to him without mockery. Of the winter harvest was one of his personal favorites, that he had received when he humiliated a lord of one of the more fertile regions, by bringing to his starving masses food shipments he had harvest mid winter and during a drought.That lord&#039;s heir was now wedded to the wood witch who had made those out of season harvest possible, a blatant attempt at stealing her talent, however she now ruled in both lord and heirs stead, following some advice Calliaphone had given her from the books she&#039;d been given by Lieren. A rare smile twitched onto Perturabo&#039;s face as he reflected on the recent events, the world seeming oddly brighter as he looked over the shining, electrically lighted streets of the first city named in his honor and he was at last noticed for the visionary he was, rather than the blunt instrument he had been forced to be.Blow by Blow, hammer strike by hammer strike, and with a velvet touch to compliment the iron strike, Olympia was being remade and bettered, and his efforts were recognized. Dammekos freely praised him and didn&#039;t try to be accredited to HIS triumphs, the people he&#039;d conquered or subjugated through more delicate methods saw him at worst as a general forced to obey a red handed master, and the common masses only knew Perturabo by the good he did for them and the beauty and efficiency he brought to their lives.It was almost felt like an insult how easily it all had been done.&quot;Reflecting, my lord?&quot; Procopius, his right hand and most trusted subordinate, and perhaps something akin to a friend, asked as he found him gazing out across the streets of the city with a strangely contented smile on his lips&quot;Admiring&quot; He corrected, motioning for the man to come closer &quot;When we first came to this city, we brought its walls to rubble, and now, look at the fruits of our labors.

The renovations are considered masterpieces in their own right. If you have time, I can repeat all the praise they have received since you left&quot;&quot;Forgive me, Lieren, but I can&#039;t hear all of them. I&#039;ll need to be at my sisters side later today, later, when she stuns those who overlook her as just a girl, with the ingenuity of a reform solely of her own design&quot; He explains, before he raised a singular finger &quot;But I shall indulge in a few, so I may take into account any criticism that...&quot;&quot;There are none&quot; You tell him plainly &quot;Even our greatest builders and artists could not find fault in your designs. Perfection isn&#039;t achievable, but the masters of Shangrala do not think they can reach the heights you have. One, who had worked on the previous palace&#039;s construction, in particular demanded I tell you that he was inspired by your use of dyed and carved construction concrete and that it, as you had once said, had been made equal to cut and polished jade. And several have asked if they could return to work under you, when the Gold Dragon&#039;s River is built&quot;He stares, eyes widened in quiet surprise.&quot;What of the military?&quot; He asked&quot;The generals would kiss the soles of your shoes, in thanks of the functionality of the defensive measures you ensured would be in place&quot; You tell him honestly &quot;And Jinhai himself, would present a fine silk robe to you as thanks&quot;&quot;This reminds me...Dammekos has asked me to rebuild the palace of his ancestors&quot; Perturabo, eyes almost gleaming from sheer joy and satisfaction, begins to tell you &quot;I think it&#039;d be fitting for it to be a collaborative effort between the two of us. Consider it my thanks, not only as a brother, but a fellow patron of the arts. &quot;And thus, in a rare instance, you had been caught by surprise!Cont"

Giving them access to a power intrinsically opposed to Chaos could potentially give them ways to survive against Slaanesh, and an entire race historically opposed to Chaos would now have a powerful weapon with which to fight it.Eldrad would basically be in debt to us forever, which we should be certain to hold over his head whenever it&#039;s sufficiently funny."

What sort of beast a Clay Ox was, remained a mystery to the man who had sought to become a spirit speaker in the life now gone. He and his master had been approached by a pair of elders, wearing masks of smooth, lustrous stone, who spoke of dangers lurking the fog of mind and the mist of the spirit and offered to teach them both their ways of wandering through the fog.Star Seeker had not realized how literal they were being, and had seen the world of the Long Jianese and all the magics they knew. But, then, one night during his training. He was approached by his master, and told of deeper secrets and that they were to be trained by two packs of sorcerers. His master was gone now. He&#039;d failed. Star Seeker had put down what had taken hold of his flesh with his own two hands. Oddly, he felt at peace with himself and did not blame those without names who urged them to battle against the haunts they&#039;d captured. Indeed, he felt stronger, more of a man grown now.And so he&#039;d trained, now wearing the ancestral relics of his master as his own, refining the &quot;Psykerist&quot; powers and cultivating inner strength by day, and being honed into a weapon against the night devils by the light of the night pearl above the world of fog. Until, he was fetched again, and told he was meeting the Giant. He&#039;d heard, since he learned enough to talk briefly with the Long Jianese, of the Giant before. A living figure of myth. A great hero. A trickster. and an overwhelming power. The enemy of tyrants and devils, who had sired hundreds of warrior sons upon a goddess of the woods. A man who could make friends with plants and whom could see into the hearts of all men. Star Seeker was nervous, as he and others he had known had past the slaying trial where others had failed to earn the right to cast aside their name for the duty of slaying mischievous sprites, waited to meet the giant.&quot;I heard&quot; The man of metal hummed, eyes glassy as they&#039;d cast aside their hallowed flesh &quot;That Lieren of Nothing lead an assault upon a city that was undergoing a full daemonic manifestation with all of the schools and successfully banished the cults of several of the discordant motive forces, that oppose the Ever Running Engine&quot;&quot;I heard that giantess he&#039;s attached to the hip with, he&#039;d pulled out from the gullet of one of them nasty critters&quot; A sprout of a girl with tangled hair the color of summer grass chirped like a bird &quot;And the both of them gutted the shadowy spook together&quot;&quot;Lieren killed the sorcerer Kamal Kanan, who slaughtered his own people for power&quot; The tall, war paint wearing &quot;Vishnu&quot; laughed &quot;My chieftess says he&#039;d torn them apart, with his bare hands&quot;Cont"

The others gathered to be taught by the Giant, seemed to accept his story, as more tales were shared of the great man.Star Seeker sensed his approach before any others. It was like standing before a great, raging fire, the waves of sweltering heat crashing against him as he stood mere feet away from the boundary of a world swallowing inferno. Like a sea of fire that burned so hot it began to glow like molten metal. The Giant, stood in the center of the Valley of Flame, consumed himself by the torrents of fuel-less fire. The ground split, and the winds of winter blew, silver water spilling out and shining like moonlight and turning to white steam where it met the ever expanding conflagration of a great man&#039;s soul. He was, spiritually, more of a giant than he was bodily. Star Seeker felt he had stood before a once distance star and now scorched his hands reaching towards it. Then there were the eyes. First, silver, cold like a winter morning sky. Heralds of inescapable death. Then, playful and gold like the summer sun, alighting the bounty of spring come to fruit. Long strands of ash grey hair floated behind them as they sauntered forward like the kings of the mountains. The fog world had their own kings, they called them panther. And Star Seeker wondered if Lieren had been sired upon one of these Fog Panthers by his father who sought to claim all stars. His smile was a predators grin as much as it was tale weavers relaxed smirk. This was a man, a warrior, a spirit speaker of two aspects. Perhaps more. Behind him, a shadow stretched towards the horizon, showing the different roles the Giant Whom Seeks Nothing, plays in his life.Then, there was a feeling. Like he&#039;d been peeled open and prepared for butchering. Star Seeker met the giant&#039;s eyes, and felt as if he was having his fortunes read by his own, still bloody bones. The giant stopped mid stride, and studied him like a Bramble Thief does its prey. He was weighing his heart, checking him for sins and wrong doings. He could feel that in his hand, he held a spear that was trained on his chest, should he be found unworthy.He was not alone. Spirits, great and small, of Ice and of the dead, watched Star Seeker closely, as intimately as a mother judges their newborn when times are lean. Star Seeker lifted up his chestCont"

And the giant asked all of there names, one by one, having something to praise of each of them.They were traveling to another world, he told them, to meet with a man who saw far beyond the horizon and into the day to come as Star Seeker understood it. But they would also be trained, how to tame and order a particular wind, to capture a white light and use it to purify that which is foul and clean that which has rotted. And, Lieren said, to chase away the bad spirits and force them from the corpses they puppet.Star Seeker remembered how his master died. And felt destiny&#039;s pull as he listened to Lieren speak of a spirit called Hysh, whom had become his friend after he had freed it from the cave it had been trapped in. _The new members of the Nameless you&#039;re training, quickly adapt to wielding Hysh&#039;s light in place of their own souls&#039; power. And with a few objects touched by chaos and a few corpses of those befouled by it, they are able to practice and learn how to use the White Flame to purify and wash away the corruption of Chaos and the warp, from the smallest of its manifestations. It is a small beginning, but every journey begins with one step. You continue having them practice and use the power to wash away safer energies as well as cleanse small chips of warp stone and render them safe and sterile of corruptive energies, without any of them undergoing or experience even the subtlest of mutations. They&#039;re small tests, petty experiments, to prove that Hysh can be safely wielded against the great enemy and to see how those who are not primarchs may harness its powers.They already know the null denouncement charm, how to write its script and use it to ward places and people, but showing them how the imbue the charm with Hysh energy increases the null denouncement&#039;s effectiveness and allows it to be used more offensively, even a script of paper fashioned like a talisman can be used to great effectiveness when it is charged with the White Flame. These are the practices you put them through before entering the Webway, having them prove they can purifying the slightest presence of chaos corruption and cleanse those items and remains that were polluted by its presence, that they can wash away mutative energies and render materials that express such taint safe or at least safer to handle directly.

He&#039;d called them expendable, but all of them have the right mindset to wield the Pure White Flame as a purifying force. They imagine the process in different ways. &quot;Grinning&quot; Abigail from New Varro, envisions washing clothes and wringing them out over white water rapids. Wrench-82 considers it as using flame to treat metal and burn off contaminants. The Vishnu Rishi dreams it to be a great saber carved of solidified fire. Meng from the Xue province, see sit as a anti venom, a curing salve to be applied and rubbed into boils and burns. And Star Seeker from Massacre, thinks of it as a white dawn that chases away the darkness like a panther does starving hounds. All of them are right, from a certain point of view.And all of them have experience resisting the temptation of chaos and fighting and slaying evil spirits. They had to, to join the Nameless, even if they are considered fresh recruits, they had endured the eight days of rigorous meditation and exposure to warp energy and then bested a wicked spirit in single combat. They simply had not received the cybernetic augmentations awarded to the successful recruits, yet, now had they been assigned to a school. Though you knew which they&#039;d join, after training them and getting to know each of them personally. Which makes their secondary instruction more difficult. Beating a daemon in combat, is in someways, more easily done than banishing it directly or exorcising and removing it from a vessel it has taken, and that is why you lead with showing them how to cleanse away chaotic taint and purify its presence and Qi first. As those will be good foundational skills for them to utilize in the process of banishing the warp born spirits.Another obstacle, is, of course, how to get them to functional and useable experience in banishing rites and exorcist techniques, you&#039;ve been teaching them the exorcist techniques you inherited from the Dai monks, the arts of the Cleansing Rain as well as the powers Arianka had blessed you with when she trusted you with a glimmer of her silver moonlight. Thus far, they have only grasped &quot;The Five Daggers of Winter&#039;s Embrace&quot; and are not ready for any more advance moves of the Cleansing Rain practice. And you have created variations of the most basic techniques of Cleansing Rain with Hysh, which you are considering to make a branch school of exorcism, out of respect for the Dai Monk&#039;s own practices and in recognition to the difference in movements and results between the two arts.

Attempting to heal this damage with magic requires a successful constitution save from the creature being healed.Each point of essence invested increases the damage dealt by 1.This relic is bound to your Hand Chakra. When a creature fails to be healed from the wounds dealt by this blade through magic, you deal damage to them as if you&#039;ve struck them with this blade. Tainted Bulwark (Body) - This relic takes the form of a skintight living bodysuit that can be worn beneath your clothes and armor. The first time a creature would deal damage to you in a post, you reduce that damage by your level plus your total essence (7). Each point of essence invested reduces all damage taken by 1.Chaps of the Pale Rider (Feet) - These riding chaps match the description of those worn by one of the legendary Four Horsemen, the dreadknights who slew Luminare in the name of the Demon King. Invoking this relic allows you to summon a pale horse that can stride upon water and snow. Each point of essence invested increases the speed of the summoned horse by 5ft (3mph at gallop, 1mph at trot)."

It&#039;s super effective!The column of seven riders approaches your camp slower than you would have expected. By the time they&#039;ve reached the adamant bulwarks that your skeletal forces have deployed, you&#039;ve had time to have one of your champions erect a pavilion to great them with afternoon tea. You forget how primitive things are out here in the boondocks, where none of their horses have been crossbred with angels or demons to grant them greater speed and endurance. Even the largest of them, rode by the only man wearing a proper harness, is still slow and winded compared to the pale horse you&#039;ve been granted as a summon.Still, for a steed with no magical weight to it, it&#039;s an impressive thing.So too is the man who dismounts from it. Tall and clad in steel, broad of shoulder and thick with muscle. A full head of blonde hair crowns his handsome face, and a thick mustache rests overtop his lips. Stern and wary eyes appraise your camp, drifting from banner to banner. His brow furrows with their unfamiliar sigil, until his eyes reach the banner atop Dormandal&#039;s tent; the general standard of the Dreadknight Legion.That banner is a field of gold trimmed in black, a black sword piercing through a seven-sided ring of eyes and fire in a death blow. A sigil made after the death of Luminare, representing the Four Horsemen&#039;s triumph over the Lord of Light and his angels. The banners that made his brow furrow were your own. A field of black trimmed with red, signifying your allegiance and loyalty to the Ravager and his legions. Upon the field, your personal crest. A golden skull in recognition of your training to command forces of the undead. A tangle of vines running through it to recognize your skill in defilement and corruptive magics. Two roses blooming from its eyes, showing your preference for making allies from your enemies.Their willingness, of course, is not a factor.&quot;Dreadknight...&quot; breathes out one of the cowards who chose to remain on his horse. The fear in his voice, the way his body shudders at the realization that their little rebellion kicked the hornet&#039;s nest, it brings a smile to your face. Especially when you see the lovely young woman with bright red braids hiding behind the men, her mare stepping backwards and her hands clutching a seven pointed star.They brought you a little treat. How lovely~&quot;Steady on, Grant,&quot; the burly fellow says. He finally turns his eyes to you and the pavilion set up outside the bulwark. You lounge upon a love seat that your skeletons set out for you, one leg kicked up over the armrest while the other hangs limply. He clicks his tongue at your unsightly posture and says, &quot;The Lord of Light is with us, and so are the Marcher Lords of the Thornlands. See, they don&#039;t like having an Imperial village so close to their borders, which is why they made us a sweet deal to swear fealty to Marquis Edel-&quot;"

Of course, you wouldn&#039;t have accepted that regardless; their heresy, their raising the banner of the Lord of Light is unforgivable. But it&#039;s fun to let them know how little you care for what allies they have. The Empire holds all the cards in war and commerce, its neighbors exist only because they are allowed to. &quot;Here I was hoping to welcome you back to the fold as brothers, and figure out over tea how we might brush this foolishness aside. But if that&#039;s not what you&#039;re here for...&quot;The burly man&#039;s eyes narrow. Alas, he can read through your bullshit, and knows in his heart that you never intended to let any of the villagers walk away with their free will intact. His companions, however...&quot;We can make amends...?&quot;&quot;The dreadknight is willing to forgive us?&quot;&quot;We should abandon the village while we can...&quot;&quot;Enough!&quot; the woman in the back silences the five men-at-arms whose whispers spoke volumes of their cowardice. Her hands tremble on the reins of her mare as she brings it up towards the pavilion. The burly man has a small smile on his face, is that pride? Perhaps in the woman he loves? That would be delightful. &quot;It... it was my father&#039;s oath that gave Bright Springs to the Empire, n-not mine. Father passed away in winter, and th-the Empire didn&#039;t send a representative. So when Marquis Edelweiss arrived with aid for my people, requesting fealty... how could I say no?&quot;The young woman&#039;s beauty stirred your lance the moment you laid eyes upon her. Her auburn hair, fair skin, the freckles dancing upon her face, the curves that her homespun clothing cannot hide... those excited you to be sure. But to see that she has such a sweet, dutiful soul... &quot;You put your people ahead of your safety. How admirable!&quot;It makes your whole body pulse with excitement.Even her chief guards&#039; words cannot dim your excitement when he stalks forward and says, &quot;You heard my lady. The people of Bright Springs owe their fealty to her, and the Empire never had her fealty to begin with. If you truly admire her dedication to her people, than take your forces back to the capital and leave our village be.&quot;&quot;Oh I truly admire her willingness to put her life on the line,&quot; you say, rising from your seat with a languid stretch. The armored man takes a step back, his hand reaching for his arming sword. The cowards serving him have their horses take a step back, almost ready to bolt. &quot;However, there is a rule that I am bound to, which I cannot forsake.&quot;Your intention clicks in the leader&#039;s head. &quot;We came under a banner of parley. Would you shame yourself and-&quot;He does not finish his sentence. Your blade - a black sword that oozes with demonic corruption - has pierced his throat. It leaves no wound behind as you slash his throat, though the profane energies that now course through him will be enough to see him dead... or turned."

        "text": "You fetch a change of clothes for the noble woman from your tent. Her current garb is far too modest for her new lot in life. The most flattering thing she wore to greet your army was the corset support her heavy bosom, and truth be told that was far more functional than flashy. The outfit you prepare is more appropriate to the role she shall be given in the Pits, having failed to uphold her ancestral oaths to the empire.Just looking at it fills you with nostalgia. Your mother&#039;s old working clothes, from your days living in the Pits of the capital city. Now, of course, your mother wears fine silks to work and entertains demons and gentlemen of refined taste at court. What she wears beneath those dresses are even flashier than this, but in those bygone days this was all she needed to wear to ply her trade.Flashy, flattering, and with fine gilding that implied a higher price for her services. Even thinly plated, gold chains upon a slave commanded a customer&#039;s attention.You kept them throughout your years as a squire, even after Dormandal found your mother a place as a courtesan to better match her daughter&#039;s status as a Dreadknight. A reminder of where you came from... and to where you could return, if your failures piled up too high too quickly. Lending them to your first trophy taken in battle - even if she&#039;s not cute enough to keep around - is a fitting use. How happy it is that she shares your mother&#039;s size!Besides, you have dozens of these outfits in storage. Your mother plied the old trade well enough that she never had to work in the stables for even a single night. She kept good enough track of her clients that you even know the man most likely to be your father. Knowing what her clients liked and didn&#039;t like earned her the sort of affection that saw her showered with many gifts; usually flashy outfits they wanted her to wear. The only one you&#039;ve no intention of giving to some trophy or another is the one she hand made for you, a few weeks before Dormandal raised you to the squire corps on a whim. That one you&#039;ll keep forever, as more than anything else it represents what could have been.That, and wearing it gives you a delightful thrill. She made it for your coming of age, and it still fits you well.&quot;Look at me, getting all nostalgic,&quot; you chuckle, putting the clean clothes in your bag. The lady has gone still on your shoulder, her eyes far away and despondent. You give her a smack on her plump rump to get her attention. &quot;Hey! Where&#039;s a good place to have a bath around these parts? Don&#039;t tell me your village is so backwards that you don&#039;t have a bathhouse...&quot;&quot;Huh...?&quot; Her voice is dazed and confused as she answers you. &quot;There&#039;s the hotsprings that are halfway up the mountain. It&#039;s said that they&#039;ve been blessed by the angels to restore the health of those who bathe there, but I don&#039;t believe those rumors are true...&quot;"

        "text": "&gt;&gt;6259556&quot;Well, we&#039;ll know soon enough,&quot; you tell her. She makes a confused sound as you step out of your tent, a bag slung over one shoulder and the lady slung over the other. When you click the spurs upon your boots together - relics summoned with your riding chaps - a pale horse leaps up from your shadow and kneels before you. Demon bred, far sturdier and swifter than the pathetic things those men-at-arms rode in on. Perhaps you&#039;ll reward him with the lady&#039;s mare later today. &quot;If there&#039;s any divine power in that spring, it will be tainted by the time we&#039;re finished bathing.&quot;As you slide up behind her on the saddle, she swallows dryly and finds the courage to ask, &quot;What do you mean by that?&quot;With a cruel grin on your face, you lean forward and press the whole of your body against her back, your chin coming to rest on the nape of her neck. She freezes in place when it suddenly becomes quite apparent at how excited you are to have her at your mercy. The lance the Ravage gifted you upon your ascension to knighthood is a mighty weapon indeed. In a mocking tone, you tell her that, &quot;You&#039;ll learn soon enough, my lady. And unless you want your people to suffer harshly, you&#039;ll keep your voice down the entire time, understand?&quot;She nods meekly as you ride off.When you arrive at the hotsprings, you show her exactly what you meant.Bright Springs, they named the village and the hotsprings from which much of their wealth derives. Hot water bubbles up from beneath the ground into a wide, expansive pool, rich with minerals and ripe with the subtle stench of divine magic. The water pours out from the great pool into smaller and smaller pools, forming a stairway of hot water that slowly begins to cool. Looking down from above it like watching a honecomb overflow with sparkling blue honey. Even as the sunlight wanes with the coming of dusk, the pools glimmer with light. Further proof of the rogue, unbound angels giving this place its blessing.You taint the hotsprings right at the source. Right up until dusk you leave the lady of this village with the vain hope that her meek obedience might spare her, but in truth you simply waited for the most powerful timing. Dusk is the triumph of darkness over the light, and as the sun falls your unbloodied lance claims its first victim. As the lady struggles to suppress the urge to scream at the indignities you make her suffer, your own voice sings out in wordless praises of the ravager for allowing your body to feel such resplendent joy. &quot;Oh...?&quot; Once the first round is up, you spot something in the water that excites you. The lady&#039;s maidensblood, mixing with your own midnight-black fluids at the heart of the spring, a profanity that makes the ritual to taint these holy waters all the more potent. &quot;You were a virgin? At twenty seven? How admirable!&quot;Floating listlessly in the water, the dead-eyed lady of the village softly asks, &quot;Are you done?&quot;"

        "text": "&gt;&gt;6259558The stench of divinity has grown weaker, but it has hardly faded from these waters. If you don&#039;t snuff it out completely, then it might eventually burn away all of your hard work. Where else will you find a virgin woman with such a powerful connection to the land, one born of her family&#039;s stewardship of these springs for nearly ten generations? Your lance deflowered this woman, and she has no siblings or heirs just yet. Further, any heirs of hers would be born in the Pits, severing the bond her family has with the land and making them useless for such a ritual.No, the only way you can be sure is to violate her in ways profane and brutal, until the light fades from her eyes and the color of these pools darken into a reflection of the night sky. Besides which, your lance stirs in anticipation of another round or three. Picking her up gently, you plant a tender kiss upon her lips that she tearfully returns. Then, holding her in a tight embrace, you let your true feelings into your voice and whisper. &quot;No.&quot;Pushing her down into the waters, you return to your brutal work with wordless praises of the Ravager upon your tongue.=================Dormandal is there at the edge of the camp when you ride back from the hotsprings, the flames in his eyesockets dancing ever playfully. The lady of the camp rides limply before you, all fire and spirit and hope replaced with a near lifeless fugue. Her mind is far, far away after everything you did to her. Her attitude nearly caused the ritual to fail, as once she stopped responding to the torments you inflicted upon her, your excitement waned. But you did your duty and finished the job.Her simple, homespun attire that she soiled in her fear has been burnt, replaced by your mother&#039;s old work clothes. Flashy and flattering, black with gold accents, the clothes suit her new lot in life and show off the profane gift that you gave her. Her charm has increased greatly, and the corruption has begun to run through her flesh. Soon enough she might even realize the joys her new life will grant her, though for now her spirit remains dreadfully dull and prudish.&quot;You look like you had a good time,&quot; Dormandal comments as you dismount. With a wry grin, he says, &quot;You&#039;re a few hours late to attack at dusk, though.&quot;&quot;I found something interesting in the mountains,&quot; you tell him. You motion for him to walk with you, as you carry the lady to your tent. &quot;A pocket of light that may have spurred a few hearts in this village towards rebellion, and the apostasy of Luminare. Our lady here helped me snuff it out... and even replace it with a font of darkness, a scar on the land from the Ravager. Did you know she was a virgin?&quot;&quot;At her age?&quot; Dormandal looks as surprised as you were pleased at that discovery. &quot;How admirable.&quot;"

        "text": "&gt;&gt;6259561The Empire does not prize virginity as much as its neighbors did, so meeting a virgin approaching thirty is a rarity indeed. Women have no shortage of eager partners, and men can visit the stables and punish the disobedient if they can&#039;t find love or afford something better. A few strive to keep theirs, believing it will enhance their magic powers if they make it to 25 or 30 without knowing the touch of a lover, but those folk are considered quite eccentric. While this was your first time wetting the lance the Ravager gifted you, you&#039;re a twenty nine year old woman. You&#039;ve had your share of lovers.&quot;Now, what do you plan to do with her, I wonder?&quot; Dormandal asked a rather personal question, though you don&#039;t mind. He&#039;s more of a father to you the man who impregnated your mother, certainly. &quot;You dressed her in your mother&#039;s clothes... out of convenience, or affection? Some Dreadknights enjoy keeping their first trophy around, even as others toss them away. What will you do, Lady Clearwater?&quot;You shake your head to the negative. &quot;She broke too easily. I can hardly call a broken toy a trophy, can I? I might keep her around as a camp follower, but she&#039;s too weak to stand beside me. No, I think I&#039;ll give her to the men as a morale officer. After all, the corruption will drive them wild if they don&#039;t have a proper outlet. Best to give them one, right?&quot;&quot;Of course,&quot; the old lich says, his voice echoing with amusement.You give her over to the corrupted men-at-arms that you brought to your side, leaving her in the capable hands of the man you assume she called out to for help. Detlev, you believe she named him. That almost brings back a glimmer of hope to her eyes, but when they start peeling your mother&#039;s clothes off of her body, her mind goes right back into hiding. No doubt she&#039;s trying to convince herself that her new reality is a nightmare. Considering how weak willed she is, you suspect it will only take a week or so for your profane gift to take its toll upon her psyche and bring her around to a better way of thinking. One where she not only accepts her lot in life, but embraces it wholeheartedly. You almost wish you could undo the death stroke upon him when that happened, to taste his despair at seeing what his lady has become.For now, though, you need to focus. Turning to one of your skeletal champions, you command, &quot;All companies prepare for battle. We raze Bright Springs to the ground. Leave the children unharmed, they are not responsible for their parents&#039; treachery and can be reeducated. As for the men and women...&quot;&gt;Kill them all.

Truth be told, had they not been so eager to throw their lot in with the Thornlands and waited until their defenses finished construction, it would have saved you a major headache. The curtain wall erected around the Bright Springs stands a mere ten feet tall. More than most villages can boast, but hardly enough to keep your forces from routing a force of disorganized peasants.The problem comes with the fact that the wall is half finished. The village&#039;s east end is as naked as the sows sentenced to work the stables of the Pit for a fortnight, and it presents a target that&#039;s nearly as tempting. With four companies of runecarved skeletons, you could amass your forces at the east to give them a right good pounding, shatter their spirits and raze the village to the ground. Like a sow in the stables, the village would get wrecked.But also like a sow in the stables, the work would be sloppy.Realistically you won&#039;t be able to kill them all. Even in a proper siege, taking the walls and turning them against the people within the village, some of the people you&#039;ve been sent to punish would make it out alive. You push in from the east with your full force and they&#039;ll slip out of the village on the north and south roads. Sending skeletons to control the roads would still leave the western wall uncontested. Another avenue for the vermin to escape.After staring down at the battlemap for a little while longer, you nod to yourself and place your pieces on the board, letting your mind&#039;s eye envision the proceedings. You will not claim to be a tactical genius, but you know the game well enough to understand how the battle ought to go.&quot;A company to each side?&quot; Dormandal looks over your battle plan with the purple flames that flicker in his eyes. &quot;Hmmm... and how do you plan to use your forces? Surely you don&#039;t intend to try for an encirclement?&quot;&quot;No,&quot; you say with a shake of your head. &quot;The company at the western wall will attack first. I want them spread out, making enough noise to draw as much of the militia as possible... and to have the rest begin the evacuation. I doubt they&#039;ve drilled it well, but if I were a rebel I&#039;d have more of a plan to flee than scatter and get cut down. They know our camp is to the south, so they&#039;ll push the northern road and the openings to the east. The first and second companies will be waiting meet them before they can flee.&quot;You smile to yourself. Not as sloppy a job as the stables, but still as messy as your old mum after she worked a wild party. That&#039;s acceptable.&quot;A company to distract, a company to threaten, and two companies to slaughter them as they retreat,&quot; Dormandal nods at your proposal. &quot;Not a bad use of your forces at all.

They&#039;d hardly be able to put up an effective defense, wouldn&#039;t they?&quot;You shake your head. &quot;Then they&#039;d scatter like rats. I want them organized in their evacuation of the village, it makes a fatter target for my forces to slaughter.&quot;&quot;But you must admit, it would send a powerful message,&quot; Dormandal counters. That&#039;s something you considered, razing the village to the ground and reducing it all to ash, but in the end that&#039;s not your style. &quot;Survivors fleeing, spreading news of the hellfire that awaits those who betray the Empire. Striking fear into hearts that might rebel against our masters&#039; rule can be quite the preventative measure.&quot;&quot;Which is why I want them to know that death or worse awaits them,&quot; you tell him. &quot;Without walls to corral the herd, a sack only kills a fifth of the population at most. I don&#039;t want eight rebels running free when I&#039;ve only killed two. I want one rebel to slip away after I&#039;ve killed nine of his brothers. I don&#039;t want this to be another story of a town burned to the ground, I want whispers of a slaughter so thorough that barely a man is alive to tell the tale.&quot;Cormandal gives a rattling laugh. &quot;Hah, forgive this old man for trying to lighten his workload, with how many corpses I&#039;ll need to reanimate.

I would have thought that you would have... oh. Ohoho! I see your game. What a splendid scenario you&#039;ve set up, I&#039;d expect nothing less of the young woman I chose to raise from the Pits.

They did not dedicate as many forces to responding to your attack on the western wall as you would have liked, but the militia did not succeed in breaking through in either the northern or the eastern fronts. The Third Company did break north to flank the retreating civilians with the First and Second, but few if any civilians broke south to escape in the night. The Fourth Company performed above and beyond your expectations, thanks in large part to its commander - the skeleton of an old barbarian warlord whose warband the Empire put down a century ago. They did not just make noise and draw fire, no, they used their iron claws to scale the wall and slaughter the defenders down to a man.

It sits just off the center of the village, atop a hill that gives it a commanding view of the river and the road that cuts through the village going north. You cannot quite call it a proper keep as the tower rising from its northwest corner lacks the fortifications you would expect. Nor can you call it a simple manse, for the walls are thick and sturdy enough for a siege. No windows sit on its lowest floor, and its second floor has only slats for shooting arrows sealed with easily removed panes of glass, yet the third floor and the highest room of the tower have grand glass windows for each room.Double paned, even. The Brightspring family spared no expense to outfit their home, and yet their taxes to the Empire fell off right around the time their patriarch perished this past winter. At least, that&#039;s what all the documents say. Poor revenues reported... when they had a blessed spring nourishing the land and the rejuvenating bodies of their people.&quot;Treason and tax fraud,&quot; you drawl. Yanking on her shackles, you pull the Lady Brightspring close enough for her to squirm at your attentions, especially when your hand finds some place soft and delicate and gives it a squeeze. &quot;The list of crimes you&#039;ve committed keeps piling up, my lady. Tell me, were you hoping to be punished? Because someone&#039;s been a very naughty girl~&quot;Try as she might to squirm free of your iron grasp, the Lady Brightspring cannot escape. After a moment, she realizes the futility of her struggles and goes limp, staring up at the moon and stars. &quot;It was Brother Anthony&#039;s idea. Cut our payments to the Empire and they-&quot;&quot;Will slaughter your men, rape your women, and brainwash your children into serving their dark masters, yes,&quot; you finish the sentence for her. Grabbing her by the hair, you pull her towards another window, this one looking over the village square. Your skeletons are hard at work, stripping the flesh from the bodies of militiamen and civilians alike. &quot;Well, as a woman myself, I decided to spare them the indignity. Their bodies will serve the Empire all the same, once their bones have been dipped in iron and carved with the right runes.&quot;&quot;You didn&#039;t spare me that indignity,&quot; she spits. &quot;No I didn&#039;t,&quot; you tell her. Honestly, the solidarity you claimed was absolutely false. A part of you sorely wanted to claim every virgin woman in the town as your plaything - at least until your bored of them - but that would have distracted your forces from the slaughter. Needs must, and so all those ladies got to die virgins instead of learning the carnal pleasures of the flesh. &quot;But isn&#039;t it fair that the person responsible for this slaughter suffers the greatest for it?&quot;&quot;Hah!&quot; a bitter laugh escapes her throat. &quot;If that&#039;s the case, then you will burn when Luminaire is reborn to judge the sinners. In the deepest, most fiery pit of hell, a bleak and unending Tartarus...&quot;"

I was going to let you sleep with me tonight and enjoy the comfort of a nice, cozy bed after we went for a few rounds. But now I think you&#039;ll be staying in the dungeon, shackled and naked with the doors wide open for my new recruits to do whatever they want with you.&quot;Lady Brightspring glares up at you with gritted teeth, but doesn&#039;t say a word. She knows that you can make it worse on her if you want to.You stare into her blue eyes, your smile becoming wide and cruel. &quot;Of course, they already know what you&#039;re good for, don&#039;t they?&quot;=================As tempting as it was to have your way with her in the dungeons before letting your recruits loose on her, you manage to restrain yourself and keep your lance within its sheathe. They way she glared at you just there, where was that fight in her when you took her virginity? The shock must have worn off. Her treatment at the hands of her former comrades may have broken her so hard that they fixed her, to a degree. Whatever the case, it made her all the more delicious. Your desire to see her spirit finally buckle under the pressure of her circumstances and the corrosion from your profane gift swells, but you ultimately decide to leave it to your subordinates.After all, you know better than to take their sloppy seconds. Who knows where they&#039;ve been?Claiming the largest room with the biggest and coziest bed in all the manse for yourself, you get a restful night&#039;s sleep. With the dawn, one of Dormandal&#039;s skeletal maids wakes you with a delightful breakfast of eggs, beans, bacon, toast, and tomatoes. The tomatoes are especially important - being the undisputed king of vegetables - and you are quite glad that some were found among the food stores of the manse. While your army might not march on its stomach, its commander does, and having troops that don&#039;t need to eat means that better care can be put into what rations are made.Once you are fed, washed, and fully harnessed, you proceed outside rested and ready for the most important part of any sacking of a village: the pillaging. Marching to the town square, where the corpse pile has shrunk and the bleached bone pile has substantially grown, you begin to bark out orders. &quot;Fourth Company with me! We&#039;ve an inventory to take of the village goods. First through Third, continue stripping these bones for Lord Dormandal. Your brothers-in-arms will not animate themselves!&quot;The skeletal commanders of the First through Third Companies give a rattle of laughter, joined by the more clever troops under their command; skeletons old and storied enough to begin developing personalities."

Taking inventory is not dangerous work now that the sack is complete and the villagers have been slaughtered, but you refuse to break from procedure for the sake of getting things done a touch more expediently. Lines of string have divided the village into six sectors. &quot;Squads of four everyone, and the commander and I will move as a pair. I want to take inventory of everything that hasn&#039;t been nailed down. The commander and I will set up the main hall to sort trade goods, textiles, coinage, and the like. Foodstuffs to the larder. Meats to the freeze room, perishables to the cold room, and nonperishables to the pantry.&quot;&quot;And what if there are any survivors?&quot; Dormandal drifts over to you, another question in his bones. He wears something lighter today than yesterday, airy pants and actual boots meant for walking, with a shorter hooded robe left open to reveal his ribcage. His sleeves are long and billowing, and the whole ensemble glitters with starlight. Lady Liches must love him, for he is flaunting his exquisite bone structure. &quot;How shall your forces deal with them?&quot;&quot;Survivors hiding out are why we do a five point room scan,&quot; you say, more to the skeletons than Dormandal. The commander nods, and the bone boys all rattle obediently. &quot;No breaking of procedure. If you don&#039;t do a five point room scan, and some brave fool charges out from the closet and cracks open a skull, that&#039;s on you, gentlebones. That said, I suppose if they prostrate themselves and beg for mercy, we can afford to show some.&quot;&quot;Why not slaughter them like before?&quot; Dormandal prods at your decision. Wisely, for you shouldn&#039;t do things on a whim without thinking about it.&quot;They neither fought back, nor tried to flee their punishment,&quot; you say after a moment of thought. Sure, it&#039;s rationalizing the whim - not ideal - but talking through it creates a foundation for your actions and establishes precedent for the next sacking. &quot;That is behavior that we should reward. Demonstrate sincere submission and earn forgiveness. The mark in the ledger shall remain, but clemency shall be granted.&quot;&quot;I see,&quot; Dormandal nods after a moment. &quot;There is no sheep&#039;s blood upon the doors, but if the spectre of death has already passed...&quot;&quot;Of course an exception would be made if the mastermind hid themselves away,&quot; you tell him. &quot;Conspirators who raise gather banners against the Empire shall know no mercy from our blades!&quot;"

        "text": "The six squads of skeletons begin their pillaging of the village at your order. While your runecarved skeletons lack a fully formed mind as undead no more than a handful of decades old, clear orders and procedures mean that you can rely on them to get the job done for most of the village. They know where to bring any goods they find, they know where to bring any captives they find, and they know how to do a five point room scan and slaughter anyone foolish enough to try waiting in ambush for them.The one place you don&#039;t trust them with is the temple. Not yet, at any rate.The seven pointed cathedral that looms over the northwest quarter of the village needs your personal attention, and so you&#039;ve dragged the commander of the Fourth Company with you. He has a greater presence of mind than his subordinates, not quite breaking past the mindless nature of the ordinary skeleton, but approaching the threshold of becoming a skeletal champion. Though he may well be a one hundred year old weapon of war, you would say that he&#039;s certainly the most reliable of your skeletal commanders.Which is why you feel comfortable bringing him into a nexus of divine energy. The temple is an old and storied place, for the material plane. Civilizations passed it between them, renovations changing the meaning of its seven points and the figures in its stained-glass windows, but the stone of its foundation is older than most of the faiths it played host to. Seven great kings of man became seven earthly spirits. Seven earthly spirits became seven stars of heaven. Seven stars of heaven became seven faces of a pretender to the Throne of G-d. That pretender&#039;s seven faces became seven pretenders themselves, and when came the Dies Irae upon which the Dividers poured into the world and butchered the false gods, those pretenders became seven of the six hundred and sixty six Divider Lords. When the village raised banner of the Seven Archangels in rebellion against the Empire, the statues of those Divider Lords were torn down and broken into a thousand pieces.Or at least that&#039;s what Dormandal told you, when you asked him about the village two nights back. He tends to know these things.You fingers brush along the baptismal font at the heart of the building, where water drawn from the mountain hotsprings bubbles up. Still warm to the touch despite the distance from the fires at the heart of the mountain, still tainted by your impromptu ritual to desecrate the blessings laid upon the water by the &quot;angels&quot;. Angels using that priest Lady Brightspring mentioned, that Brother Anthony who pushed the village into rebellion. Thoughts cross your mind as you contemplate the unholy water and the way it has stained the fountain&#039;s white marble a delightful black. None of the corpses placed upon the pile for processing wore the cassock of a priest or brother. You made the village&#039;s liege a toy for the pits, but if she was already a puppet of someone else..."

At least you got to claim that useless bint&#039;s virginity... not that a limp dicked priest with a vow of chastity has the balls to even get it up. &quot;Alright, here&#039;s what we&#039;re doing,&quot; you tell your partner in pillaging. The skeletal commander rattles forward, the red flames in its eyes eager to receive your orders. &quot;We go around each wing and pick it apart piece by piece. Anything that looks like a sacred relic of that stinking corpse - if you even catch the tiniest whiff of divinity on it - we dump it in the font of unholy water here for desecration. If we find holy books in the pews, we pile them up outside for burning later. Everything else gets brought back to the manor to get sorted out with the rest of the treasure.&quot;The skeletal command shrieks out a confirmation of your orders, and the two of you get to work. Scouring the seven naves of the temple only reveals a handful of sacred relics, and a small pile of holy books set out in the courtyard to be burnt later in the day. They had not replaced the stained glass in the windows just yet, though you do find a collection of empty iron frames set to be filled with patterns to revere the renegade archangels. A few windows - likely the ones that once held the image of the Divider Lords - are broken and shuttered, but they can be replaced with time.The traitorous worms at least had the common decency to leave the floor polished and untouched. The tile patterns you walk upon are not simply patterns memorializing the many priests that once congregated their flocks in this place, no. You tread upon the caskets of revered fathers and brothers, men of holy and unholy persuasions alike having been laid to rest in the floor of this storied building. Dormandal boasted about its historical significance on the journey over of how you would walk upon tombs of three hundred generations of spiritual shepherds. A hundred generations of whom revered no false gods, and instead honored the Divider Lords, the demonic masters of the Empire. To see it turned into a wretched hive of rebellion against the ones who tore down the false heaven and slew the pretender gods fills you with a burning desire to desecrate every book and symbol of their ever-so-holy corpse personally. And with great vigor.An urge you bite back. You cannot skip the process, you must be methodical in eradicating every trace of their heresy.Then, once you have scrubbed away all evidence of Luminaire&#039;s influence, you can drag the Lady Brightspring onto the consecrated altar and desecrate all night long with her violation."

        "text": "&gt;&gt;6262167Once you finish with the naves, the choir, and the main body of the temple, you move down into the undercroft. Among the honored servants laid to rest here, you find that the rebels squirreled away weapons. Weapons that bear the makers mark of the Edelweiss Forgeworks, a crafthall sworn to the service of the Marquis Bernadotte von Edelweiss of the Thornlands. Corpse worshipper that he may be, this isn&#039;t solid evidence that he backed the rebel scum, just a very strong hint.For better or worse, the Edelweiss Forgeworks are second only to the Pit Forges of the Industrialist in terms of output and quality. A distant second, for Imperial Steel is far and away the finest quality in all the world, but they do have customers among all their neighbors - even Imperials living on this plane who are looking to buy things cheap might buy from them. There are cheaper on other planes, of course, but the point stands. You can&#039;t rush into declaring him their backer with this evidence alone, however.Besides, more concerning than the steel in the undercroft is all the barrels of gunpowder. Firearms are nearly exclusive to the Empire and its allies on this plane, and the windbüchse is the standard for a number of reasons. The least of which is that the vessels for containing air pressure and the means to pressurize them are far more difficult to reproduce than gunpowder. A dozen barrels of not just black powder, but corned gunpowder, is not a lot of it, all things considered, but it would be more than enough to blow the roof off of this cathedral.After calling over some of the bone boys to take it out of the temple and place it somewhere more disposable, the last part of the temple grounds that you check over is the stables. You expect to find a number of things there: livestock, animal feed, maybe a station to help fix up a horse&#039;s broke or infected hooves.You did not expect to find a young woman sprawled out over a pile of hay in the loft. With a head of messy blonde hair burnt red at the tips, she wears a tartan shirt, a pair of craftsman&#039;s coveralls, and a set of gloves and boots. Despite how much noise you make, she remains asleep... no, there&#039;s no way. Could she have slept through the entire battle?&gt;Wake her up and demand to know who she is.&gt;Wake her up and gleefully inform her that she&#039;s going to help you desecrate the temple.&gt;Pinch your nose and have your skeletons carry her off to the dungeons. Make sure she has a good view of Lady Brightspring.&gt;She looks so deliciously vulnerable that it makes your lance stir with hunger. Maybe just a taste...&gt;No mercy means no mercy.

        "text": "No small part of you wants to drive a sword through her throat as you did with your new recruits. To watch the light fade from her eyes as her sclera melt into a midnight black, to see the corruption that swells within your blade seep into her veins, to render her existence into a tarnished half-life of mindless servitude to your every want and whim. She lays there upon the hay sprawled out, vulnerable, and defenseless as your heart pounds in your ears with the desire to defile her. It would be so easy, so simple, so delightful to ram your blade straight through her and take from her all the things that she was and will be. Your chest heaves, your breath becomes hot and heavy, your murderous and carnal impulses blend together until they become indistinguishable from one another. The woman lying among the hay is no great beauty, her features plain and cute at best. Yet her raw unguarded vulnerability drives you to an insatiable hunger that sets your eyes to devour her sleeping body. Past the dopey smile upon her drooling lips, beyond the pillow-soft valley that lay betwixt her freckled mountains, they find even more tempting targets that set your bloodlust aflame.Her precious carotid is right there in the open, all but enticing you to give it a squeeze.She best not think you can&#039;t see what&#039;s hidden beneath the grease-stained overalls that conceal her bosom, no. Her aorta and inferior vena cava are just hanging out there, without a single plate of armor to protect them, begging for you to drive your blade in straight to the hilt.And with one of her arms flopping lackadaisically high above her head, she can&#039;t have done this accidentally. The way she shows off her armpit - and more importantly, the axillary vein beneath it - is far too lewd. Those are the things that dreams are made of, dreams of crawling through the mud of a rain soaked battlefield and climbing atop the broken body of a heavily armored foe who has fallen and cannot get up. The weary acceptance of their fate, the intimacy as you stare lovingly into their eyes as your blade slowly slides through the gaps in their defenses left by the joints in their harness.The gasp of their final breath.The embrace of the little death.It takes every ounce of your discipline to hold yourself back. If you were the sort of woman who gave into her impulses, you would have already had this deliciously vulnerable woman pinned beneath your arms and begun stabbing her. With your blade or with your lance, it doesn&#039;t matter. Both are raring and ready to go, one rippling into your hands as the other stirs within your codpiece. When you see such delectable vulnerability, your heart&#039;s first desire is to destroy it.But you hold yourself back."

        "text": "&gt;&gt;6263135For a number of reasons, the least of which being that if you had your fill of fun with her and it turned out that she was - in fact - a loyal citizen of the Empire who just happened to be passing through the town at the time of the sack, you&#039;d get chewed out. Not the fun sort of chewing out that you and your pillow friend back in the squire corps female barracks, either. No, it would be the uncomfortable sort of chewing out where a they&#039;d have a panel of stuffy parsons make you explain yourself, and then tell you that what you did harmed the Empire and that you should contemplate your actions.Oh, and you&#039;d probably get reassigned someplace boring, probably guarding some peaceful world in the material ruled by the Industrialist and his corporate worker bees, where the most excitement you&#039;d run into is someone&#039;s dog getting into the alchemical waste process and turning into a ravenous were beast. There&#039;s also the fact that, upon closer inspection, her choker and her overalls reek of magic. Not acrid stench of divinity you caught from the relics left bathing in unholy water earlier, nor the cinnamon sweet scent of the demonic power that courses through your veins and your equipment. Her equipment - and to a lesser extent, the woman herself - smells faintly of lilacs and thunderstorms, a hallmark of the arcane. Hardly an unpleasant odor, not like a stinking paladin, and certainly not as overpowering as Dormandal&#039;s own... but the airs of the sorceress and the artificer are ones that you&#039;ve learned to respectful of.So you give her a very gentle kick with your sabatons, more of push really, and shout, &quot;Oi, lady, wake the fuck up! It&#039;s past noon. Get your shit together and tell me who you are, lest you and your shit want to get got and thrown into the dungeons!&quot;&quot;Mwah, bud I dun wanna, mum...&quot; the young woman rolls with your shove, eating a face full of hay without opening her eyes. Honestly it&#039;s almost impressive that she&#039;s still sleeping, with such a wide smile on her face the whole time, despite how loud you&#039;re shouting. &quot;S&#039;my berfday, ya know? An&#039; the berfday girl get&#039;s ta sleep in as loooooooooong as she wants. I&#039;m gonna sleep and dream the whole day away~&quot;&quot;No, you are not,&quot; you inform her. Maybe if you push on her face with your boot, she&#039;ll wake up and answer you&#039;re questions. &quot;You are going to wake up on the count of three, or I swear to the Ravager I will drive my blade so deep inside you that your ancestors will feel it.&quot;You don&#039;t really mean it, that&#039;s just the sort of thing the knight you served under would say when you overslept."

Where the hell did she get off make such an adorable sound, huh? &quot;No professor, I was payin&#039; attention ta yer lecture, honest. &#039;M jus&#039; a little sleevagy is all... the hyperborean theorem?

Something about the way this young woman is speaking gets under your skin, like the knife of the inquisitor who taught all the squires how to resist torture. &quot;Never mind. Ahem. One...&quot;At the sound of the number, the young lady&#039;s brown eyes snap open.&quot;Sweet Accuser I&#039;m gonna be la-,&quot; she jolts up from the pile of hay in a panicked scramble that comes to a grinding halt when she sees you looming over her. Clad in your black harness trimmed with red, your lips curled into a scowl while your blood red eyes glitter with bloodlust from beneath your perfectly combed pale-gold bangs, you must certainly cut an imposing figure to wake up to. She gives a nervous chuckle and says, &quot;Well I guess I know who won the big scrap those idjits were raring for. I told &#039;em it wouldn&#039;t end well, the Empire don&#039;t send the sort of lady knight that&#039;d lose against a ragtag buncha rebels. I suppose this means there&#039;s only one thing for me to do...&quot;She tugs nervously at her choker, an act that makes you narrow your eyes. In a flash of dark flame, your blade is next to her throat. You do not press it to her flesh, but you do keep it close enough to prick her precious carotid if it comes to it. &quot;And just what would that be, I wonder?&quot;&quot;Easy, easy, not doin&#039; nothin&#039; that I can&#039;t take back...&quot; with a nervous smile on her face, she raises her hands and shows you her empty palms. A meaningless gesture from someone with arcane power, but at least her hands are away from whatever artifice she wears about her neck. You almost relax, but then - in a blur of motion that you can barely follow - she...Bows her head to the ground, her forehead resting on the back of her hands in a gesture of complete submission. Her voice comes out somewhere between a desperate sob and a frantic plea shouted at the top of her lungs. &quot;Please don&#039;t kill me, Miss Imperial Knight! I promise I can be useful to whatever plans you dastardly Empire folks have for these lands, whether it&#039;s kickin&#039; puppies or pillagin&#039; temples or whatever it is you wanna do! I got some book learnin&#039; and I know how to tinker, and if you don&#039;t need any of that I can cook for you and clean! So... please don&#039;t kill meeeeeeeeeeeee...&quot;Pathetic.This woman is so deliciously pathetic."

Like a kitten or a puppy mewling for help. Such noises are beneath the dignity of a Dreadknight, however, and you manage to cover it up with a choking cough. &quot;Ahem. What are you doing?&quot;&quot;This is my most sincere way of begging for my life, ma&#039;am!&quot; she declares with such absolute confidence that you almost forget that she was sobbing not a moment before. &quot;I see that you have many shiny bone boys out there, and I would prefer not to have my bones join theirs for at least another fifty or sixty years. When I&#039;m all shriveled up and dyin&#039;, I wouldn&#039;t mind donatin&#039; my bones for somethin&#039; like that, but I&#039;d like to hit ninety before then... or even a hundred! So I am pleadin&#039; for my life as best as I- wait, hold on.&quot;Nearly as quickly as she prostrated herself before you, she sits up and undoes her boots. Once those are taken off and set aside, she stands up and undoes the clasps on her coveralls, letting them fall to the floor and stepping out of each leg. Before moving on to the next article of clothing, she very neatly folds them and places them next to her boots. This whole situation vaguely reminds you of things your mother would do for the clients she brought home. You liked those clients, because they&#039;d always bring you a new toy or some nice clothes because it made your mother happy, and a happy mother was far more enthusiastic in her work than a grumpy one.Naturally, this woman did not possess the grace your mother had in such displays. Honestly, with how mechanically she was taking everything off and folding it neatly before putting it to one side, you&#039;re not sure if this was meant to be a display. Not in the same way your mother&#039;s were.&quot;Seriously, what are you doing?&quot; you drawl. &quot;That has the be the most pathetic strip tease I&#039;ve ever seen, if that&#039;s what you&#039;re trying for...&quot;&quot;It ain&#039;t,&quot; she declares, before dropping to her knees. &quot;Why would I strip tease for a lady? Even if my tits were the best in my hometown, it&#039;s not like I&#039;d expect &#039;em ta do anythin&#039; for ya... and even if it did, it&#039;s not like you&#039;d have the sort of equipment that I&#039;d know how to... anyways, see, I read this in a book. What ya saw before is step one to my most sincere pleadin&#039; for my life. But they say that if ya get nekkid, fold your clothes up nice and neat and lay them out next to you, and then prostrate yerself before someone, it&#039;s even more sincere!&quot;She takes a deep breath, throws her hands down before your sabatons, and drops her head in a solemn bow. &quot;Pretty please don&#039;t kill me. I - Tiffany Tentaphon - swear that I shall do whatever you want me to, so long as you let me live!&quot;A thought percolates in you mind. Your sneer turns into a smirk, your lance twitching in excitement as you ask, &quot;Anything?&quot;"

I&#039;d gladly gut her like a trout, just try ta fuckin&#039; stop me.&quot;You raise an eyebrow at her answer, &quot;And what if I asked you to torture your Pa to death?&quot;&quot;Then I&#039;d feel sorry fer the poor guy you found what looked like him,&quot; she tells you. There&#039;s a hint of sadness in her voice, that for the moment is absent the manic pathos that&#039;s been filling it for most of your conversation. &quot;Pa died of mana poisoning late last year, that&#039;s why I left old Pinetown ta make my way to the Empire and maybe find some work as some noble&#039;s pet artificer.&quot;Taking a deep breath, you come to your decision. She does not have the scent of a liar upon her, and she&#039;s so deliciously pathetic that you just want to devour her like a cake. Unclasping your codpiece, you let it drop to the floor with a loud clank that makes Tiffany flinch. &quot;Then rejoice, Tiffany Tentaphon. I, Lady Saligia Clearwater of the Dreadknights, shall not only spare your life this day, but shall fulfill that wish of yours. From this day forward, you shall be my pet artificer. Now raise your head, and complete the pact.&quot;&quot;Wh-What do you mean, complete the pact?&quot; She asks, slowly raising her head off the floor. &quot;Are you gonna make me drink your blood? Am I gonna need to drink your blo-&quot;Her words die in her throat when she sees your mighty weapon staring at her, perfectly level with her eyes as she keeps on her knees. You look down at her with a sadistic smile on your face and tell her that, &quot;You&#039;ll be drinking something of mine, yes.&quot;&quot;Holy shit.&quot; She swallows dryly, awe and excitement at the sight of the gift the Ravager gave you plain upon her face. She rubs her eyes, for a moment not quite believing that it&#039;s real. You give her plenty of time to come to terms with it, and when she does... &quot;Thank you for sparing me, Lady Clearwater! Allow me to show you how I enthusiastically express my loyalty~&quot;=================&quot;I see you&#039;ve found yourself another bedwarmer,&quot; Dormandal seems amused when you bring a rather bow legged Tiffany back to the Manor.&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; you ask with a tilt of your head. Tiffany gives you an odd look, but that melts away into a happy blush when you grab her by the shoulder and pull her possessively close. She&#039;s your unkempt ball of failure and pathos, and the two of you know it. Addressing Dormandal&#039;s question, you tell him that, &quot;Tiffany&#039;s the only bedwarmer that I have right now. There&#039;s the toy in the dungeons, I suppose, but that treacherous vixen isn&#039;t going to be warming my bed anytime soon.

Again, compared to his peers from this segment of the material plane. More than your average petty king or prince, less than a proper royal.There is a good chance he has a court wizard and artificers who can provide effective protection against scrying, which means that even if he didn&#039;t do it, the coin would not be able to tell you. To compare to District 4973 (the portion of the empire that Brightsprings sits on the North-Eastern edge of):District 4973 has a total population of 46.3 million people, the vast majority of whom live 673rd Pit of Beleth. The 673rd Pit of Beleth has a diversified economy whose largest segment is the services industry, though like most Pit-Cities in this segment of the Material, its economy does not interact much with the surface. Instead, most trade operates through the Hellgate network at the bottom of the Pit. Its surface city, with a population of approximately 250,000 people, is its primary interface with this segment of the Material Plane, and it mostly serves as a trading hub for &quot;Setting Appropriate&quot; goods produced in the greater Empire. Counting only the surface city, the total population of the district is 1.7 million.&gt;&gt;6263324&gt;Also, are banshees capable of performing &quot;relief/morale&quot; duties?With the right items, yes.

Especially after they segregated the barracks by sex because too many of the female recruits were slacking on their training to be barracks bunnies (Saligia did not slack off, but she was a bit of a barracks bunny, being her mother&#039;s daughter and all).Also, here&#039;s a map of the region! Not quite to scale."

        "text": "Tiffany joins you in the master bedroom for the evening, which gets you thinking about the future.For now, Tiff is the only trophy you intend to keep. You know a guy back in Beleth who would pay premium for a Material Born noblewoman, even if she&#039;s well and thoroughly used by now, so Lady Brightspring won&#039;t be joining your collection. That said, it&#039;s traditional for a Dreadknight sworn to the Ravager to have numerous conquests throughout their careers, and to keep some of them close at hand. Rapacious conduct is not just expected, but encouraged by that order, so long as it does not directly harm the interests of the Divider Lords and the Empire. Eventually your collection will grow big enough that each trophy will need its own space in your stronghold. The Manor has plenty of rooms on the upper floors, so you won&#039;t run out of space to divvy out any time soon, but the thoughts still come to you as you lay there beside your deliciously pathetic prize. There&#039;s a clarity that your lance grants you, once its finished its work, and it leaves you thinking about such things.The future of your collection. The expansion of your stronghold. The safety of the toys that you decide are yours alone. Those thoughts come unbidden and remind you to make use of the coin that you found earlier this morning.Holding it to you mouth, you whisper the question: is there any more gunpowder cached away in the village?.When you flip the coin, it comes up tails. You can rest a bit more easily now that you know the only building that might explode is the warehouse where the skeletons stored the barrels you found beneath the church. Though now that you&#039;re relaxed, it&#039;s hard to ignore the soft ball of putty sleeping next to you. Sleep doesn&#039;t come to you for a while longer yet. For Tiff... well, you learn that she&#039;s either a very heavy sleeper, or very good at pretending.=================Morning finds you in an exceptionally good mood. Besides doing this and that with Tiff for a bit before the two of you got out of bed, the skeletal maids drew a nice hot bath for the both of you to clean up. Dormandal joined the pair of you for breakfast - strawberries, cream, and waffles - though he only drank a glass of milk that mysteriously disappeared down his non-existent gullet. It&#039;s good for the bones, he said, without any further explanation. After talking through your plans for the day, he and Tiff went off to build some wards for the village while you finish up the desecration of the temple.Which leads you to the present, where you&#039;ve gathered up some maids and ventured down into the manor dungeon. The Lady Brightspring lies broken and bowlegged on a pile of filthy blankets. She reeks like a whorehouse and looks worse off than that time your mother stumbled home after she and Aunt Meredith worked a fraternity&#039;s graduation party. You new recruits sure have stamina!"

        "text": "&gt;&gt;6263715Still, the odor offends you. So you went all the way over to the temple, filled a bucket with unholy water from its baptismal font, and left it in the freeze room while you penned a letter to your friend in Beleth.My dear Varten,The spiders haven&#039;t eaten your guts yet, have they? Well, I suppose if you&#039;re reading this letter that means they haven&#039;t. Well, unless they&#039;ve crawled up into your brainmeats and wove a web around your neurons to assume direct control. If so, I send greetings to our new parasitic arachnid overlords, and would like to remind them that as amazing as my body is, the Ravager&#039;s blessing has made me immune to their control.Anyways, how you doing, friendo? I hope the creepy crawlies are still responding well to the arachniphonos and haven&#039;t been giving you too much trouble. An enterprising fellow like you is an asset to the Empire, and every day you gotta lay up in the hospital is a day we&#039;re all worse off. I&#039;m still keepin&#039; an eye out for any weird plants that spiders don&#039;t like, though I know the last one turned out to be a dud. Next one will drop them all for sure!(If our new arachnid overlords are reading this, that was a joke. There is no search for a spider killing plant.)The campaign&#039;s going well. We took the village two nights ago, though I&#039;m willing to bet that there are still some rebels out in the woods. I&#039;ll be sending them off to meet their dead god soon, don&#039;t you worry. In the meantime, I found something of interest that I know you might be in the market for. Material born noblewoman, dead to rights because she wove the flag of rebellion. Can&#039;t say she&#039;s a virgin anymore, I took care of that myself for a few rituals and have had her on relief duty ever since. But material born noblewoman is still material born noblewoman, and I bet you know a few guys who&#039;d love a traitor to torment. Let me know if you&#039;re interested and send me a quote. Because you&#039;re a friend, I&#039;ll hold off on putting out any other feelers until I hear back from you, and if you&#039;re offer&#039;s good enough she&#039;s yours no questions asked. I look forward to doing business with you, friendo.Anyways, give my love to Hanah and Jane!Your pal,-SALIGIAWith the letter penned, you seal it with your insignia and then raise the hand that wears your Dreadknight signet. The black diamond set into the gold swirls with blood red flame, and from it a black raven springs forth into the world. A reliable messenger that you can summon four copies of at a time, which can carry letters unerringly to anyone whose face you know and then return with their response. Varten&#039;s ugly mug you know quite well, so the bird grabs the roll of parchment and flies off towards the 673rd Pit of Beleth."

Your voice practically sings out your greeting to the dazed and dead-eyed noblewoman as you splash her with the bucket of ice cold unholy water. &quot;Wake up, you treacherous cuntwaffle~!&quot;A pair of skeletal maids enter Lady Brightspring&#039;s cell after you douse her with cold water. With mops and buckets with gently scented soapy water, the pair of them begin to scrub the sputtering noblewoman clean. She glares up at you as the two skeletons roughly swab her body clean, her bright blue eyes almost glowing against her sclera, which have been stained black. Her arcanovascular system runs thick with the corrupted essence that you and your new recruits have poured inside of her over the past two days, a taint that she will never be free from. &quot;What do you want from me...?&quot; she glowers, not even bothering to hide the precious sights left on display. A smile creeps onto your face as you spot the pinkness in her cheeks that tells you that she hates this less than she would like you to believe. She puts on a scowl, but with the way that blush goes all the way down to the mark you engraved above her womb... &quot;Don&#039;t you worry, Lady Brightsprings! I just need you to help me with one more ritual, and then I&#039;ll leave you to your role as morale officer for a little while longer. Unless you like the way I&#039;ve been treating you?&quot;Her face turns red and she cannot look you in the eye. All she can do is look away and seethe, &quot;Fuck you.&quot;&quot;That&#039;s the plan~!&quot; you tell her. With a snap of your fingers, Detlev and one of the burlier men-at-arms come out from the shadows behind you. &quot;I&#039;m gonna fuck you right on the alter that you and that pesky priest spent so much time and treasure consecrating! I&#039;m evening going to put the men who swore oaths to protect you and your family to the task of holding you down while I do it. That ought to desecrate whatever consecrations placed upon the temple, wouldn&#039;t you say?&quot;&quot;Tch...&quot; Lady Brightspring still puts up the act of defiance despite all the changes brought by the corruption of her essence. Wouldn&#039;t it be easier on her if she just gave into her instincts? You&#039;ll need to engrave that lesson upon her. &quot;Do what you will to my body, but you will never sully my spirit. The Brotherhood of Seven Stars will take back the village, and they&#039;ll give you a death that&#039;s far too clean for someone like you.&quot;So there are leftover forces in the woods..."

        "text": "&gt;&gt;6263717You didn&#039;t intend to interrogate her, but that&#039;s a useful piece of information to know. Even if the militia failed to escape - she knows the extent of the slaughter - there&#039;s a force out there which she expects will avenge her. A part of you wants to ask after their numbers, but you strongly doubt that she was trusted with that sort of operational intelligence. A competent force would compartmentalize as much information as they can. If a Dreadknight would not be trusted with the knowledge of how many forces her district can bring to bear, a puppet-mayor would not have such information about a rebellion.Instead of asking about that, you give her a cruel smile and remind her that, &quot;Even if they could kill me, that wouldn&#039;t restore your virginity, you know. You&#039;ll have to live with the fact that someone you hate stole it from you, forever~&quot;Before she can try to say anything witty in response, you have you new recruits gag her and carry her from the cell. You have a temple to desecrate, and Lady Brightspring&#039;s connection to the land - however tenuous it becomes with every defilement you foist upon her - makes her the perfect partner for the ritual. You follow them after donning your harness, though it almost feels like a waste when you&#039;ll need to remove the codpiece so soon. Well, this is business, not pleasure, and your armor is your business suit.Maybe in a few months you&#039;ll be confident that you can walk around the village without needing to wear your full harness.=================The conclusion of the desecration leaves you satisfied and filled with the same clearheaded vigor you felt after last night&#039;s dalliances with Tiff. Lady Brightspring, on the other hand, is left in an unsightly bowlegged pose as your mixed passions seep out from betwixt her legs and stain the sacred altar with a vile corrosion that shatters the consecrations left upon them. The disrespect towards their seven angels, the treatment of the liege lady whose family shepherded the land for centuries as a common whore, and the fact that by the end of things her face twisted into a grotesque expression of wanton pleasure... all of those things piled up to invert the enchantments.The protection against demons has been inverted into a ward against angels.The blessings meant to encourage the throngs of people to be at peace now stokes the flames of their base instincts.The relics meant to produce alms of food... still do so, actually, for such bland, tasteless, nutritious fare pleases the Industrialist for its efficiency."

Her wardrobe primarily consists of red-trimmed women&#039;s togas woven from white pseudo-silk, common fashion in Upper Tartarus. She wears the same cut as her mother, where the toga opens at the waist to leave a leg fully exposed. The last person who said that the cut made Saligia look like a whore quickly learned that the cut also allowed her to kick high enough to break said woman&#039;s nose - something a more modest cut would not allow.Officer&#039;s Camping Kit - A kit containing the standard issue equipment for a knighted officer in service to the Imperial Military. This contains the officer&#039;s personal standard, a pavilion tent with six lightstones, a collapsible table, a large tent with two lightstones, two cots, six all weather blankets, a five gallon shower system with a firestone, two mess kits, a kettle, a firestone hotplate. Rations - Standard shelf-stable rations issued to Imperial soldiers on campaign within this segment of the Material Plane. Due to the heavy use of undead soldiers upon this world, the logistics division is able to focus on quality over quantity for its living officer&#039;s corps. These rations are designed for field use rather than consumption at a held position, unless that position has been dimension locked and cut off from logistical supply chains. Their shelf stability is good for a ten year period in normal conditions. She was issued three of each menu for this campaign.&gt;Menu A: Meatballs in Gravy, Roast Potatoes and Veggies, Pound Cake, Berry Preserve Spread, Cheddar Cheese Spread, Snack Bread, Electrolyte Drink Mix, Coffee Mix x2&gt;Menu B: Bowtie Pasta in Meat Sauce, Beans and Greens in Red Sauce, Tip of the Spear (tm) Bar, Parmesan Squares, Dried Apricots, Snack Bread, Nojito Drink Mix, Coffee Mix x2&gt;Menu C: Chili with Beans, Cornbread, Jalapeno Cheese Spread, Whole Wheat Snack Bread, Fudge Brownie, Dried Kiwi, Nojito Drink Mix, Coffee Mix x2&gt;Menu D: Brisket, Garlic Butter Mashed Potatoes, Cookie (Chocolate Chip), Peanut Butter, Berry Preserve Spread, Snack Bread, Electrolyte Drink Mix, Beleth Cream Cappuccino x2&gt;Menu E: Chicken Burritos, Spiced Peaches, Berry and Nuts Mix I, Tip of the Spear (tm) Bar, Cheese Spread, Hot Sauce, Whole Weat Snack Bread, Nojito Drink Mix, Coffee Mix x2Windbuchse - The standard issue Imperial long arm weapon for this segment of the Material Plane. This weapon uses pressurized air bladders to launch .45 caliber bullets at a speed of 200 m/s. Its tube magazine can hold 20 bullets, which is the amount of shots that a fully charged air bladder can fire at useful pressure. While durable enough for field use, these weapons are not currently standard issue for mindless undead."

Most sets are of a semi-living variety, designed to respond to the wearer&#039;s growth and preferences in armor. It can change configuration to a more form fitting Parade Armor - sometimes derided as &quot;boobplate&quot; or &quot;armor abs&quot; - from its more optimal battlefield configuration at the wishes of the wearer. The differences in effectiveness against most weapons is negligible enough that the configuration does not impact the wearer&#039;s AC.Dreadknight&#039;s Signet - A golden ring set with a black diamond and personal insignia, granted upon graduation from the Squire Corps. In addition to serving as a badge of office, it allows the dreadknight to summon a messenger raven to carry letters and other correspondence while out in the field. These ravens can reach most anyone on a Cradle-Equivalent World within a week of flight - with some flights being much shorter - and will wait for a response before returning to the Dreadknight. A Dreadknight can have a number of summoned ravens equal to their Charisma Modifier (minimum 2); attempts to summon additional ravens will simply fail. A raven can only be sent to someone the Dreadknight knows, and they can be instructed to vanish upon delivery rather than waiting for a response.Impurity Seal (Hands) - A seal that boosts the power of an invoked Weapon Relic in its associated chakra, increasing the weapon&#039;s enhancement bonus by +1Coin of the Truthseeker: This coin of wrought iron bears the seal of an ancient king that once ruled over these lands, before the Empire conquered them. You may whisper to it a single question and flip the coin, and the result shall give you a truthful answer. When it lands showing the old king&#039;s head, the answer is yes. When it lands showing his seal, the answer is no. If the question has no correct answer, or if the answer is hidden from divination magics, the coin lands upon its side. Once flipped, the magic leaves the coin until the next day dawns.Safety Decanter: This crystal decanter is used by nobles to prevent assassination attempts. When a liquid is poured inside of it, all poisons are removed from it, making it safe to drink. Should the poison (or pathogen) be unable to be removed for any reason, the liquid will instead turn black.CoinageSalary - As a Dreadknight of the Imperial military and a command officer, you draw a salary of 30 silver denarii a week (equivalent to one month of unskilled labor).Pension - The Industrialist and the Autocrat have implemented a pension plan for all soldiers. After 50 or more years, for every 10 years served, a soldier is entitled to a silver denarius a day.Loot - 5000 silver denarii worth of gems and coins taken as your share from the village.&gt;&gt;6263783Yes they can!"

        "text": "&quot;Where are you off to in such a hurry?&quot; Dormandal catches you on your way out the South Gate. He and Tiff appear to be working on the creation of a Wardstone as you pass them by. Tiff has set up next to the wall with her engraving tools, carving a pattern into the stone in accordance with a design set out on parchment by Dormandal. Her butt wiggles happily as she goes about her work, lost in a trance of deep concentration as her tools perfectly carry out the design. While she carves, Dormandal brews the substance that will fill the etching that Tiff creates: a blend of mithral dust, worldtree sap, and other materials that when combined create a waxy paste that conducts magic well. &quot;A second company patrol got wiped out in the southern forest,&quot; you explain. Your pale horse comes to a halt with a squeeze of your thighs. The three squads of 4th Company bone boys that you intend to bring with you rattle to a stop as well. &quot;I sent out the new recruits to fill in for the patrol, but I intend to skewer the seditious, treacherous, insurrectionist rats who think they can defy the Empire and live to tell the tale myself.&quot;The purple flames in Dormandal&#039;s eye sockets flicker in concentration, &quot;I see. And what if they intend to draw you out and cut you off from the main body of your force? Overwhelm the lone Dreadknight with numbers?&quot;&quot;Don&#039;t worry, Dormandal, I did my homework,&quot; you say. Your horse trots over to his table, disappearing in a puff of smoke when you dismount. Rolling out a piece of parchment, you show him a map of the patrol areas. &quot;The patrol disappeared about two miles off the southern road, here, according to the 2nd Company&#039;s commander. Recon from third company estimates that force that wiped out the 2nd Company patrol is a single armed unit with between four and eight members. There were no signs of reinforcements, and the armed unit did not seem in a rush to return to base.&quot;&quot;And I saw the other half of 4th Company take their leave of the village half an hour ago,&quot; Dormandal says with a twinkle in his eye.&quot;I sent the Commander out for some recon-in-force,&quot; you explain. Three black pieces appear from your bag, set down on the map. You move them through the woodlands in a particular pattern, one where the three squads remain within eachother&#039;s lifesense while casting a net over the area, so to speak. One that would push your target towards the southern road. &quot;Either the enemy is completely oblivious, and we&#039;ll have their location for a raid, or the Commander will drive them right towards the anvil I&#039;m preparing.&quot;Dormandal contemplates the map for a moment before nodding to himself. &quot;So you won&#039;t be cut off from your forces, but you&#039;re allowing yourself to be drawn out - if that is their plan. The strategy you set up is quite sound, but why leave the village when you don&#039;t need to? I doubt there&#039;s reason for you to be a part of this &#039;anvil&#039; you&#039;re setting up for the 4th Company.&quot;"

        "text": "&gt;&gt;6264224&quot;Why is Tiff hand carving your rune into the wall&#039;s load bearing stone?&quot; You ask Dormandal in return. His teeth move in a way that vaguely reminds you of a wry smile, as that&#039;s just the sort of rhetorical question he would normally ask you. &quot;The hands of a craftsman are a magic of their own, and the greatest of them truly love their work. My craft is violence, and as splendid as my skeletal soldiers are, mine own hands are my favorite tool. Tiffany, would you have lowered yourself to etching that sigil with an acid, when you&#039;ve two good hands to use?&quot;You hear the sound of a hammer and chisel clattering to the ground. Tiffany can be seen staring at the fruit of her labors, and then down at her hands with a look of dismay carved onto her face. &quot;Fiddle-fucks! Are you telling me that I could have been using a solvent for this the entire time? I thought that magic stuff had to be done by hand, otherwise... that was three hours of my life, wasted...&quot;&quot;Don&#039;t fret, don&#039;t fret,&quot; Dormandal&#039;s deep voice echoes. &quot;And don&#039;t fetch any acid etching tools. The acids with clog up the stone&#039;s pores, very good for a shiny table finish but terrible for the rune to bind. Keep at it, Miss Tentaphon, you&#039;re doing great.&quot;Somewhat despondent, Tiffany returns to her work.For a minute or two, silence reigns over the air as you and Dormandal both turn your eyes to the map, contemplating the pieces without contemplating what they stand for.&quot;My point still stands,&quot; you finally say, breaking the awkward silence.&quot;Does it, now?&quot; Dormandal sounds amused.&quot;A solvent can certainly carve rock with less effort than a chisel.&quot; You readily admit that it would certainly be easier - and in some ways, more efficient - for you to leave the slaughter to the 4th Company and remain in the village for other work that needs be done. &quot;Yet just as the solvent would ruin the surface for binding your concoction...&quot;Dormandal lets the words hang for a moment, before nodding. &quot;I see, now. You&#039;d rather twist the stronger ones to your bidding than add them to the bone pile. I cannot deny that Mr. Detlev is far more impressive than most skeletons, though his companions much less so.&quot;&quot;If you want their bones for something, feel free to flay them,&quot; you tell Dormandal.He brings a bony hand up to his chin for a moment, stroking a beard that is no longer there. &quot;Perhaps if one of them is killed. The Ravager&#039;s corruption brings about physiological changes in its victims beyond its effects on the arcanovascular system. Your bones, for instance, are far more durable than average. Working with the corpse of one of you minions might prove to be a very fascinating endeavor.&quot;"

What sort of reinforcements can I expect, once you get around to working on them?&quot;&quot;Well, I&#039;ll be replenishing the second company back to full fighting strength first and foremost,&quot; Dormandal reassures you. Raising skeletal warriors from bones that have been prepared takes little time at all, so that won&#039;t eat into his work all that much. &quot;Once I&#039;ve finished designing the wards for Miss Tentaphon to build, I think I&#039;ll make you something a bit more interesting than platoons to bring you to double strength.

        "text": "&gt;&gt;6264121As this anon here has guessed &gt;&gt;6264318 the Empire (as it is commonly referred to) spans across multiple planes of existence, and the spectrum of what technologies get deployed where is context sensitive and subject to the various treaties that the Empire is signatory to. While the largest faction in the setting by far and arguably the most advanced, the Empire is beset on all sides by numerous foes that they cannot simply crush without leaving themselves vulnerable to a devastating counterattack.The treaty that prevents full-blown tech supremacy is the Treaty of Ascalon, which was actually signed to restrain the Remnant of Luminare from using their most advanced technologies and magics on worlds that are not near peer. This treaty was metaphysically binding and went both ways, however, so even though the Empire has caught up with - and in many places exceeds - the Remnant, they must use equipment and magics that the locals can understand. Basically, they can be 2-3 eras ahead of the locals. The Native Americans were more or less stone-age, but despite memes they came to understand (and love) firearms rather quickly, so the lowest you&#039;ll see the Empire going is what you&#039;re at right now. Early modern tech with air bladders subbing in for gunpowder to avoid giving the locals explosives.Logistics stuff (the Rations) is a bit more flexible, especially on worlds where magic sees frequent use. The Empire has spent the time since its founding (upon the Dies Irae, where the 10,000 pretenders to the Throne of G-d were cast down by the forces of Hell) pushing these treaties to their absolute limit. I won&#039;t give &quot;exact words&quot; because I know Anon is smarter than me and will find a loophole that isn&#039;t written if I do, but consider every game-breaking bug to have been found and been exploited in your favor. The Pit of Beleth on this planet will be one of the places where you will more freely see the Empire&#039;s Tech in use. Not on the Surface City, and not for waging war, but you&#039;ll see more of the civilian technologies available there. Saligia isn&#039;t super-spoiled by technology because she grew up in Deep Tartarus. Even though Tartarus is one of the core districts of Hell itself - where all power of the Empire converges - Deep Tartarus only really benefited from the sort of logistical tech that she can access in this section of the Material Plane anyways. Food preservation and storage, modern fabrics and textiles, medical care; when you&#039;re Pit Born you&#039;re not rich enough for leisure tech or the more expensive weapons tech.Also, did a bigger version of the banner with a more detailed skull. I think the vines came out more like a green ribbon than what I intended, though..."

        "text": "&gt;&gt;6264405So the Treaty of Ascalon was signed very shortly after the Dies Irae, with its signature being considered the end of the Dies Irae. Luminare (the last of the 10,000 pretenders) was gone, the forces of Hell were zerg rushing planets across the Material and putting untold quintillions of people to the sword for the sin of worshipping pretenders to the Throne of G-d, the Empire had just seized Luna, and the Cradle was going to be next. To avoid bombing the birthplace of humanity to a lifeless hunk of rock and acid, the Remnant and a few other factions came to the table.The weapons limitations were (one of) the concessions the Empire squeezed out of the Remnant during the negotiations of the end of that conflict. Probably the biggest of them at the time, because it meant that the Remnant could only deploy their (limited) superweapons in a very select number of situations rather than using them to flip an already decided game. The Remnant got a few concessions out of the Empire as well, including a clause that prevented Demons from chain summoning one another into the Material (limitation also applied to Angels, but they were less reliant on it). This made mortals a much more important part of Hell&#039;s war machine than previously, thus programs like the Dreadknights.After all the cattle trading at the negotiation table, the Empire came out with enough of an edge that while their expansion slowed, it did not stop.Meanwhile, the Remnant got the big thing they wanted, which was the designation of the Cradle and its solar system as a protected neutral zone that will not be targeted by any faction. Even with it now deep in Empire Territory, members of all factions can freely make a pilgrimage to it... from one of the designated border worlds, aboard unarmed transit run by the governing body of the Cradle System. Though the biggest reason they signed it was for the war to end."

A force no more than five men strong would not have been able to wipe out a patrol of four runecarved skeletons without casualties unless they took extreme care in their approach. Not unless one of them possessed strength and magic that would put them on par with a Dreadknight. Though intelligence did not report on the rebel scum having any exceptional individuals among them, you cannot rule the possibility out. And honestly?The thought excites you. Detlev and his men-at-arms put up such a disappointing resistance when they approached your camp. Detlev possessed the only pair of balls between the six of them, though he unfortunately lacked the ways and means to back them up. The rest turned tail and fled despite knowing they were dead men walking. They could have done you the courtesy of taking a swing, entertaining you, but they instead proved to be twice as pathetic as Tiffany and not half as attractive. The idea that one of them might give you the first proper fight you&#039;ve had since graduating from the Squire Corps leaves your heart ringing in your ear and sets your blood aflame.Before you can think a second thought about traps and ambushes, the Blade of the Defiler has leapt from its scabbard and into your hand hand. The bone boys stand at the ready, so you ride down the line and tap your blade against the tips of their spears. When you reach the end of the line, you thrust the black blade forward and shout: &quot;Fourth Company, forward! No quarter, no mercy! Only death to those who oppose the Empire!&quot;The skeletons shriek their battle cry, bones rattling as they slam the butts of their spears against the hard packed dirt of the road.Then you are off. The pale horse between your legs whinnies as you urge it forward with your thighs, its black coat and golden mane like a streak of ebon lightning as it blitzes through the woods. Behind you the clatter of steel armor and ironclad bone follows behind, your soldiers keeping in their diamond formation despite the thick undergrowth that would have slowed a force of living soldiers down. Your warhorse tramples the weed and the thicket with ease, rushing ahead a full speed as it feels your excitement and bloodlust over the summoning bond.Such is your excitement that you may have left your skeletons behind, your eyes forward and your mind putting the fact that even tireless ironclad bones cannot keep up with a pale horse crashing through the forest at speed. You charge forward without subtlety or fear of what lay ahead... and when you catch the scent of their campfire in their clearing, you have the pale horse circle around. If you remember the terrain from the map, there&#039;s a perfect little hillock that overlooks the clearing with a short cliff, and...Yes! There it is. You guide your pale horse to the edge of the cliff, turn it slightly to the side, and pull back hard upon the reigns."

You raise the Blade of the Defiler to the sky in perfect timing with your steed&#039;s roar, allowing its shadow to cast a darkness on the camp below. Your voice carries far upon the wind as you call out to its occupants, &quot;You whom have trespassed against the Empire!

Three are men, two are women. The men are all rather nondescript and ordinary folk, the sort of fellows that the nobles of this world could pick off the street of any village, shove into a set of piecemeal armor, and call them levies when the time for war came. One of the women is dressed in the modest uniform of the Brides of Luminare, an order of priestesses with vows of chastity that you think you will enjoy breaking for her once all of this fighting is done. Though she may have already broken it, considering how clingy she&#039;s getting with the other woman. That one has a rich tan and a mop of messy red hair. Her dress leaves you a bit wary, as you can smell the enchantments upon her armor. While it might look like flashy and revealing swimwear, it&#039;s an anchor for a constant Mage Armor effect that convinces you that she&#039;s a spellsword of some sort.The three men exchange glances with one another, before they all turn as one to the tanned woman like good minions looking to their superior for orders.&quot;Well, Big Sis, we gonna listen to this gal?&quot; one of the men asks. He&#039;s the burly one, with a morningstar accompanying his piecemeal armor.&quot;We&#039;ll follow your lead, captain,&quot; the second man says. He&#039;s wiry but strongly built, with a thin sword in his hands. &quot;She&#039;s just one Dreadknight, I bet we can take her!&quot; the youngest of the men says, stars in his eyes and an expression of admiration on his face. That earns him a glare from the priestess, who rather possessively throws herself onto the shoulder of the spellsword and says, &quot;Big Sis knows that, you idiot! There&#039;s no one in the world who can defeat Big Sis, especially when I&#039;m healing her. Now go be useful and shoot your bow at the interloper. Maybe take a blow for Big Sis so that she can get the killing blow and you can die tragically.&quot;The red-haired woman pats the nun on the shoulder. &quot;Now, now, there&#039;s no need for that, Stella.

You catch the slits of her pupils without the sweet smell of demonic taint, marking her as someone with dragon blood. She almost certainly has the power to back up the swagger, but so do you. The only reason you let her mosey forward and speak her peace, instead of simply running her down is that you&#039;ve realized that you left your skeletons in the dust.

Letting you know that this Lord Kettleburn is paying them to chip away at the undead you&#039;re using to occupy the village clearly violated some adventuring protocol or another. You&#039;ll need to look up that name once you get back to town. Learning about the rebel&#039;s backers is almost worth losing a squad of your precious bone boys... almost, but not quite. Certainly more important than killing these five, though if they&#039;re as balanced a group as the spellsword claims then they might make for good minions...Almost as good as your crack company of skeletons. Your eyes spot the Commander in the woodline opposite your approach. He read the mood, having the rest of the skeletons hold back until you give him a signal. After all, the more these fools keep talking, the more information they might let slip.&quot;Dammit, Clint,&quot; the spellsword shakes her head, before raising her sword to you. &quot;Sorry Miss Dreadknight, I was gonna be sporting and let you run home and bring back your army so that I might get a good fight out of this. Clint&#039;s gone and spoiled that, though, what with dropping our employer&#039;s name. So if you could do me a favor and drop your weapon so I can kill you all painless and clean like? Or better yet, don&#039;t do that, and let me have a little fun with ya before the end.&quot;&quot;Funny, I was going to say the same thing,&quot; you tell her. Looking down on her from atop the cliff, your eyes meet, and you can see your own bloodlust reflected in her. &quot;Drop your weapon and choose a clean death, or face a fate that&#039;s a bit more... messy.&quot;"

It&#039;s a strong love. A beautiful love. A love that&#039;s powerful and terrible as the ocean&#039;s black abyss. A dark love. A love that crushes like a mace. And when I&#039;m done sharing that love with you, I&#039;ll share it with that nun that clings to you so tightly. Perhaps I&#039;ll let you watch as I show her the love that the Divider Lords have given unto me. And when I&#039;m done with her, perhaps I&#039;ll share it with Clint as well! He&#039;s awfully pretty for a man...&quot;Your words are earnest.Your words are genuine.Your words are calculated to provoke this woman&#039;s disgust and rage. The reactions of her companions, especially when you talk about Clint, are delightfully amusing. Seeing the color drain from their faces as you threaten them with... well, the fun that comes after your victory, it stirs your heart and your loins the same. The way she seethes is perfect, and you know you&#039;ve won when she growls, &quot;You psychopath, you think you&#039;re being cute?&quot;&quot;Bitch,&quot; your sword cuts through the air in a wide arcing gesture... and stops to point directly at the Commander. &quot;I&#039;m adorable.&quot;At your words, a rain of black-headed arrows bursts from the tree line, well aimed and flying in rapid succession. Within a matter of seconds the woman&#039;s compatriots have fallen to the ground, either dead from the keen aim of your skeletal warriors, or making themselves a smaller target against the ceaseless volleys of arrows. The &#039;Big Sis&#039; turns in shock, and you waste no time taking advantage of the opening. However strong she might have been - and from the scent of the arcane wafting off her, she was strong indeed - a well trained warhorse is a terrible and mighty weapon. Your pale horse does not tire from a gallop, it does not flinch from the sound of a gun or the point of a hastily raised sword. It leaps from the cliffside and crashes through, slamming into the woman with all of its mass. Her sword clatters uselessly against its armor, and the sheer force of the collision sends her tumbling limp to the ground. Its hooves crash at the barrier created by that flashy armor she wears as it gallops by, pushing her into the mud and muck. The cracked barrier is left weak enough that your sword pierces through, enchanted by the Impurity Seal stamped onto your pauldron. The wound you leave does not strike her vitals, but the corruption seeps into her body all the same. With every foe down, the skeletons pour in from the forest and surround those who still live."

But I can&#039;t picture an entire civilization (a multi-planar one at that!) being able to keep itself together for long solely through state-mandated rapemurder.To actually run an empire effectively for any appreciable length of time, you need a high level of organization and delegation, reliable internal audits to keep corruption in check, a a solid supply chain not just for your military but for the civilians - to provide relief to areas struck by natural disasters or droughts, for example - and above all else (while also being a consequence of everything else I mentioned), a core population that is largely content, meaning their basic needs are met, their lives are stable and mostly predictable, and generally they&#039;re in a good enough situation financially, socially, or what have you, that they&#039;d be loathe to risk all of it by attempting rebellion.Which to me says that either the demons in charge of the Empire lean a lot more Lawful than they do Evil - which seems to be supported by some things the QM mentioned, such as pension plans for veterans or Saligia being concerned about facing actual consequences if she accidentally rapemurders a loyal imperial citizen.Or alternately it&#039;s all just handwaved as mass mind control that makes everyone just sort of accept that Aunt Jermionie got nabbed in the street by a gaggle of mad cultists and carried off to become the daily sacrifice to the Ravager, cause that&#039;s just how things get done in the Empire."

Looking through the thread:Prisoners of war can end up being forced into working at military brothels.Standard operating procedure had them refuse parley (with rebels).Prostitution/Sex Slavery isn&#039;t uncommon, and poorly performing sex slaves end up in &quot;the stables&quot; (sounds like locked in fetters and subject to a rape train)Their magic system has rituals that benefit from the rape of a virgin.Standard operating procedure is to avoid harming children.In at least one case, they turn the corpses of their defeated foes into soldiers.They also have some sort of social workers to take care of the orphaned children from a rebellion. Because, you know, they slaughtered all the civilians.Based on Saligia&#039;s words, Standard operating procedure for crushing a rebellion is &quot;slaughter the men, rape the women, reeducate/brainwash the children&quot;.Even the deeply chaotic evil Saligia emphasizes following procedure, big point towards a Lawful culture.There&#039;s definitely some religious stuff going on where the Empire believes they are the good guys.Accidentally killing a citizen doesn&#039;t carry too major a punishment, but she will get &quot;chewed out&quot; for breaking the Empire&#039;s things and reassigned someplace &quot;boring&quot;.The roads on the area map scream &quot;Lawful Culture&quot; at the very least. The moment you&#039;re in Empire territory it becomes straight, neat lines.&quot;Rapacious conduct is not just expected, but encouraged by that order.&quot; So an entire order of Dreadknights has rape and murder as Standard operating procedure. A slaver is considered &quot;an asset to the empire&quot;.Logistics for Civilians and Military seems decent enough. Her Civvy clothes sound like artificial fibers are fairly standard, showers are expected enough that they make portable military ones, there&#039;s a wide variety of food mentioned in the emergency/you have been cut of from supplies rations, and they can make air pressure tanks easily enough that they can deploy them instead of (more easily copied?) gunpowder in medieval settings.They have pensions for soldiers at the very least.Seems like whatever it is they have is capable of supporting advanced tech.My take would be that they are Lawful for the sake of doing more Evil. Probably with a big side of bread, drugs, and circuses to keep the population dazed and content."

In unison, they all come to a halt, the tips of their spears not an inch away from the unguarded flesh of your new captives. &quot;Bind and gag the mage. Shackle the warrior and the ranger, and bring them here.&quot;With efficiency and precision, the 4th Company follows your orders. They bar the arms of the sorcerer behind his back, binding him not only at the wrist but at the fingers as well, lest he try making somatic components of a spell. A spare horse bit gets used for the gag, forced between his teeth and strapped on tightly behind his head. While one squad deals with him, two more shackle the injured men with irons and drag their near-corpse bodies to you and Stella.Taking the pair from your skeletons, you roughly throw them at the priestess&#039;s feet and command her to, &quot;Heal them.&quot;She stares at you in confusion as you walk away, towards where the leader of these adventurer&#039;s lay. The tanned woman&#039;s breathing has become ragged, the corruption of your blade spreading through her body like wildfire. The priestess hesitates, still processing your command. You ignore her confusion, pulling the leader up by the roots of her crimson hair and dragging her body over to the rest of the group. Only then does the priestess finally think to ask, &quot;What?&quot;&quot;Did I stutter? Heal them, you useless priestess,&quot; you growl at her. &quot;Or are you incapable of even that much?&quot;&quot;No, I...&quot; she starts, but one glare from your baleful crimson eyes cuts off any backtalk she might have given. Her hands glow with the warm radiance of life magic, stitching the wounds of her comrades together. &quot;Why are you having me heal them?&quot;&quot;Because I want them to watch,&quot; you tell her. With a smooth motion, you undo the clasps of the spellblade&#039;s armor, leaving her body exposed. Stella and Clint both make a horrified sound as you roughly grab one of the twin peaks that their &#039;Big Sis&#039; so arrogantly displayed with that flashy armor of hers. &quot;I want all of you to watch as I punish her defiance, and understand the consequences of opposing the Empire.&quot;Another motion unclasps your codpiece, and when she sees your intention, Stella can only say: &quot;What the fuck?&quot;"

Such pure and honest hatred he directs at you, it&#039;s enough to make your maidenly heart flutter with joy. Despite his adoration for the &#039;Big Sis&#039; you&#039;re defiling right before his eyes, he&#039;s thinking of you and all the things he&#039;d do to you if he had the chance.You really hope he&#039;s thinking of paying you back in kind.He&#039;ll never get the chance to pull on your hair or push you into the dirt and make you his woman, but if a man doesn&#039;t dream of grasping things beyond his means, can you really call him a man? Better than uselessly barking about how they&#039;ll get you back for this someday.Stella&#039;s reaction is the best. Watching her lover slowly transform into your plaything as you relentlessly brutalized her broke something inside of the priestess. The tears that had streamed down her face dried up an hour ago, replaced by a dead eyed stare into the distance. Dazed and listless and filled with such a sweet and delicious despair that you just want to drink it all up. Had her lover been a maiden, you would have delighted in splattering Stella&#039;s face with her maidensblood, however the spellsword was not nearly as admirable in that regard as Lady Brightspring.Honestly, that&#039;s more understandable than Lady Brightspring having been a maiden of twenty seven years before you took her. The spellsword flaunted her body with that flashy armor of hers, but the arrogance in that act did not come from showing off the goods. Her goods deserved to be flaunted and enjoyed by everyone who saw them. The arrogance came from trusting an armor spell to protect her from attacks that were more about a difference in mass than the ability to break through a barrier.&quot;P-Please...&quot; the spellsword groans beneath you. &quot;You&#039;ve made your point, just kill me already... it hurts...&quot;Ah, she came to, right as your profane gift and the corruption from her wound began to mingle. Black ichor has crawled through the veins of her arcanovascular system, held back from her neck by an annoying piece of metaphysical biology that takes time or effort to bypass. The corruption has spread throughout her body as far as it can without assistance. Which means it&#039;s just about time to end things. Though before you do, you pull her hair and lift her off the ground. Her body&#039;s reaction and the flush on her face tells you all that you need to know. &quot;Don&#039;t lie to me. It doesn&#039;t hurt, it feels good doesn&#039;t it?&quot;&quot;Go to hell,&quot; she spits, not wanting to give you the satisfaction.

All that needs to be done is a gentle prick at the nape of her neck, to force open the chakra that protects the mind and soul from corruption seeping in through the body. To taint the essence that flows through it and transform her into something less than what she was, but far more than a mere revenant.&quot;What... hah...&quot; the woman lets out a deep, steaming breath.

His eyes are not filled with lust, even though all of her secrets are bared to him. Rather, a delicious fear wafts off of him, coloring his voice as he panics, &quot;You&#039;re joking. Big Sis, you&#039;re gonna turn that blade right back on that bitch, right?&quot;&quot;Huh?&quot; the Spellsword stops, the blade raised above her head and poised to strike. &quot;Why would Abby attack her mistress? She makes Abby&#039;s heart feel all warm and tingly... and the sex feels even better than that~!&quot;Those are the last words Mikhail ever hears. Abigail wears a cruel smile that mimics your own as she brings the blade crashing down upon his neck. With a elegant flourish, she hooks the blade around and cleanly lops his head off, sending it flying. Ignoring the blood gushing out and splattering her body, Abigail once again eyes the blade with a childish curiosity, her cheeks puffing out in a pout. &quot;Awww... when Abby got stabbed with this, Abby became Mistress&#039;s Little Sis. Why didn&#039;t Mikhail become Mistress&#039;s... no, Big Sis&#039;s little bro?&quot;Hearing her words, you come to a realization."

The profane gift you granted her helps to release the inhibitions of those who receive it, letting all sorts of things that people normally keep repressed bubble to the top. In the case of Lady Brightspring, the slower burn you subjected her to first knocked loose her filter, letting her be more harsh with you. The part where she learns to love her future role in the brothels will come later. For Miss Abigail, it seems that you&#039;ve unlocked an odd personality quirk that she&#039;s kept locked up tight.Though, did she really? Or is she just embracing a desired role of &#039;Little Sis&#039; that she wanted to play, but couldn&#039;t because the rest of her party was unreliable compared to her? Either way, you&#039;re not sure how you feel about this. &quot;Mistress is fine,&quot; you tell her, your tone flat as your gaze. &quot;In fact, it is preferred that you refer to me as such. You can also go back to using &#039;I&#039; now.&quot;Abigail looks back to you with a pout. Does she think that looks cute? You&#039;ve been examining her things, she&#039;s only a year younger than you. A twenty eight year old woman shouldn&#039;t make faces like that. She eventually says, &quot;Abby will call Mistress Mistress. But Abby will still call Abby Abby, because it&#039;s always been Abby&#039;s fondest wish to become the Number One Most Adorable Little Sister in the World!&quot;Silence hangs in the air as she strikes a pose she no doubt believes is cute.Robert stares at her. Stella stares at her. Bless his hate filled heart, Clint ignores his fallen &#039;Big Sis&#039; and is still trying to glare you to death.&quot;Fine.&quot; You don&#039;t feel the need to press the issue. The corps did warn you that using the Blade of the Defiler to shortcut the corruption from a Profane Gift could result in your new minions having quirks. You just didn&#039;t think this sort of thing was on the table. &quot;Just... continue. Gentle stab through the throat this time, I find that works better. And when you&#039;re done with Robert, bring the Blade here. There&#039;s something I need to do with it before you jam it into Clint...&quot;&quot;Kaaaaaaaaay~!&quot; Abigail turns from Mikhail&#039;s corpse to Robert with bright eyes and an innocent smile on her face. Quickly and efficiently, she nicks his carotid artery... and that does the trick. The corruption seeps into his body, and he rises soon enough as a revenant, the light of consciousness gone from his eyes. Abigail cheerily hugs him and spins him around, celebrating that one of her &#039;little bros&#039; gets to join her in service to their new mistress. It&#039;s strange to see how she&#039;s so cheery and animated, compared to the listless and unresponsive revenant trying to dance with her. Eventually, she remembers to bring you the sword, so that it can be prepared to raise Clint."

Taking out a steel dagger, for the Blade of the Defiler would seal the wound it makes with corruption, you open your palm and pour blood onto the tang of the blade. It hisses, and the ichor turns from pitch black to a deep shade of purple. &quot;Now you can go do Clint. Shallow cut, again, you don&#039;t want to take his head off like Mikhail&#039;s.&quot;&quot;Kaaaaaaaaay~!&quot; Her affirmation is far too cheerful and far too casual for your liking, but she&#039;s strong enough that you suppose she warrants it. Stronger than Detlev, for certain, and he&#039;s strong enough that you regret not keeping a semblance of consciousness around for him. As Abigail skips off to slit Clint&#039;s throat, you offer your bleeding palm to Stella. She looks at it in confusion, and you can&#039;t believe you have to tell her to, &quot;Heal me, Priestess.&quot;She stares at you with dead eyes. &quot;Why should I?&quot;&quot;Because I could have made you clean us up with your tongue,&quot; you tell her without missing a beat. She shudders in disgust, though her cheeks pinken in a way that makes you smirk. &quot;But, if you want a carrot... heal whoever I tell you to, whenever I tell you to from now on, and I&#039;ll let you warm Abigail&#039;s bed when I&#039;m not having her for the night. You&#039;ll be in chastity because I can smell the virgin on you, and that&#039;s too valuable to waste. Your movements will be restricted with a special collar. But sleeping in a bedroom with the woman you love is a lot better than the dungeons, right?&quot;&quot;You&#039;re a monster,&quot; she states the obvious.

The structure of Imperial Society is not as rigid as a caste system, but there is a loose social strata where below a certain threshold you don&#039;t have a say in society (or even your own life) and above a certain threshold you can do more or less whatever you want (provided it doesn&#039;t piss off one of your near-peers). There used to be a racial element to this stratification where Demons were always above Mortals, but that has eroded over the ages: equality is still a distant dream that most don&#039;t even care about, but it&#039;s what you can do rather than what you are that determines you place in society.At the top are the 666 Divider Lords, who together rule the Empire.The Plane Lords each administrate a single plane.The Realm Lords have authority over areas on a plane around the size of a galaxy (called a Realm).The Segmentum Lords have authority over a chunk of a Realm; usually there are 666 to a single Realm.The System Lords have authority over a single star system.The High Nobility are below system lords, typically having authority over an area of at least a continent, to multiple planets.The Nobility have have authority over towns, cities, or even country-sized regions.Note that there can be unlanded people at each rank below the Divider Lords (who technically don&#039;t have lands at all). They will typically have prestige and authority on par with someone controlling that large of a region. Also, these can be a bit deceiving; the High Lord who administrates the Capital of Hell is seen as a peer to the Realm Lords, for example. Dormandal is an unlanded System Lord.Prestige and authority wise, the military is divided in a similar manner, with the Generals who run the forces for each plane answering directly to the Divider Lords. As a low ranking Dreadknight, Saligia has been raised to peerage with the Nobility, making her easily part of the top 1% of the Empire in terms of &quot;shit she can get away with&quot;.Citizens have rights. They are are the upper crust of ordinary people, be they merchants, skilled laborers, academics, or even simple laborers. The Middle Class more or less. They get to vote on matters that require a vote by Hell&#039;s law. Saligia&#039;s biological dad is a Citizen."

        "text": "&gt;&gt;6266319Serfs have rights. These are the bulk of the population. The everyman, the unskilled laborer, the dudes who will take their lunch on the structural supports of the building they&#039;re working on. They do not have a say in government matters, which means that outside of things that would violate their Hell-granted rights, they&#039;re very much subject to the whims of their local lord. Citizens can become Serfs as punishment for a severe enough crime.Slaves do not have rights or protections outside what their masters would grant them. There are fewer slaves than serfs in the Empire, though not by all that much. Their population consists of captured enemies of the Empire, serfs who received severe punishment for a crime, and their descendants. There are two classes of slaves: public and private. Public slaves are slaves held by the government, and are generally seen as &quot;serfs with less rights&quot; who do undesirable jobs (such as prostitution, mining, sewer maintenance) and receive room, board, and a modicum of protection. Saligia&#039;s mother was a Public Slave of Deep Tartarus, which wasn&#039;t the worst place to be a Public Slave.Personal Slaves tend to either have things much better or far worse than Public Slaves. On the higher end of things, educated slaves will often find comfortable positions as a noble&#039;s trusted right hand, or as tutor to the children of merchants and nobles, which comes with a level of status that most slaves would not receive. Butlers and maids are also nice positions for a Personal Slave to be in, though depending on the master&#039;s proclivities they may have to engage in bedroom service (which can be a burden or a job perk depending on the person. Especially since it can lead to a maid or butler getting promoted to Courtesan). Courtesans kept by a noble are also often - but not always - slaves.On the low end of things, well, some masters tend to be sadistic bastards who make Saligia look tame. It&#039;s illegal for them to harm a serf, citizen, or public slave like that, but they can do what they want to their own property. There are also those who use slaves they purchase as materials to make soul gems, revenants, and other things that would require a living, sentient being. And, of course, there are those who use them for human experimentation, &quot;how to brainwash someone better&quot;, &quot;can a human survive X, Y, or Z?&quot;, &quot;what happens to a mortal if I...?&quot;Saligia&#039;s mother is currently a Private Slave and the favored courtesan of a kindhearted human System Lord who is good friends with Dormandal. She&#039;s doing just fine in his care, and Saligia has a sibling on the way.&gt;&gt;6266231Well of Corruption is a combat tool, while Soul Gem is post-Combat. Makes it more likely that people you cut down yourself become corrupted Revenants."

The Skeletal Maids set out a fine meal for you and Tiffany in the manor&#039;s great hall, with room and food enough for the unexpected addition of your new retainers. Abigail, Clint, and the now-collared Stella join you at the high table while Robert joins the other mindless revenants at the lower table. Clint is a dainty eater, almost excessively neat and well mannered. Abigail devours her food like a boisterous tomboy, ripping meat off the bone with her teeth. Stella stares at the food as if expecting it to be poisoned, and then at the happily eating Tiffany with deep concern.Dormandal is there as well, his maids providing him an ice cold pitcher of milk. Chocolate milk tonight. Where it disappears to is a mystery.&quot;So, young master Clint, was it?&quot; Dormandal asks the high Revenant you created with your blood. &quot;Saligia tells me that you&#039;re a spellcaster. Pray tell, what branch of magecraft do you specialize in?&quot;Clint chews his cut of turkey and then swallows, washing it down with a sip of water before speaking. His face is expressionless, his blue eyes glowing intensely against his sclera which have been dyed black. Unlike your other revenants, he possesses a mind, though like a skeleton slowly gains awareness, his personality is yet to fully form. His voice is calm, light, and taciturn when he speaks, &quot;Destruction. Specifically the actualization of wide-area exothermic phenomenon through the application of elementally aligned prana.&quot;At his explanation, Abigail throws an arm around his shoulder. &quot;Don&#039;t say it like that, Clinty~! There&#039;s way too many big words there, no one&#039;s gonna understand that.&quot;Abigail throws a bright grin at Dormandal and says. &quot;He casts fireball, Lord Dormandal. Not just the big boom type fireball, neither. He can make big snakes of fire, little precise rays of fire that burn through just about anything, and even walls of solid fire that&#039;ll trap baddies that try to get away. That&#039;s why Abby chose him as her team&#039;s blaster caster, &#039;cuz he&#039;s real good at it!&quot;Dormandal takes a sip of his milk, and when he replies, there&#039;s a tone of amusement in his voice. &quot;Thank you for the explanation, Little Sis, it was very thorough. It seems you made some fine allies of these troublemakers, Lady Saligia. Though I do wonder why you haven&#039;t turned Sister Stella here into a high revenant as well. She looks like she&#039;s chafing under the slave collar... surely a happy healer is a more effective healer, no?&quot;&quot;She&#039;s not simply a priestess, Dormandal,&quot; you tell him. &quot;She&#039;s a maiden priestess.&quot;&quot;Ah, say no more,&quot; Dormandal nods when he hears that she&#039;s a virgin. &quot;That would be far too useful for certain rituals, yes.

Excuse me, but I shall retire for the evening.&quot;With those words, she leaves the table and goes upstairs, to the room she shares with Abigail.You sigh. &quot;I came on too strongly there, didn&#039;t I?&quot;Dormandal nods. &quot;When society tells someone to protect their virginity against temptation, they usually do not respond well to topics of that nature. Why, there was one world I once visited - Empire sworn, no less! - where the men and women were so obsessed with their purity that they only ever did the act through holes in the bedsheet, never once looking upon the form of their lover.&quot;&quot;That&#039;s weird,&quot; Tiffany says through a mouthful of potatoes. Swallowing them, she gives you a reassuring clap on the shoulder. &quot;And Stella doesn&#039;t know what she&#039;s missing out on.&quot;&quot;Yeah, Mistress is pretty good at with her lance,&quot; Abigail nods vigorously. A sly smile spreads across her face as she leans over to Clint and wraps an arm around his shoulder. Her voice is sweet and playful as she says, &quot;Hey~! You know what Abby just thought of? Clint&#039;s a real cutie pie, and it&#039;s not like there&#039;s a rule against guys enjoying a joooooust~ What do you think, Clint? Do you think you&#039;d have fun if Mistress showed you how she uses her lance~?&quot;She looks at you with big, puppy-dog eyes, &quot;Provided Mistress isn&#039;t opposed to showing him?&quot;&quot;Well, if you&#039;re deciding on bedwarmers for the evening, I think I shall take my leave,&quot; Dormandal says, rising from the table. Amusement runs thick in his voice. &quot;Good work today, Saligia. The temple is no longer a blight on the town, and you captured or killed an entire team of adventurers without losing a single skeleton. A splendidly executed ambush, even if the setup was a bit... avante garde.&quot;"

        "text": "You have an absolutely wonderful evening with Tiff and Clint. Where Tiff is eager and exuberant, Clint is slow to warm up and ever so taciturn even when he gets hot and bothered. Both of them spoil you absolutely rotten until the night&#039;s activities wear the three of you down. Tiff has to take the lead, showing the inexperienced young man what to do and how to do it, holding his hand through every new experience. To you, though, the most delicious part comes from seeing the face of a man who glared at you with such hatred not a handful of hours ago flush with pleasure as you make him your woman.&quot;It&#039;s a good thing we didn&#039;t make a sandwich of him last night,&quot; you say once morning comes.Tiff appears to have turned Clint into her doll. The young man doesn&#039;t seem to mind, sitting infront of a mirror with little expression beyond a slight happy curve to his lips and a bit of color in his cheeks as Tiff brushes his hair. Both are nude, and both make for a wonderful sight in the morning. Tiff turns her eyes to you, but doesn&#039;t stop dolling up the young man. &quot;I mean, I swore my loyalty to you. Letting someone else in down there feels like it would be breaking that, and I&#039;m no oathbreaker. Besides which, compared to you, he&#039;s a little... small...&quot;Is that a pout you see on Clint&#039;s face? If it is, it&#039;s the smallest ghost of a pout. Still, he&#039;s your mage now, so you feel the need to defend his honor. &quot;He has nothing to be ashamed of there. Comparing his to mine is unfair, for he grew his himself while my lance is a gift from the Ravager whose sole purpose is to inflict humiliation, despair, and a hell of pleasure upon the enemies of the Empire.&quot;As you take a seat behind Tiff and start brushing her hair, she says, &quot;Well in my opinion it&#039;s more like heaven~&quot;&quot;You&#039;re not an enemy of the Empire, my dear Tiffany~&quot; you remind her. True, the difference between a &#039;hell of pleasure&#039; and a &#039;heaven of pleasure&#039; is how much the person wants to experience it, but that&#039;s neither here nor there. &quot;Neither is dear Clint, not anymore. He&#039;s a loyal servant, and an asset to the Empire now. So is his virginity, so we need to make sure we protect it throughout our nightly activities.&quot;Clint&#039;s head cocks to one side in confusion. His voice is flat and monotone as he says, &quot;But I gave Mistress Saligia my virginity last night. It was nice.&quot;&quot;Yeah, I think that ship sailed,&quot; Tiff says with a chuckle. &quot;You really got into it with him, Sally. I almost got jealous~&quot;&quot;Well, I certainly made him my woman,&quot; you say, and both of them nod in agreement. &quot;But what we got up to doesn&#039;t count for guys. Well, maybe it counts in some ways that matter, but for the purpose of magic rituals and powers? Our dear Clint hasn&#039;t put his magical staff to use on any maidens just yet... and if I have my way, he won&#039;t be using it on anyone until he&#039;s thirty at the very least.&quot;Another small pout crosses Clint&#039;s face. &quot;But that&#039;s six years from now, Mistress Saligia...&quot;"

        "text": "&gt;&gt;6267101You face twists into an eye-to-eye smile filled with joy and lust in equal measure, the sort of smile that most men would be thrilled to see upon their lover. Well, if it didn&#039;t come with a spicy dash of sadism behind it. Not the usual, malicious sadism you wear when cutting down your foes, but the sadism of a woman who loves seeing her man squirm before she takes care of him gently. &quot;I know, and it will be really hard to hold out on your own. Luckily, we have special tools that will help you avoid temptation~&quot;Clint&#039;s face remains expressionless as he tilts his head and asks, &quot;What do you mean by &#039;tools&#039;?&quot;Your attempts to tame the wild tangle of Tiff&#039;s hair proving futile, you reach into your things and withdraw a small metallic device whose purpose isn&#039;t immediately clear. Both Clint and Tiff give it a curious look as you step around them with the device in hand. When you kneel down and put it on Clint, you can see something awaken in Tiff&#039;s eyes, while Clint still seems confused. &quot;This will make sure that you&#039;re a good boy for the next six years~&quot;&quot;Oh, that makes sense.&quot; The calm and taciturn voice in which he accepts the device - something you, and most men, would complain about - is adorable. &quot;What will happen once I&#039;m thirty?&quot;&quot;Yeah, I&#039;m kind of confused about that, too...&quot; Tiff admits. Her eyes are still locked on the device, her face flushed as red as the fringes of her blonde hair as her imagination runs wild. &quot;I know that taking someone&#039;s virginity can be a powerful magical catalyst, that&#039;s kinda why I threw mine away when I was younger. Didn&#039;t want to be the virgin who gets kidnapped for an evil wizard&#039;s profane ritual, you know?&quot;You stare at her blankly. Clint joins you, though his look is of innocent confusion as he asks, &quot;But aren&#039;t you the lover of an evil knight who has received her profane gift?&quot;&quot;This and that are two entirely different things,&quot; she replies, making a big X with her arms. &quot;The point is... if you have a ritual in mind, why wait until he&#039;s thirty? And if there&#039;s no ritual you want to use his virginity for, then what&#039;s the point of putting that thing on him? I mean, it&#039;s kinda hot and all, but...&quot;&quot;I guess it&#039;s not that well known outside the Empire...&quot; you say with a shake of your head. Putting on your teaching voice, you explain one of the many obscura that Dormandal taught you in your youth. &quot;It began as an urban legend on the Cradle, thousands of years before the Dies Irae. &#039;If a man reaches thirty years old without losing his virginity, he becomes a wizard.&#039; After the Dies Irae, when magic began to flow through the Material Planes more freely, that urban legend became real. In fact, the very first mortal spellcasters were men who did not know the touch of a woman until their mid thirties and forties, if they knew a woman&#039;s touch at all.&quot;&quot;In the modern day, a male mage who remains untouched down there until they&#039;re 30 will see an immense swell of power!&quot; you finish."

Tiff is the one brave enough to speak first and say: &quot;That sounds made up, Sally.&quot;&quot;It&#039;s not,&quot; you say with absolute certainty. Dormandal himself used such tools to maintain his discipline for the first thirty years of his life, so that his arcane might would swell tremendously. Well, he never spoke of using such tools, but he did speak of not having any luck with women until his 30s, which is patently impossible. You never knew him before he shed his flesh, but you&#039;re quite certain that any woman who did not throw herself at your father figure while he still walked amongst the living was a tasteless shrew who did not understand how great a man he was. You can read between the lines. &quot;I don&#039;t know the exact mechanism, but I assume the buildup of orgone within the arcanovascular system-&quot;&quot;Mistress Saligia, it&#039;s fine,&quot; Clint says. His expression is blank save for a small upcurve on his lips, and an odd light in his eye that almost seems pitying. He places a hand upon your shoulder and says. &quot;If this sort of thing makes you happy, then I&#039;m happy as well. You don&#039;t need to make up a reason for it.&quot;But you&#039;re not...! you almost say, but the pitying looks on their faces are too much.Is this... embassment that you&#039;re feeling!? Whatever it is, you don&#039;t like it[/i[, and yet you can&#039;t find it in yourself to speak up and reprimand them for making you feel it, either.=================After that moment passes, you all get dressed for the morning. Tiff throws on her usual working shirt and overalls far faster than you can don your harness. She doesn&#039;t bother with any makeup for herself, and her hair looks neater than usual thanks to your effort, but it&#039;s not as meticulously groomed as your perfectly straight blonde hair by any means. In fact, it&#039;s still rather messy.You manifest the Tainted Bulwark in its usual form, a skintight black bodysuit of woven tendrils that pulse with life, white veins running through the living relic&#039;s arcanovascular system just as black veins run through your own. It supports your bosom and protects your crotch well enough that you do not bother putting undergarments over it. Over the second skin, you don a white steelsilk tunic trimmed with red, and a set of durable black britches of the same material. Your harness goes over those, maille first and then the plate.While you get into your harness, Tiff plays dress up doll with Clint. She found some clothes that once belonged to Lady Brightspring and has dressed the young man up with him."

        "text": "&gt;&gt;6267103The gown she puts him in has a shoulderless blouse of gold silk that drapes down over the curve of his hips and hangs down at his knees in the back. In the front, the cloth rises up all the way to the tie-off at his waist. Sewn onto the breast among the frills that circle his torso beneath the shoulders is a great blue rose of cloth that would have hidden any cleavage that would have shown had he a nice pair of tits. The blue of the rose matches his eyes, and the long flowing skirt worn beneath the blouse.&quot;I look cute,&quot; he deadpans upon seeing his reflection in the mirror. He tilts his head towards Tiff and asks, &quot;Are men supposed to look cute?&quot;&quot;Yes,&quot; Tiffany declares, a look of excitement on her face. &quot;Even if the village boys complained about it when I braided their hair and dressed them up, this is peak male performance! Even burly men should dress cutely like this. If they did, the world would be at peace!&quot;&quot;Hmmm, I don&#039;t know about that,&quot; you say. Some of your previously flings were pretty burly guys, and you don&#039;t think it would have been as fun if they were dolled up the way Tiff dolled up Clint here. Yeah, if you want to get pinned down and taken by someone, you&#039;d prefer that fellow be big and muscular. That said, the dress definitely suits Clint. &quot;Cute men and burly men both have their place in the world, and you shouldn&#039;t try to force a burly man to be cute any more than you should try to force a cute man to be burly. That said, you&#039;re definitely cute, Clint. I like it.&quot;&quot;Well if Mistress Saligia says so, then it must be a good thing,&quot; Clint says, his voice still monotone and without emotion. &quot;What&#039;s the plan for today?&quot;&quot;Tiff will be working with Dormandal to complete the wards on the town,&quot; you say. Tiff nods; based on the reports, the two of them are a little less than halfway through warding the town against invaders. &quot;As for myself, I&#039;ll be taking some forces with me to go remind the farmsteads in these parts that their allegiance is owed to the Empire.

While he specializes in destructive magics, he can at least act as a convenient mana battery while learning what he can from them. He should be capable of that much, as a High Revenant possessing sapience.Abigail stays behind as well. Her boisterous and easygoing attitude is not the face that you want to present to the peasantry. With her ferocity and playfulness, she&#039;s best left behind to assist the skeletons with their forest patrols and keeping an eye on Stella when she wants to go out and about. You&#039;ve permitted Stella to visit the Temple as she pleases, as long as she has Abigail escorting her. The collar about her neck will punish her if she tries to push what you&#039;ve allowed her too far. Nominally, this is to allow her the opportunity to pray, but you doubt she&#039;ll get much prayer in with Abigail around.After all, with her inhibitions unshackled by your Profane Gift, Abigail has been quite forward with Stella.In public, Abigail openly gropes Stella like a mobster might keep his hands on one of his kept women. You can only imagine what the two of them will get up to in the privacy of temple. Well, whatever it is, it won&#039;t go too far thanks to the chastity belt that you&#039;ve used to lock away Abigail&#039;s maidenhood. If only you had one of the models that stimulated the wearer that your friend Varten sells. That would have made an entertaining spectacle of the priestess.&quot;Alas, that will have to do,&quot; you mutter to yourself. Abigail escorting Stella should be stimulation enough, the priestess already wears a delightful expression whenever her lover&#039;s hands get too brazen. Calling your pale horse into existence from the Dream Realm, you mount up. &quot;Alright, men, we&#039;re moving out. Keep an eye open on the road. Lord Kettleburn has hired mercenaries in the hopes of catching us off guard, let&#039;s be sure to turn them into precious materials for Lord Dormandal if they try!&quot;Your troops move down the road in a wedge formation.The revenants lead the formation with the heavily armored Detlev as the tip of the spear, his maul resting upon his shoulders for the march. Three revenants follow him on each side, and then behind them are the two squads of skeletons you chose to bring with you. The formation fills the road, and you ride a the center upon your pale horse. A bone squire recently raised by Dormandal follows behind you, acting as your standard bearer. The long pennant of the Dreadknights flutters in the wind, your personal banner hanging beneath it and announcing your presence to all the world. For a task such as this, you do not need to move in stealth. Announcing your presence to the peasantry and demanding fealty is the whole purpose, after all."

        "text": "&gt;&gt;6267607Most are happy to kneel when you pass through the little thorpes that dot the land surrounding Brightsprings.These people are the salt of the earth, after all. Simple folk, men and women raised to fear and respect the masters of Hell and the mighty retainers who have received their blessings and act with their authority. Citizens of the Empire without a rebellious thought in their soul, who held the soft townsfolk who chose to raise their swords against their rightful rulers in disdain. How much of that was genuine, and how much of that was born of a fear that you would do unto them what was done to the town, it doesn&#039;t matter.You have their obedience. In some cases, you have their adoration. You shake hands with the village elders, you pat the heads of children, you prove to them that where the Dreadknights can bring a gauntleted fist down to crush the enemies of the Empire, they can also grant a velvet touch to their friends. Charm is not something that comes naturally to you, but you&#039;re a comely enough woman that it doesn&#039;t need to. Even when your cruelty slips out, it gets brushed beneath your beauty.Plus, well, you want to set a good example for the children, so you keep on your best behavior. You do not need veiled threats to old men who are happy to acknowledge your authority. You can restrain your language from being too vulgar. Refusing the advances of comely young men and women eager to show a beautiful lady knight their village&#039;s hospitality takes all of your restraint, but you endure it.On your first day alone you receive nearly a dozen crowns of woven flowers. A hundred requests for tales of your adventures from rapscallions who dream of running of to join the Squire Corps. One such tale you weave from a high table, where the chief of the Goldgrain Hamlet - a blacksmith by the name of Roger - feted you in celebration of your defeat of &#039;those damned foreign heretics&#039; at Brightsprings. He laid your praises on a bit thick, but the sign of the Industrialist hangs high over his hearth, and the shrine at the center of his hamlet carries none of that rotten stench of divinity. Your arrival became an excuse for celebration, wine and ale flowing freely and food piling up high.&quot;-and so we finally reached the heart of the cult&#039;s lair,&quot; you tell the crowd one of the nicer tales of your days as a Squire. &quot;A shrine tangled amidst the roots of a great date-palm tree, long dead to the ravages of the Black Goat&#039;s Blight. Its sap oozed out from the roots in the sickly blackened emerald that is the color of oblivion. Before the shrine stood the mastermind behind it all, a heretical sorceress whose beliefs and praxis made even the slaves of the Pretenders seem innocent in the eyes of the Divider Lords.&quot;&quot;What could be worse than worshipping the Pretenders to G-d&#039;s throne?&quot; one of the adults asks, confused and treading lightly about the topic of heresies worse than heresies."

        "text": "&gt;&gt;6267608&quot;The blighted, the leaf-eaters, and those who would burn the world&#039;s branches to ash,&quot; you tell them. The crowd becomes hushed, knowing not of the horrors that you speak of. &quot;The Divider Lords wish to keep the Throne empty, reserved for the one true G-d who has yet to appear in our world. The Pretenders seek to usurp it, to name themselves Lord over a creation they had no hand in making. This cult worshipped beasts that never were, who seek nothing but oblivion and death.&quot;&quot;And did you get the Bad Guys, Lady Clearwater?&quot; a child asks.&quot;We did. We punished them in the name of the Divider Lords,&quot; you assure the child and ruffle his hair. &quot;Though before we could, we had to face a great foe, for we were too late to save all of their captives. The mastermind, in mad desperation, made a sacrifice of a young maiden to call forth one of the Black Goat&#039;s thousand young into the world. It possessed the rotting tree from the inside, a hundred slavering maws opening from its bark as the dead branches became sickly, emerald-black tendrils.&quot;You happily puff out your chest with pride. &quot;I cut six of those tendrils down with my own blade, defending our spellcasters as they chanted a spell of banishment. A great feat for a young squire facing down a beast of oblivion, I&#039;ll have you know. It was my teacher, Sir Arthur Morningstar, who finally brought the beast low and allowed our mages to send it back from the nothingness whence it came. He fought with all the ferocity of the Ravager Himself, and with a mighty blow from his reliquary blade - the Moonlit Darksword - he cleaved the beast near in two!&quot;You spare them the details of what came after. Sir Arthur spared the heretical sorceress no indignity, and marched her naked and in chains back to the heart of Dis to await an execution that never came. Apparently the wife of some System Lord took a fancy to the sorceress&#039;s body, so her soul was extracted and her arcanovascular system purified of Oblivion&#039;s taint, allowing the woman to place her own soul within it.If you remember it correctly, the soulstone should have been allocated to one of the anima reactor plants in Dis. She was a powerful enough sorceress that it should still be helping to keep the lights on over there.Roger Smith happily lends you a room for the night, which you share with Detlev and your bone squire. The rest of your forces camp just outside the hamlet, though without fortifications dug in and only a few small tents assembled you can hardly call it a camp. Still, they didn&#039;t need the fortification, the night passes without incident and you&#039;re on your way again in the morning.It&#039;s a few miles out from the Goldgrain Hamlet that you encounter trouble."

        "text": "&gt;&gt;6267609A man in light armor naps beneath a tree, the brim of his hat tilted to keep the sun out of his eyes. His black hair is cropped short and neat, and the stubble of a beard runs along his chin. A longsword rests against his shoulder, its scabbard worn but its pommel gleaming with care, the scent of magic wafting off it like a spiced apple pie. While he does not pass beneath your notice, you do not pay him all that much mind until he speaks.&quot;Ah, Miss Dreadknight, I should warn you...&quot; he drawls, not standing up from his relaxed position. &quot;Hum, how should I put it... not many people get to choose the place they die, but if you keep going down that road as you are, you&#039;ll be making that choice? Yeah, that seems like the right thing to say...&quot;&quot;Is that a threat?&quot; your voice is ice cold at the man&#039;s words.&quot;No? No... yeah, no, I don&#039;t threaten pretty ladies,&quot; he thinks aloud for a moment before deciding that no, it&#039;s apparently not meant to be a threat. You still do not release your hand from its grip upon the Blade of the Defiler. &quot;Especially ones that can kick my ass. Just thought you could use the warning. See, this boring guy put a bounty of 100,000 denarii on your head, and now a bunch of lowlifes have taken over the next hamlet down the road to catch you in an ambush.&quot;Your eyes narrow as you appraise the man. He seems awfully relaxed for someone talking to a Dreadknight with a retinue as large as yours, which means that he&#039;s probably pretty strong. &quot;And you know this, how?&quot;&quot;Cuz I was interested enough in fighting a strong opponent that I decided to hear the boring guy out,&quot; he admits to talking with a man you suspect to be Lord Kettleburn without breaking a beat. &quot;The way those lowlifes he called in are going about it didn&#039;t sit right with me, though. Taking hostages, locking a bunch of people in a warehouse, putting crossbowmen in the windows of every house is a way to fight a stronger opponent I guess, but that sort of thing is what makes them a bunch of lowlifes. Mama didn&#039;t raise me to fight dirty like that.&quot;&quot;Oh?&quot; you stare at the swordsman for a moment. That would be how you defended a town without walls, to be sure, though the people would be in the most easily fortified building rather than locked in a warehouse. &quot;And how would you go about trying to kill me, if you wanted to claim that 100,000 denarii bounty from Lord Kettleburn?&quot;&quot;Oh, you know the boring fellow&#039;s name, that great. Means I don&#039;t have to tell you,&quot; The man finally rises, stretching himself out. Turning to you, a bloodlust shines in his eyes and his sword rattles in its scabbard. &quot;If I wanted to kill you, I&#039;d approach you on the road and ask you to fight one on one. None of those skeletons, corrupted fellows, or any of those lowlifes taking part, just you and me.&quot;You look at him and say, &quot;You know I can&#039;t accept such an offer. I&#039;m here on business, you see, and so if I find any heretics I need to kill, I&#039;m obliged to use every tool available.&quot;"

        "text": "As the man named Quinn takes his leave, you flip a coin. Not just any coin, but the one you found amidst the village you&#039;ve taken that can answer a simple question each day. When it lands on heads, you nod to yourself. &quot;Alright lads, this isn&#039;t a trap,&quot; you inform your force of skeletons. &quot;Looks like the enemy is waiting for us in the next village. Would have been nice for Mr. Quinn to let us know how many adventurers Kettleburn hired, but expect them to be more seasoned than the militia. I wouldn&#039;t expect these to be as strong as Abigail and her party, give how they&#039;ve holed up, but we can&#039;t be careful. Here&#039;s how we&#039;re going to do it...&quot;You dismount your pale horse and take out a map of the region. Folding it appropriately, you show them the Hamlet you&#039;re about to raid.Twenty houses neatly pressed against the road, surrounded by a fence to keep the animals out. Annoying for a determined invasion force, but certainly no curtain wall that your skeletons would need to climb over. The warehouse sits near the edge of the village, slightly away from the houses on its row. Auspiciously, it&#039;s the closest structure to your approach, giving you easy access once you&#039;ve baited the ambush.&quot;Detlev, we&#039;re gonna pretend that you&#039;re me,&quot; you tell him. The near-mindless revenant cocks his head, as if to say - how am I supposed to do that when I&#039;ve hardly got a brain? - but you put a reassuring hand on his shoulder. &quot;All you need to do is ride out there with the other revenants, and hold this blade aloft. My little bird friend will bait them out.&quot;To that end, you use a certain art of reliquary invocation: the ability to bestow relics on your allies. A pale horse appears now for Detlev, and though his cannot stride across the waters and snow as yours can, it is a steady worthy of a dreadknight. In his hands, a lesser version of your Blade of the Defiler. While it cannot cause a wound that festers with corruption, as you had done with Abigail, those slain by it will still rise again as your loyal minions.And lastly, a raven leaps from your signet ring and lands on Detlev&#039;s shoulder. &quot;I can speak for you through this,&quot; you say through the raven. Its beak opens as though to caw, and your voice comes out of it. Deeper than it should have been, sounding with the same distortions of a demon&#039;s voice when possessing one of their loyal servants. &quot;In the dark of night, they will only see a man clad in steel, raising a blade aloft and demanding their submission. They will not see the bird upon your should speaking.&quot;Turning to the skeletons, you speak normally. &quot;As for the 2nd and 3rd squadrons... while Detlev centers all of their attention on himself and the Revenants, your task will be to encircle the hamlet. Take out any patrolling guards, and provide counterfire against the crossbowmen that are set up in the windows.&quot;"

        "text": "&gt;&gt;6270213Taking one last look at the map, you frown. There&#039;s no church, so there ought not be any truly powerful priests here, but... even a pathetic priestess like Stella who kisses clams with another woman as a way around her vows of chastity can be dangerous to the undead. &quot;Lastly, beware any holy magics that get flung around. Don&#039;t run immediately if you see it, but if a spell gets cast of the third tier, retreat immediately.&quot;A rattle of affirmation answers you. You then look to the revenants, &quot;That goes for you as well, Detlev. Pull back if a third tier spell gets cast. We want to avoid casualties.&quot;&quot;Yes... m&#039;Lady...&quot;Your eyes widen slightly when Detlev doesn&#039;t give a wordless grunt in response, but instead the weak will words that sound more of a man under mind control than a mindless revenant. He does not sound like he has Clint&#039;s full sapience, but for his personality to already begin shaping... you have a few hypotheses. A strong will in life speeds up the process, and so too does allowing them to fill their desires from life.Your lips curl into a smile. He really wanted to fuck Lady Brightspring, didn&#039;t he? If her existence and blood connection to the land wasn&#039;t a threat to holding it, you&#039;d almost be tempted to let him keep her as a pet. Instead, you simply pat him on the shoulder and say, &quot;Good boy.&quot;============Dusk arrives soon enough.The skeletons of the 4th Company have already disappeared into the fields of grain, their longbows at the ready and awaiting the order to strike. Detlev mounts his pale horse, your raven upon his shoulder and the bestowed Blade of the Defiler at his side. You move carefully through the grain yourself, but where the skeletons continue on down the length of the hamlet, you stop near the warehouse to wait for the single to move.A shrieking whinny, the terrifying sound of a Pale Horse&#039;s battle cry sounds out. The signal for you to throw your voice through the Raven and shout, &quot;Men of Briarthorpe, your redemption is at hand! Come out, and throw down thy arms! Bend the knee whilst the opportunity remains, and thy apostasy can yet be forgiven! Refuse, and all thou shalt know is the forgiveness of the grave!&quot;A woman&#039;s voice answers from one of the houses. &quot;Ride back to your pit, Dreadknight! Ain&#039;t no one left in this village with any loyalty to your empire, &#039;cept for you. Won&#039;t even be that left if you insist on sticking around.&quot;&quot;So,&quot; your voice booms, distorted and deepened through the raven&#039;s maw. Like a greater demon possessing a host. &quot;You have chosen the grave.&quot;Arrows loose with the precision only the undead can bring, launching through the windows and striking the crossbowmen dead center of mass. Yet for each one slain, another quickly takes its place, crossbow at the ready and bolts ready to loose. Chaos is sewn amongst their ranks, but not as much as you would like. As the bolts fly at the revenants and Detlev, you pull your perception back from the Raven and begin your own work."

For all that your armor&#039;s joints do not creak, that the maille does not jingle in the night against the steel, your footfalls cannot be anything but heavy and your motions are far from nimble. You move with grace, but it is the grace of a masterfully wielded battleaxe and not the fine precision of the rapier.&quot;You hear that?&quot; a man set to guard the warehouse calls out, moments after you slipped through the window.&quot;Hear what?&quot; another guard asks. &quot;The fighting that&#039;s going on outside? Yeah, I can hear that alright. Honestly, I&#039;m amazed it&#039;s still going - it was what, five guys? Those adventurers brought what, thirty crossbowmen with them, right? How the hell are five guys still fighting against that many?&quot;&quot;Quiet you,&quot; the first guard says. &quot;I heard something inside, you ninny.&quot;&quot;That&#039;s probably Erin...&quot; the second guard says. He sounds rather disgusted by something. &quot;Seriously, I&#039;m all for praising the Lord of Light and all, but those adventurers Lord Kettleburn sent are giving me some second thoughts, you know? Don&#039;t see Roger from Goldgrain and his merry bunch of fanatics running around raping and torturing his neighbors, now, do you?&quot;&quot;The adventurers are a blunt instrument that we faithful must unfortunately make use of,&quot; the first guard replies after a moment of silence. &quot;They will face the same judgment in Heaven for what they did to Erin that the Dreadknight will face for what was done to Lady Brightspring.&quot;&quot;Yeah...&quot; the second guard doesn&#039;t sound too convinced. &quot;But I mean, Lady Brightspring made the decision to rise up against the Empire and bring the Light to these lands. Miss Erin&#039;s barely a woman grown, standing by her parents like any good daughter would. It doesn&#039;t sit right with me, what those adventurer types did to her.&quot;The first guard lets out a hollow chuckle. &quot;Maybe we&#039;ll get lucky and the Dreadknight will kill all of the adventurers before succumbing to his wounds.&quot;&quot;You mean &#039;she&#039;,&quot; the second guard says, looking at his friend. &quot;I heard the Dreadknight was a pretty lady through the grapevine. That Quinn fellow who left when the others... stopped behavin&#039; as Light fearing folk ought to said so.&quot;&quot;He must have had bad intel,&quot; the first guard replies, &quot;You saw the procession, the Dreadknight leading them was a man. Didn&#039;t you hear his voice? Ain&#039;t no lady in the world with a voice like that.&quot;&quot;If you say so...&quot; the second guard says. He perks up again as you creep close to a door, behind which you hear some muffled sounds of struggle. &quot;Wait, I think I heard something too. Let&#039;s go check it out...&quot;"

They&#039;re both burly enough, and have a rugged handsomeness to them that stirs your womanly heart in ways that Clint and Tiffany never could. They&#039;d both make delightful pets, shaggy hounds compared to the lithe cats you&#039;ve collected. &quot;Don&#039;t bark too loudly now. I do not relish the thought of killing imperial citizens, even wayward ones led into the arms of a rebellion.&quot;A lie. Death to the traitor, the heretic, and the apostate. Keeping these men alive - and more importantly, quiet - is simply more convenient to your aims at the moment. Hands left idle by your foes, who&#039;ve begun to doubt the cause they threw their lot in with, are a splendid gift to the Demon Lords&#039; workshop. So you simply keep your sword raised and dripping with the Defiler&#039;s Corruption, the meaning in your gesture clear.&quot;Tell that to the butchered children of Brightsprings,&quot; the first guard spits. But he doesn&#039;t raise his voice, not above the din of the fighting. &quot;I&#039;ve heard tell of what became of them. The Empire&#039;s dogs piled the corpses high for their masters-&quot;&quot;And not a single child among them, I promise you that.&quot; You do not deny the butchery of traitors, but such uncouth rumors are unbecoming. &quot;Those children carry the Empire&#039;s future on their backs, and the magistrates will ensure that they learn well enough to not repeat the mistakes of their parents.&quot;Silence hangs in the air for a moment. The first guard looks furious enough to leap at you, but wary eyes watch your sword, knowing that if he tried make a sound he would die faster that his breath could escape him. The second guard has a strained expression on his face, but is the first to break the silence. &quot;Look, what are you here for? It&#039;s obvious you could have ended us before we even saw you, but you didn&#039;t. So there&#039;s gotta be something you want from us, right?&quot;You do not lower your sword, but your lips crinkle into a smile. &quot;I see two stouthearted men who want to do the right thing. I know there to be near on two dozen leal citizens of the Empire in that basement. Surely staring into the light of the liar has not blinded you so much, has it?&quot;The first guard growls, &quot;Those are prisoners held against Imperial aggression, you can&#039;t possibly expect us to just let them go.&quot;&quot;I suppose not,&quot; you acquiesce, nodding your head. Then a cruelness fills your eyes. &quot;Lord Kettleburn&#039;s men need their comforts after all. Tell me, is Miss Erin a rare beauty? I imagine she is... and I imagine that those adventurers, fighting for justice, will enjoy passing her around like a common pit-whore until all the spirit dies in her eyes, either accepting her fate or taking her own life to escape it. But, I mean, I guess that&#039;s what the Lord of Light says such a deplorable heretic deserves, isn&#039;t it?&quot;"

His words give pause to his younger compatriot, who looks at him with a shock that slowly turns to rage. The older man either doesn&#039;t see it, or does not care. &quot;I&#039;ve seen the debauchery of the pit-born, the lives wasted and burned in degeneracy and anguish to keep the gears of your Empire turning. The hellish lighting, the cramped conditions, the demonic daily rituals that make wastrels of men and whores of women. In the face of such distilled depravity, any alternative is preferable.&quot;If he truly believed that, he would shout. He would raise the alarm and call for the adventurers to help kill you, and they may even succeed at wounding you. He still fears death more than depravity... but you have little hope to turn him, when he shows such conviction.

But they, at least, may earn some measure of forgiveness, for they march for His righteous cau-&quot;A cracking sound fills night.Your smile widens.The younger guard stands over the crumpled form of the older man, breathing heavily, his eyes wide and his face twisted with rage. He glares at you for a moment, his body tensing as if expecting you to do something. When all you do is give him a motherly smile, his body relaxes. Right up until you take a gamble and throw your sword at his feet. He stares at you for a moment, and then the blade... before picking it up and driving it through the man&#039;s throat.&quot;That must have been a hard decision to make,&quot; you tell him. He nods, slowly, his eyes never leaving the sword. &quot;Was he a friend?&quot;&quot;Thought he was,&quot; the young man say. He spits on the corpse, his hatred mingling with the blade&#039;s oozing corruption. &quot;No friend of mine would ever make excuses for men what raped one of our neighbors. That&#039;s the sort of shite I&#039;d expect from a monster like you. The Light&#039;s supposed to be better than this, holding themselves to a higher standard than you&#039;d expect from common brigands or Dreadknights.&quot;He contemplates the blade in his hand, before pointing it at you. A meaningless gesture, for the relic is yours and you can return it to your hand with ease, but he does not know that. &quot;Speakin&#039; of, you sure that was wise, giving me a blade this fine? I&#039;m no great fencer, but how do you know I won&#039;t return it to you through your throat?&quot;"

Unless you think they&#039;ve come to enjoy the depredations they&#039;ve been subject to?&quot;Still red in the ears, he does ask, &quot;Why do you care?&quot;"

The men are bruised and beaten, the women&#039;s clothes have been torn to leave their bosom&#039;s bare to the world. Their flesh seared with hot irons as if to mark them indelibly with the sign that they alone remained faithful to the Divider Lords. Some on their brow, some on their breast, and some on their bottom - no doubt administered as the adventurers took their fun. The children at least have only been bound, small mercy as that was.The state of their parents and their elder siblings already fills your heart with a seething hatred for all who turned against the Empire in this village. Anything more, and your hatred would overflow. You would march out in a blind fury with your sword in hand, creating such a glorious distraction for Ragnar to lead these folks away. The young man would have all the time in the world to escape, and the bodies of the Empire&#039;s enemies would pile high.You are able to keep your rage bound until the men and women are untied, and you are able to see Ragnar off with them in tow. A raven goes with them, both to keep an eye on the young man and to speak with the goodman Roger Smith once they&#039;ve arrived at his hamlet. Once they are gone, you turn to the corpse of the first guard, Martin. Your voice is a steely command, &quot;Rise.&quot;You expect the corpse to rise, the black ichor of corruption flowing through the veins of its arcanovascular system. What you do not expect was for the eyes of this revenant to open up with such clarity behind them. Nor do you expect its words once it is fully upon its feet. &quot;At your side, my lady.&quot;"

        "text": "How incredibly curious! To think that a peasant militia would possess a man with a will strong enough to echo on even after your blade forced the tainted essence of the Defiler into his arcanovascular system. You smell not a wiff of righteous hypocrisy wafting off of his wiry, well muscled body, so he did not survive in truth. What stands before you is a reflection of his soul in a mirror, had his morality reflected your own.Not quite as autonomous as those who turn upon receipt of your profane gift, but far moreso than the average revenant. As if you had created Clint purely on happenstance, rather than through deliberate measure.Which is why you must ask him a certain question with your sword held at the ready. &quot;Who do you serve?&quot;&quot;Superbia. Avaritia. Luxuria. Invidia. Gula. Ira. Acedia,&quot; he intones the sins that spell your name with a hollow reverence. His blue eyes flicker like candles against the pitch black of his sclera. &quot;These words were revealed to me as your essence rode roughshod over the soul that once inhabited this corpse, my lady. The sins and compromise of his contradictory existence drowned in the depths of your boundless, unshakable purity, and in death we are enlightened.&quot;With those words, he drops to one knee before you. In his hands there appears a blade that could have been forged from the summer sky, woven of daydreams and the careless thoughts of mortal men who cannot help but sin. He thrusts it into the ground, hands clasped about the hilt as if in prayer.&quot;He thought the life of a sword to be a sinful thing, so he sought to bend it to a plowshare,&quot; the high-revenant says. &quot;And when he found his efforts made for a mediocre tool, he left it to rust. Eyes clouded by the fog called ennui, the fool mistook peace for virtue. He allowed the mundanity of everyday life to hollow out his heart, praying that his true nature would wither like the desert peach in winter.&quot;You look down on him with red eyes blazing with hellish light. That doesn&#039;t answer your question.&quot;No more. In death, the fool has received life anew. Thy effervescent purity hath sharpened an edge upon this rusted blade,&quot; he continues his soliloquy. You have absolutely no idea what the man is on about, but you try not to let it show on your face. &quot;You, who see the world with eyes unclouded by doubt: this worthless blade is yours to wield as you see fit. Let the only rust upon it be the blood of thy enemies.&quot;Silence hangs in the air for a brief moment. Then it hits you, &quot;You&#039;re the sword, aren&#039;t you?&quot;&quot;Indeed I am, my lady,&quot; Martin replies. Is that amusement in his voice? The voice of a newborn revenant? You&#039;re not sure how you feel about that. &quot;I, Martin Aurelion, am your blade, to wield as you see fit, against whomever you see fit.&quot;"

One of your pillow friends back in the Squire Corps liked to gush about how gentlemen in their forties were the best!, when chatting about your preferences in men. You personally preferred virgin hunting - men who never had a woman before were always so deliciously eager - but you now have a convenient way to experiment with that.Later.&quot;Very well, Martin,&quot; you accept his oath. Giving him your hand, you help him to his feet. A vicious smile meets his mirthless expression, and you give him his first task. &quot;Now heed my words carefully. The first target your blade shall be turned against... is me.&quot;=================&quot;Fall back!&quot;After nearly fifteen minutes of fighting, the invading Dreadknight finally calls for his forces to fall back. Holly sighs in relief when she peeks from the window and sees the skeletal archers disappearing into the wheat... for good, this time. She sends a silent prayer of thanks to the Lord of Light for delivering her home from the damned who rode against the adventurers and the militia. Death or worse awaited the faithful who dared to resist evil, if evil triumphed here.&quot;Why did they retreat?&quot; her dear husband, Alaric, asks. His eyes scan the horizon, looking for something off about the situation. &quot;They only lost one of their archers, and a single man-at-arms. We had the advantage, but they still...&quot;He looks at one of the buildings where that monster in mental crashed the door open with his great iron hammer. Even alone, a man in full harness is a force most folk aren&#039;t ready to stop. When backed up by hearty men-at-arms, well, the corpses of adventurers and Holly&#039;s neighbors thrown from the windows showed what that sort of force could do when determined. Perhaps they got what they came for, or perhaps they knew about the hamlet&#039;s trump card and fled...&quot;Men of Emberheart!&quot; a familiar voice cries. Martin Aurelion, the village&#039;s best warrior... if one did not take magic into account. &quot;Victory is ours! I say, victory is ours!&quot;Holly looks out the window, and sees the rugged man frog-marching a woman to the center of town. A beauty some men might call peerless, almost like that strumpet Erin who seduced the adventurers who had come to protect them in Lord Kettleburn&#039;s name with her sinful body. No, even more than that, and Holly could tell with just a glance that she too spread her legs for incubi that came in the night. A whore for demons.The woman&#039;s hair was meticulously straight, even the bangs, something she doubtlessly wasted countless hours upon in the morning when she could have simply kept it out of her face by tying it with a ponytail. Her build declared a maturity that her face did not, not a single wrinkle or laugh line or flaw upon her skin, a fresh-faced woman in her early twenties with the sinful curves of a woman matured. Curves she did not hide away from sight as was proper!"

Holly did need to box her husband&#039;s ears when she saw his gaze wandering the strumpet&#039;s body.Just like Erin the Demon-Whore. Holly thought to herself.&quot;I caught this Imperial trying to sneak into the granary and spread a blight among our stores as our valiant defenders were occupied with the the Dreadknight and his forces,&quot; Martin spells out the Empire&#039;s deceit for everyone to hear. His blade is raised overhead, shedding its blue light upon the town square. Anger spreads quickly through Holly&#039;s neighbors and the adventurers alike. &quot;What&#039;s more, it is she who commands the vile fiends that assailed us.&quot;&quot;I-I called them off!&quot; the sniveling whore has a tone desperation thick in her voice as the outraged gazes of the village fell upon her. &quot;S-So you&#039;ll spare me, right? Y-You promised me a t-t-trial with Lord Kettleburn, so...&quot;Anger fills the air - that the enemy who killed so many might be spared, might cut a deal - which Martin silences. &quot;I promised you no such thing, witch.&quot;&quot;But you said-!&quot;&quot;That you would face the light&#039;s justice if you cooperated,&quot; Martin tells her. Holly almost feels sorry for the demon-whore as her neighbors laugh at her. Just as they laughed at that dumb strumpet Erin as she wailed about &#039;saving herself&#039; when the adventurers dragged the demon-loving slut to their quarters. &quot;Lord Kettleburn is not the only light fearing man who can give justice in these lands. Men of Emberheart! What justice do we give to the demon-lover, whose foul minions butchered so many of our comrades?!&quot;&quot;Death!&quot; Holly&#039;s husband shouts, and she finds herself joining him. &quot;Death at dawn!&quot;The rest of the village joins in soon enough, and all that can be heard in the night are chants of Death at Dawn. The most sacred of times, when the Sun triumphs over the night and banishes all of its evils. There is no better time to hang a demon-whore strumpet from the lamp posts than dawn, and the thought has the entire hamlet enraptured for a few brief minutes. Until the village&#039;s trump card steps forward.&quot;Martin Aurelion,&quot; the ever-calm voice of the scion speaks. &quot;Your passion is rekindled. I am glad.&quot;&quot;Scion Juniper,&quot; Martin returns the holy scion&#039;s greeting with a nod. &quot;My sword found new purpose this night. It is grim... but I am glad all the same.

        "text": "How boring...Juniper knew humility. Juniper did not believe herself the strongest Scion in Kettleburn County, let alone the March of Edelweiss or the Thornlands as a whole. The blood of angels ran thicker in her father, for one. In his heyday he could call upon the sword of the Garden&#039;s Keeper, a blade of holy flame that purged all evil in a single swing. While such relics eluded Juniper, she possessed gifts enough that on talent alone she exceeded most adventurers. Growing up around such power, being given such power by her blood alone, this made all the peasants worries and desires seem positively droll. What did crop failure mean to someone who could effortlessly catch all the fish she needed with her bare hands? Why covet what your neighbor possesses when you can just hunt yourself a dozen bandits and buy whatever he had? Why obsess over petty things like the execution of this blackheart woman when mere skeletons die so easily?It&#039;s a shame she slept through the alleged battle. They said the bones were ironclad, but that cannot stop the gentle fist and its lifepulse from sending the dead back to their graves. Now she has to play the part her father assigned her.A judge to pull the gallows lever and execute a witless Imperial who tried to infiltrate a fortified hamlet alone.They even made her wake up before dawn for the execution. Martin captured the woman, and even suggested the ritual hanging at sunrise to symbolize the light triumphing over the dark. Given how passionate the dispassionate man seemed last night, she bet the woman bit him when he tried to have his fun with her. Martin never took his fun like that before, but the Imperial was even prettier than Juniper was. Pretty enough to stir the passions of the most frigid man for miles, and earn his resentment with her rejection.Probably.That was just speculation on Juniper&#039;s part. He marched her out of the warehouse cold as ever. He wore a dark hooded robe over his tunic and trousers, fitting clothes for an executioner. She could almost see the latent psychic power swirling in his eyes, potential he had left untapped for near two decades now. Martin&#039;s strength was peer to hers in his many years of torpor, so seeing his passion sparked again left Juniper excited to have someone to test herself against.The woman he dragged behind him was pathetic. She was tall, well groomed, and wore the toga of the Imperial nobility as well as anyone could. The iron brooch on her breast must have been the sigil of her house. The way she conducted herself, however, was entirely unbecoming of a Noblewoman. Tears streamed down her face in unbecoming rivers, and her voice filled with the whiny desperation of a woman who relied on men to save her."

The boos of the peasants are almost as uncouth as the demon-worshipper&#039;s composure, but that was to be expected of the little people. &quot;Come on, I&#039;ll sing any tune you want, I&#039;ll sell out anyone you want to know about! The dreadknight? The magister? The black priest? I know lots of things about lots of people, just please don&#039;t kill me...!&quot; &quot;Pathetic,&quot; Juniper grumbled beneath the din of the crowd.Near everyone came out to watch the execution. Most of the adventurers even joined, though a token few kept an eye out on the perimeter against the return of the Dreadknight. Unlikely. Most of his forces were probably back in Brightsprings, so it would be a few days until he could return... and even then, what could his skeletons do against Juniper&#039;s lifepulse? They would all crumble and die.The noble woman continued to beg as Martin read out her charges. Most of them trumped up, but it hardly mattered. The villagers wanted a sacrificial lamb to vent their anger at the Empire, and this woman was just unfortunate enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. There was just one thing that bothered Juniper.How is her evil aura so strong?She radiated evil like a blazing inferno, so intensely that she could barely feel Martin&#039;s psychic powers beneath it. Such auras meant one of two things: either she was powerful herself, or she had an incredibly powerful patron. Given the sheer pathos of the woman, it had to be her patron. Which meant that once this execution was over, she&#039;d need to visit Kettleburn and maybe catch up Marquis Edelweiss on his adventurism.&quot;You have all heard her crimes!&quot; Martin declares to the crowd once he&#039;s done listing charges. &quot;Grave crimes against the people of Emberheart, against the Lord of Light Himself! Scion Juniper, as chosen of His church and childe of the Angels, what say you her sentence?&quot;Juniper paused for a moment.She supposed they must have thought it regal, the ponderance of wisdom and the Lord of Light&#039;s mercy. In actuality, Juniper was a rather sloppy person, and needed to remember the right words. The crowd wanted the Imperial dead, so she had to grant that death the pomp they deserved. &quot;There can be only one sentence cast for her crimes. In the name of my great ancestor, the Archangel Yao, and in accordance with the teachings of the Lord of Light: I, Scion Yao Juniper, sentence you to die. May your soul find peace in the Lion&#039;s embrace.&quot;&quot;Y-Y-You can&#039;t do this...!&quot; the woman stammers out as Matin drags her to the gallows. She looks at him with desperation in her crimson bloody eyes, and slips herself out of her toga, letting it fall to her feet. It doesn&#039;t leave her nude, but the way the black garment beneath it clings to her like a second skin, she may as well be. &quot;M-My tits were famous in my hometown, you know? If you let me live, I&#039;ll let you touch them!&quot;"

Juniper smirks; she&#039;s tried that sort of maneuver to get a rise out of Martin before... to no avail. His voice is dry and unamused, though there&#039;s something in his tone that Juniper can&#039;t place. It&#039;s like he&#039;s disappointed at the situation. &quot;Is that really the best attempt at begging for your life that you can manage?&quot;A raven caws overhead.Something about the woman&#039;s demeanor changes. Her posture, her stance, the look on her face all shifts in a way too subtle for the crowd of peasants to notice, but immediately puts Juniper on edge. The tilt to the woman&#039;s head, like a confused puppy as she says something in a salacious tone that Juniper wouldn&#039;t have believed possible from her not a moment ago. &quot;Well usually I&#039;m the one making people beg. Besides, are you really saying that you don&#039;t want to give them a squeeze later~?&quot;Martin sighs, and whispers something that Juniper strains to hear. Something about this isn&#039;t right. No one goes from desperate to flirtatious as they approach death&#039;s door. Even as Martin puts the noose around the noblewoman&#039;s neck, every instinct in Junipers body is to spring forward and start pummeling the bitch with her fists.Then it happens. A rain of arrows descends falls on the square and before Juniper can shout a warning half the men of the village are dead.&quot;Martin, you traitor!&quot; Juniper shouts.Letting her divinity surge, her qi flowing through her body, Juniper rushes forward and throws a punch straight for his jaw. The woman in black intercepts, and Juniper finds her fist colliding with a plate of black iron as a demonic set of plate armor folds out across the woman&#039;s body. Her angelic blood, her decades of practiced cultivation should have punched through the woman&#039;s armor without issue, and yet she couldn&#039;t do it. It was like her strength had been reduced to that of a child, so proud that she could break a board of plywood that when she failed to break a brick it devastated her. They said the dreadknight was a man, but this woman... she&#039;s not just some pathetic noble! Those were the thoughts that ran through Juniper&#039;s mind as the real dreadknight caught her flurry of blows upon her plate and ignored them like a child&#039;s useless flailing. She ignored Juniper utterly, turning to Martin and telling him, &quot;The Angelblooded is mine. Aid the 4th Company and the Militia in butchering these wretches.&quot;Juniper dodged a lazy swing, but all the same she felt something. As if the very air she breathed became tainted by the mere presence of this woman. An intoxicating poison that burned her lungs and seeped into her veins."

She threw a mighty kick at the dreadknight&#039;s exposed head, shouting, &quot;Like I&#039;d let you!&quot;For a moment, she thought the woman stunned, her head flung back. Perhaps she broke her neck. But then, the dreadknight simply gave a crack of her neck, smiling as she recovered with only a bloody nose. A haunting, beautiful, and terrible smile. The toothy grin of a predator who just found herself some delicious prey.&quot;Who&#039;s letting who do what now?&quot; the dreadknight asks, and then her black blade flickered through the air. A wound sprouted from Juniper&#039;s side. It missed all of her vital organs, and yet at the same time it burned in the same way that the air burned. A burning pain that seeped into her blood, and a numbness that assaulted her every sense. As if the wound were trying to say: is this really so bad? Just give in and go to sleep, and all your worries will fade away.A part of her wanted to run away. These were only peasants after all, they didn&#039;t matter in the long run. They were just convenient pawns against the Empire, for Lord Kettleburn&#039;s ambitions to rid his neighbors of Demon Worship and claim new territories on the other side of the mountains. The warmth of her halo reminded her of why she couldn&#039;t let that happen.&quot;I won&#039;t let you butcher these people,&quot; Juniper hissed.She aimed another flurry of blows at the dreadknight&#039;s exposed face, each of them dense with enough qi to turn an ordinary man&#039;s head into a bursting melon. The blow seemed to stagger the dreadknight, making her drop her blade. The follow-ups only caught her armor, but perhaps the qi reverberated past it and burst one of her organs.No, that was wishful thinking. Juniper realized that when the dreadknight caught her arm as she pulled back, and pulled her into a hold that bound her. &quot;Let me butcher?&quot; the dreadknight whispered into her ear, her voice passionless and analytical. &quot;Just who is it that thinks they can &#039;let&#039; me do anything? Certainly not you, Angelblood. No, you&#039;re going to be far too busy from now on. Did you know? The womb of a woman with the blood of angels is the ideal incubator for something called a demonforge.&quot;Something sank in the pit of Juniper&#039;s heart when she heard the woman speak. &quot;W-What in the nine hells-?&quot;&quot;Congratulations~&quot; the dreadknight sounds horrifically sincere. An armored finger traces Juniper&#039;s torso, all the way from the neck to a place just below her navel. &quot;You&#039;re going to give birth to so many cute little demonspawn~!&quot;&quot;G-Get your hands off me!&quot; Juniper shouts, panic taking her."

She runs as fast as she can, fleeing past the screaming villagers as the skeletons cut them down. Militia from Goldgrain too appear to have joined, most of them young bachelors whose faces Juniper barely remembered. Martin as well, driving his sword of dreams through the heart of the last standing adventurers. The wound at her side burned horribly and wonderfully, the pain and pleasure seeping through her veins.She had to escape. She had to make it to Lord Kettleburn&#039;s estate and warn him of the dreadknight&#039;s forces, of her appearance if she tried to infiltrate another of his villages. But first she had to hide, and to heal her wounds before they took her.She found a place in the shadow of a mill. Between some boxes, out of sight and mind. With skillfull hands she pulsed her chi, a healing wave that should have cleansed her body of the wound and its the taint. The wound devoured it.And then, it devoured Juniper.=================&quot;Hah~&quot;After a hard day&#039;s work and a well fought battle, you&#039;ve commandeered the house of the now deceased headman of Emberheart and are breaking in his most comfortable chair. A glass of the headman&#039;s finest wine is at your side, a frumpy revenant you stuffed into a maid outfit is feeding you a cut from his fattest calf, and his wife is eagerly assisting your latest conquest in attending to your every need. As revenants, neither the headman&#039;s wife nor the Angelblood have technique half as good as your dear Tiff, but having both of them working the job at once makes up for their sloppy performance.Of course, with the fighting done, you didn&#039;t just run off to have fun. You had to secure the survivors who tried to flee or hide. Most of them the women, which means that once Varten comes up to Brightsprings you&#039;ll have a good amount of coin in your wallet. Legally speaking, prisoners are the property of the Dreadknight who takes them, after all. Once that finished up, there were petitions from the young men who came down from Goldgrain to fight for you. Largely, they wanted your blessing to take the women they captured as their wives. Being traitors to the Empire made that tricky, but honestly most of them were of an age with the bachelors. Women barely in their twenties, no doubt able to spin a sob story about being swept up in the foolishness of their families. Since they captured those women themselves, you didn&#039;t really have any legal standing to deny them what they wanted. You did, however, mandate that both they and their new wives accepted your profane gift, to encourage their loyalty to the Empire.By blood."

She does not hit for hard, but once she depleted Saligia&#039;s bulwark, she had a very real chance of punch spamming Saligia out of commission. That said, even with max HP, a d8 is a d8 whereas Saligia has a D10, an extra level, and 1 more con. 35/52 is closer to 35/59 as well; a threat, though in all honesty Abigail was probably stronger because - unlike Juniper - she had talent and worked hard.Now, Saligia hits like a truck. Even moreso against Good entities like Juniper. She also has a NASTY rider on that attack with Festering wounds. Both the expanded effect when she reached level 4 (slow chip damage to anyone who hasn&#039;t healed the wound dealt) and the &quot;Fuck you, make a Con save if you want to heal, and if you fail? Fuck you again, you take damage as if struck by the weapon&quot;. The one attack that Saligia landed lost Juniper the fight. Even with the mediocre Smite Good damage, she got fucked harder than Lady Brightspring after a long Friday night."

He&#039;s a professional, he has his own means of ensuring compliance without any spoilage.

She can pour essence into it to increase its corruptive effects, and it treated as if it were bound to her blood chakra. She can also suppress it at will, though while it&#039;s active it overwrites her normal bits (though not in a way that would interrupt a pregnancy, and it suppresses itself were she to give birth). The biggest difference is that unlike the Blade, the Bulwark, or the Breeches, her Lance is a Fleshwarp rather than a Relic.That said, I am in the air as to whether she can father children. My immediate thought is no, because she is a tool of corruption, but I am interested in hearing other thoughts.&gt;&gt;6272812&gt;Interesting, the doot made it seem like it was the armstrong memeIt&#039;s because she kept missing. She was rolling 3 attacks for every 1 attack Saligia took. None of her attacks rolled below a 12 (Saligia&#039;s AC without armor), so the fluff I went with was that she hit, but the armor ate the blow and prevented any real damage to Saligia.In that sense, it was the Armstrong meme. But had her misses hit, Saligia would have been much closer to down.&gt;&gt;6272881&gt;Though I do wonder what became of the Light Adherents children. They weren&#039;t mentioned before and we didn&#039;t really think to include sparing any in our orders if they were found (though they were spared in Brightsprings so perhaps it&#039;s standard operating procedure).Standard Operating Procedure is to secure them, keep them from harm, and let the Magistrate sort them out.

Your actions have proved you worthy of a second chance, but there are still assurances that the Empire would have from you. And then there&#039;s poor Miss Erin...&quot;&quot;What of her?&quot; Ragnar&#039;s voice is sharp and demanding, his desire to protect that young woman clear in his tone. &quot;Did you learn something from the adventurers before killing them? Was some sort of curse laid upon her? Did you-&quot;You chuckle at the young man&#039;s reaction. So easily deflected from his previous concerns about his neighbors, when the wellbeing of his love came up. Of course, his face twists into a snarl, but you wave this boyish anger off and tell him, &quot;Oh I&#039;m sure she&#039;s as fine as she can be. But won&#039;t she be missing her handsome savior? I know that if I were in her position, I would want to shower my rescuer with every affection a woman can give a man~ Did you at least kiss her before you ran away to talk to another woman~?&quot;&quot;I- she&#039;s not...!&quot; Ragnar&#039;s face has turned an amusing shade of cherry red. He points an accusing finger at you and the revenants attending to your needs. &quot;She&#039;s definitely not like you or those rotten adventurers. That sort of thing should wait for marriage!&quot;You disagree, but you suppose country folk value those rituals more than the pit-born daughter of a whore would. &quot;Very well! You have my blessing as interim governor of these lands to take Miss Erin to wife in the eyes of the Lawmaker. Marry her, shower her with affection, and put a dozen babies in her.&quot;Ragnar chokes out a cough at that last part. &quot;Is... is that an order?&quot;&quot;Yes,&quot; you tell him. Amusement has returned to your voice as he stays on the back foot. &quot;Though that is not the assurance of loyalty I need from you today. Holly, if you would?&quot;Ragnar eyes you strangely as you offer your wrist to the revenant maid standing at your side. With a wordless nod, Holly cleans the knife she&#039;d been using to cut your meat and slices open your wrist. Her skills as a housewife and maid become readily apparent here, as not a drop of your blood is spilled onto the tablecloth. All of it is caught within a silver chalice from the moment it starts pouring from your body to the moment your wrist is wrapped with a bandage. Holly then pours wine into the chalice, stirring it together with your blood until it is suffused throughout the expensive drink. Wordlessly, she approaches Ragnar with the chalice and offers it to him."

To drink of it is to reaffirm your loyalty to the Empire, and to accept the forgiveness for what crimes you have committed that hath been offered in exchange,&quot; you explain. He takes the cup, but he eyes the chalice suspiciously, not trusting the drink within. With a sigh, you tell him, &quot;You have my assurances that the children are unharmed and that the Empire has no nefarious plans for them. When the magistrate arrives in Brightsprings, he will make arrangements for their care and education.&quot;With a nod at that, he downs the chalice and immediately hisses in fleeting pain. The pact that he entered with you quickly spreads through his body, enhancing his vitality towards the peak of human endurance. A mark appears above his heart, in the shale of your personal sigil writ in black. &quot;Your assurances lighten my heart. Might I ask: what of the women?&quot;&quot;Those taken by Fionn and his men as brides will have their freedom just as you have,&quot; you tell him. So, the unmarried women who were there for their families, and not supporting their husbands&#039; foolishness. Fionn even took three of them to wife, a number that pleases the Debaucher. &quot;I have claimed Juniper, Holly, and... I don&#039;t know this woman&#039;s name, I think I&#039;ll call her Lupa.&quot;&quot;Her name is-&quot; Ragnar starts, but he missed the point.&quot;Lupa,&quot; you insist. After all, it&#039;s only right that you&#039;ve made the wife of the rebellious headman your bitch.&quot;Right...&quot; he doesn&#039;t go against you on this. &quot;And the rest?&quot;&quot;Those who survived the battle shall find a way to serve the Empire,&quot; you tell him. &quot;They have lost the privileges afforded the serf and the citizen, and shall from now on be slaves. I will promise nothing of their treatment, for not only shall that be the decision of their masters, but - quite frankly - I do not care what fate the traitor and the heretic receive.&quot;Ragnar&#039;s eye twitches for a moment when you say the word heretic... but now that he&#039;s imbibed of your blood, and shall soon wed a goodly woman who keeps to the Divider Lords, that annoying trait will leave him soon enough. &quot;May I have your permission to... browse? With my sisters marrying Conor and Daire, Erin and I would need help keeping my family estate in order.&quot;A frown crosses your face that even Juniper and Lupa&#039;s tender affections cannot keep away. After a moment of contemplation, you decide to pay Dormandal&#039;s kindness to you forward. &quot;If you&#039;ve family among the captives, I will happily release them to you in recognition of you deeds. They would need accept the same pact you have, but beyond that-&quot;Ragnar gives you a wry smile and shakes his head. &quot;No need. Mother and father passed of plague some time ago, it&#039;s just been me, Lizzie, and Sasha. Lizzie&#039;s been sweet on Conor for years now, and Sasha&#039;s not unhappy with Daire. Two people just won&#039;t be enough...&quot;"

Holly specifically pushing him back through the door, Ragnar unable to resist a woman in a maid outfit apparently.

All three of your newest revenants at once, atop the headman&#039;s wedding bed. Especially Lupa, there&#039;s something special about having your way with a traitor&#039;s wife and making her scream your name on the bed that she once shared with her husband.

The women have to proceed on foot, while the children ride along in a mule-drawn cart with that mannish revenant woman Martin took to bed last night. Fourteen fighting revenants is not so much less than fifteen that you&#039;d begrudge a capable second in command a warm and affectionate adjutant.Besides, her presence keeps the children in the wagon calm. They all chirp something or other about her being their big sister, and while she doesn&#039;t have enough personality to speak anymore, she kept enough of her old self to provide them with the requisite number of headpats and hair tussles. As amusing as it is to see the traitor women piss themselves in fright, surrounded by the fearsome bone boys of the 4th Company, you want to make sure the kids aren&#039;t frightened.Protecting the smiles of children is not why you signed up to be a Dreadknight, but crying kids are both annoying and would make you feel bad in your triumph.Only one of the traitors doesn&#039;t go with the procession. You smirk at young Ragnar&#039;s choice of housekeeper and nothing more. A fluffy eared wolfkin woman about his age who looks very fetching in the maid outfit and bright red leather collar than she now wears. Especially with how her bosom stretches the fabric to its limits, her generous endowments each easily the size of her head - if not larger. Her blue-black hair is perhaps a bit wild, and her brown eyes seem possessed with constant worry, though in your opinion that simply accentuates her natural charm.&quot;Oh my,&quot; you tell him. &quot;Miss Erin&#039;s going to be jealous, isn&#039;t she?&quot;&quot;I didn&#039;t buy her for that,&quot; Ragnar sounds offended as he hands you the agreed upon price. A thousand silver denarii is a steal for such a beautiful slavegirl. In the pits, to the right buyer, she could go for twice that much, perhaps even ten times to a rich client who wanted to touch fluffy tail. Giving men power over beautiful women is always a good reward for loyalty, and Ragnar has shown that - and the courage to speak up with he disagrees, a skill even more rare. &quot;She&#039;s an old friend, and I&#039;m only doing this to protect her from the consequences of her parents&#039; foolishness.&quot;&quot;Is that right...?&quot; you tease, eying the young woman. A wolfkin overflowing with youthful vigor. She withers under your gaze... and blushes whenever her eyes find Ragnar. You&#039;ll give him until her first heat cycle before the two of them are going at it like rabbits. Mercy unto Ragnar, that Miss Erin was strong enough in her beliefs in the Divider Lords&#039; teachings to condemn the rebels and be punished for it. &quot;Well, I&#039;ll leave you to your estate. Make sure to work with to Headman Fionn... and do inform me if he gets up to any youthful foolishness?&quot;"

Once proper supply lines have been established with the Pit of Beleth, you promise Fionn that you&#039;ll send some Skeletal Laborers for them to oversee.&quot;There will be no need, Lady Dreadknight,&quot; Fionn assures you with a bow. &quot;In my youth I traveled far.

The three young women who had been clinging to him (and giving you something of a stink eye) - the wives he took after the battle concluded - recoil slightly at the sight of the polished, bleached bone.

Not as durable as your iron-clad bone lads, but a step above the ordinary human skeleton. &quot;In thanks for giving my friends land to settle, and the opportunity to take such lovely women as our companions in life, I swear you this: my loyalty shall forever lie with the House of Clearwater. I shall make use of every skill and piece of wisdom I have obtained to enrich the lands you see fit to grant me, and see them kept safe from your enemies.&quot;With oaths sworn and a few more stagheads raised to cultivate the land, you leave Fionn to enjoy his married life.

The political situation is that the Edelweiss March sees the Empire as a threatening neighbor filled with evil demon worshippers (they are not wrong). The Empire sees the Thornlands as a minor annoyance, as they largely have control over the parts of this planet that they want to maintain control over to meet their strategic goals. The big lake by Oathbridge and Oliver&#039;s Rest is one of the &quot;Strategic Value: High&quot; things that they want to keep on this planet. Nothing on this planet is Strategic Value: Absolute, which would warrant expending the resources to conquer it (though the Empire will happily accept any territorial gains you can make, as long as it&#039;s not an overextensions and plans exist to hold it without increasing resource expenditure beyond certain thresholds)."

You and Detlev lead the procession on horseback, with your Skeletal Squire riding behind on his equally skeletal pony with your banner raised high and proud. Behind you, Holly drives the carriage that once belonged to the Headman of Emberheart, with Lupa and Scion Juniper remaining inside for their own protection. Behind them, the remaining revenants march in three rows, tabards hanging over their maille to give some semblance of uniformity to the men who only ever fought as a militia. The homesteads you pass prove friendly enough. Some are more genuine than others, but you don&#039;t care about rebellious thoughts at this stage in reconquering these lands, only rebellious actions. A few send their daughters to throw flower petals in the wake to greet your procession, as if you were liberating heroes. Others are more measured and cautious, clearly seeing the way the wind blows now that you&#039;ve moved past the bastion of resistance in Emberheart. One family has a particularly courageous boy - who could be no older than eight or nine - throw a stone at you, which clatters uselessly off of your helm. His parents look utterly horrified at what their son has done. Of course, the boy isn&#039;t finished with just a stone.&quot;Go back to the pit, you big mean demon lover!&quot; Every word that comes out of the boy&#039;s mouth deepens the horror on his parents&#039; expression, and his older sister is quick to try and pull him back. The little fellow is quite scrappy though, managing to wriggle free from his sister&#039;s hands. &quot;These lands belong to the Lord of Light!&quot;&quot;Heinrich, that&#039;s enough!&quot; his father shouts. The man, getting on into his early forties, looks at you with pleading eyes as you dismount and approach. &quot;My lady, please forgive my son&#039;s foolishness. He is but a boy, he does not understand the gravity of what he says...&quot;You march over to the boy and his sister, ignoring their father&#039;s pleas.The girl has the sort of fear in her eyes that would have been absolutely delicious to see on a woman grown. Tears well up in her eyes, and in the end she cannot bear to look at you in what she assumes must be her final moments. She clutches her younger brother in a tight embrace. The boy, on the other hand, has a good look in his eyes. He glares at you unblinkingly until the very end.You reach down at them both with a gauntleted hand, and-&quot;H-Hey!&quot; the boy&#039;s voice is suddenly absent all of the hatred and vitriol it held not a moment ago.

Expressions of dissatisfaction with Imperial policy can be tolerated, and productive expressions of such by the citizenry are cherished by the Divider Lords for the discourse they bring. A stone thrown by a young boy&#039;s arm is not a sword in the hands of the enemy. If anything, overreacting to such a childish slight is a weapon for the enemy to wield, and you are not in the habit of arming your foes.Yet all the same...&quot;There are plans for a branch of the Imperial Schola to be opened in Brightsprings,&quot; you inform the boy&#039;s parents. The two of them look at one another, uncertain of what you mean until you finish the thought. &quot;I look forward to your son&#039;s attendance, when its first semester begins. It would be a good opportunity for him - and all the children of the region, truly - to master his letters, numbers, rhetoric...&quot;The father pauses for a moment. He catches your meaning more than his wife, and from the lemon-sucking look on his face, he cares for it no more than he can oppose you on it. Still, he has to try wiggling out of it. &quot;As great an opportunity as it might be, are you sure it&#039;s not wasted upon us? We&#039;re simple farming folk, and-&quot;&quot;-should be afforded every opportunity to excel,&quot; you say, cutting off his argument. His wife nods vigorously, and it&#039;s quickly clear to him that he&#039;s lost the argument before it really began. &quot;Whether that&#039;s making your lands more productive through what he learns, or finding himself a stable position in the Empire&#039;s bureaucracy. In truth, I hope to see as many children from the lands surrounding Brightsprings enrolled as we can.&quot;Left unsaid is the why.Schooling is an excellent way to rid the next generation of their parents&#039; foolishness.The husband understands that. The wife sees the carrot but pays no mind to the stick, and with how easily her man folds to her whims here... they&#039;re not fundamentalists. They&#039;d rather see their sons and daughters live long, happy, and prosperous lives than have them die so stupidly as their foolish neighbors who threw themselves at you and your men in their pathetic rebellion. Once their son is down in the books for attendance at the Schola, you march off with your procession. Leaving behind a concerned father, an ecstatic mother, and two very confused - and somewhat relieved - children.Unfortunately, a child throwing rocks at you is not the worst thing you encounter on your trip east.&quot;Fee, Fi, Fum, For&quot;&quot;I&#039;ve caught the scent of an Empire whore.&quot;&quot;Fo, Fu, Fee, Fay&quot;&quot;How many more more will I break today?&quot;&quot;Fum, Fee, Fay, Frij&quot;&quot;A harlot knight seeks to cross my bridge...&quot;&quot;Fum, Fo, Fi, Fee&quot;&quot;But with what coin will she pay me?&quot;"

Heavy and misshapen, its eyes bulge out like those of a frog, its skin covered in a slick grease than vaguely smells of strawberries and rot. One arm is far larger than the other, which should have put it off balance, yet it moves with a disturbing and unnatural grace. Its skin has the color and text of steel, its nose large and hooked like a vulture&#039;s beak.Were it not hunched over, it would stand twice your own height easily. In one hand it holds a spiked iron rod and in the other it holds a great tower shield. Riding on his stomach is a more disturbing sight, a woman bound naked with chains like the Penitent Plate forged from the traitors and heretics of worlds declared Ad Nihilum. Those rare places where the excesses of total war and inhuman demoralization tactics were necessary to inflict upon the populace.You know not if the victim was a sympathizer to the rebellion, or an imperial citizen whose dignity must be avenged.What you do recognize is the symbol engraved upon her stomach that blazes in an accursed and sickly green fire. The same green flame that runs through the veins of the abomination that stands before you. A seal of many angles that speaks to the nature of the wretched thing this creature reveres as its god.&quot;Black goat, black goat, have you any wool...?&quot; the empty vessel, filled with the essence of the neverborn, croaks out in a mockery of song. &quot;Yessir, yessir, three bags full.

Ain&#039;t that grand.&quot;His body almost seems to teleport with how quickly he aims at you. You try to dodge out of the way but he already fired off six rounds before you could.Thankfully, your telekinetic field manages to block them. He&#039;s only using regular ammo - He&#039;s not even bothering to use anti-anomaly stuff! What a fucking joke!He grunts, moving to reload again. The two active Excisors launch towards your group to buy the CEO time. BELNOL raises its armblade up in an attempt to cleave Otto in half. It nearly manages to do so but Benedict moves in just in time to block it with his own armblade. Seething, hateful electricity roars throughout his blade but it&#039;s not enough to stop BENOL.Anderson and Maruyama immediately move in to help. A katana and an inky, melty rapier move in to help deflect what must be an insanely heavy blade. Otto takes this moment to quickly retreat from what would&#039;ve turned him into a pile of gore.The two are now struggling to keep the blade from cutting THEM in half. Their combined strength is barely enough to tie with BELNOL&#039;s. You need to find some way to help them but everything&#039;s moving too fast...The COWBOY EXCISOR grits his teeth. He raises his revolver in the air and all of a sudden, a thick layer of silver crystal coats his own six shooter. He snaps his aim right at Maruyama while he&#039;s too busy to dodge.Everyone else is too busy fighting to survive to notice that Adam hasn&#039;t moved. Instead, he has taken his sweet time to line up a shot on the CEO with that old MATTER ERASURE RIFLE you found a while ago. No one has bothered to pay attention to him. Even you didn&#039;t notice him until right now.A plan rapidly springs into mind. The CEO&#039;s stats are jacked - You&#039;re not even sure Adam could land a shot on him...not without some help.You yank your WATERLOGGED POCKETWATCH. The CEO immediately spots it and he tries to warn the two active EXCISORS to do something but it&#039;s too late.TICKTOCK!TIMEHASSTOPPED!The world is immediately awashed in monotone grey. Everyone around you soon locks into position as time itself screeches to a halt. Blood leaks out of your ears. The mere act of stopping time seems to be far, far too much for you right now. Something in the air feels wrong...&gt;YOU lose 1 FLESH and 2 RESTRAINT!Maruyama and the CEO are the only ones (besides you) to realize that time has stopped. Maruyama takes advantage of this oppurnity to slowly slice into BELNOL&#039;S ARMBLADE.The CEO scoffs, &quot;One of your old tricks, huh? Ya know I wasn&#039;t gonna be frozen. One on one duel, huh? Works for me.&quot;He aims his gun at you. Very. Very. Slowly."

He tries to pull the trigger but every small movement he makes stretches out for what feels like minutes. You yank the two IMPLANT INVERTERS out of your pocket. A shit-eating grin spread across the CEO&#039;s face. &quot;That won&#039;t be enough, punk.&quot; He hisses through his teeth as the two inverters are jabbed deep into his neck.

But I think you forgot someone.&quot;&quot;Feh. Who? There&#039;s only six of ya, right?&quot;You step away from the CEO so Adam has a clear line of sight when time resumes. You casually toss your two HEMOGLOBIN grenades at BELNOL and the EXCISOR, prime and ready to disable them once time resumes.You unfurl the scroll, not at all worried about the CEO still aiming at you, and you start to chant whatever is written on it. It doesn&#039;t take long until the three stunned EXCISORS are quickly entangled in golden string that ties their arms to their sides and their legs to the floor.Even if they weren&#039;t hesitating, they clearly aren&#039;t going to move for a while.&quot;It&#039;s seven, dumbass.&quot; TIMERESUMES!A massive beam of energy launches out of the MATTER ERASURE RIFLE. It slams into the CEO&#039;s chest before he even has any time to react. A large chunk of his suit and the flesh underneath it easily melts away under the sheer force of the rifle&#039;s blast. The overwhelming stench of burning flesh floods the arena. It almost reminds you of your parents for some weird, unexplainable reason.The CEO is sent flying back all the way towards the nuke, slamming hard against it. &gt;MATTER ERASURE RIFLE is now on cooldown!The two active EXCISORS soon realize their limbs are all sorts of gummed up from the grenades you threw earlier. Your allies quickly take advantage of this to land some serious hits on them.Lex charges his BOAR KILLING SPEAR with a torrent of energy from his power tattoo before shotputting it right at the COWBOY EXCISOR. It pierces cleanly through the cowboy&#039;s chest but, sadly, he&#039;s far too sturdy to die from it. He tries to fire at Adam but his limbs are too jammed up to aim properly. Most of his shots miss this round but two managed to strike true...but they hit Adam&#039;s BULLETPROOF VEST.Adam stumbles back but he doesn&#039;t seem that hurt, frankly. More annoyed than anything. &gt;ADAM took 2 (reduced from 8!) FLESH DAMAGE! With the gunk jamming up its limbs, the three allies fighting back against BELNOL barely managed to overpower them. Benedict uses all of his strength to shove the EXCISOR back. It is knocked off balance! Its guard is down!!!"

Thick layers of skin are peeling off of him, exposing the muscles underneath.The head-sized layer of necrotic flesh on his chest has now spread to cover large sections across his entire body. A thick layer of dead, blackened armor.A hole the size of your hand has punched into his chest. It&#039;s deep enough to expose his still beating heart - colored a bright, tainted silver. Weeping, bright white pus leaks out of gashes across his body. His body is barely able to handle the sheer amount of damage thrown his way (especially after you disabled his implants).

Your anomalous body (with help from your EVIGT IMPLANT) hastily repairs the wound by cauterizing the stump.&gt;You take 8 ARMOR PIERCING FLESH and RESTRAINT damage!And like he never moved, Liam is back where he was standing.

Now B-Corp is bad for copying you?&quot;&quot;Make up your mind!&quot;Adam and Benedict slowly begin to sneak up on the distracted CEO.&quot;They are nothing like us. They were a hasty, cheap replacement by the Head. We &#039;encroached&#039; too far into their domain. We &#039;redacted&#039; too much information they wanted to know. So they installed a puppet Company solely subservient to them.&quot;&quot;It&#039;s pathetic. If you are to copy someone, copy what is good about them.&quot;&quot;Maybe that&#039;s what they copied,&quot; Otto smirks. &quot;The fact you&#039;re a hastily ran, third rate company no one cares about.

He reels his fist back but Lex leaps in the way to eat the punch.It sends Lex slamming HARD into the cold floor below.&gt;LEX takes 5 FLESH (reduced from 8) and 3 (reduced from 4) RESTRAINT damage!Liam stumbles around from the sudden bodyblock."

Each one does pitiful damage to Liam&#039;s durable frame but each gash keeps Liam distracted.You charge forward with your FEDKILLER in hand, fully loaded with HIRCHSTONE SLUGS. You stuff the barrel right against his chest - BOOM! A fist sized hole is punched right into his chest. Liam tries to swing but you duck right out of the way.You reload and fire your last two slugs into his chest again. A second fist size hole pierces right through his body. The kickback is enough to knock him to the ground. He is forced to kneel on the ground now that his legs are torn to shreds.Maruyama yanks his GLOCK 83 out of his holster and, with what little time before Benedict&#039;s negation turns off, unloads every last round into Liam&#039;s body.They pierce through Liam&#039;s skin but with little to no obvious feedback. Maruyama throws his now empty gun onto the floor.The flames licking Liam&#039;s flesh soon extinguish. What now kneels before you is a smoldering, burnt hunk of flesh. Any semblance of his humanity has been beaten right out of him. Every bit of skin has turned into burnt pitch black. The only specks of color on him are from his failing implants leaking out their fluids through the gashes on his skin.And yet. He&#039;s still not dead.His hand pierces right into his gut, digging around it like a kid looking for candy. &quot;Y-y-yield my flesh. T-To. Claim. M-My. Bones.&quot; In one fluid motion, he rips out a long ornate broadsword from deep inside of his body. He forces himself back to his knees. &quot;I&#039;m not moving. This base dies with me. I. I won&#039;t let you win.&quot; His broadsword glows with an ominous silver light. Right as he pulls this stunt, you hear two familiar voices.&quot;We got here as fast as we could, partner!&quot;&quot;It appears you are attempting some corporate restructuring. Perhaps we shall help!&quot;&quot;Oh thank god!&quot; You turn to check on the two but, woo, they have seen better days. Their bodies have been torn to shreds by all of the fighting they had to do to get here. Exposed bone pokes out from their arms. Their eyes are nearly swollen shut from the black eyes they have. Large gashes that&#039;ll leave permanent scars are all over their bodies.But, they are here and they can help. That&#039;s all that can be said.Bennett finally drags himself from the blood pool he was drowning in.

You allow this thing, this entity, to escape your body.You feel your eyes roll to the back of your head. Something walks right out of you like you&#039;re simply a door.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1SbYeD1ZyM - THE ADMIRALThe entity standing before you is ancient looking man that towers over everyone else in the arena at a solid ten feet. His skin is beyond wrinkly and weathered, looking more like a well tanned leather than any other kind of skin. His hair, both on his head and beard, are encrusted in a thick layer of sea salt that has dyed his normally jet black hair bright white.An admiral coat, which has a black and white checker pattern all over it, loosely hangs over his torso. It is covered in every single possible naval and military medal recognizable to the average person. Benedict and Lex immediately recognize who this is and they scramble to get as far away from him as possible. The others are slower to react but the presence of the entity &#039;lightly encourages&#039; them to clear some distance from him.A bright blue glow pours out of his eyes. Grasped loosely in his left hand is a rusted saber. He points it towards Liam while giving him a cold, disinterested gaze.&quot;Y-you!!!&quot; Liam struggles to stand up. &quot;You betrayed us! You were supposed to work for us! Like every other anomaly! Why are you with HER?&quot;&quot;A banal question with an equally banal answer, Liam. She entertained me. A book that I feverishly read while I licked my wounds.&quot; The Admiral calmly stretches his sea-salt encrusted shoulders. &quot;I only wanted to watch your defeat in person - Without having to use her eyes to see it.&quot;&quot;I-I&#039;ll kill you! I&#039;ve killed ALEPHs before! I&#039;ve killed X5s before! I&#039;ve killed Keters before! Whatever name you want to use, I&#039;ve killed them before!&quot;&quot;Do you truly believe that?&quot; The Admiral shakes his head. &quot;I would label the nine humans fighting you, collectively, as an &#039;X4&#039;. Yet look at where you stand. On your knees, acting like a fucking child.&quot;&quot;You couldn&#039;t stop them. You failed your men. Your followers are being mulched above. You&#039;re a complete, utter failure, Liam.&quot;The Admiral steps away from the group out of sheer disgust of what he saw out of Liam. &quot;She&#039;s more of a leader than you are. I hope you recognize that - Maybe you can die with some honor with that toothpick of yours.&quot;Only when he gets pretty far away does anyone in your party speak up.&quot;Wait, he&#039;s not helping us?&quot; Otto chokes out.&quot;He&#039;s a sick bastard - He thinks this game is too easy for him.&quot; Lex grumbles.Liam forces himself up to his knees.

They aim their weapons towards the CEO - The one who refuses to die no matter what you throw his way.&quot;FIRE!!!&quot; You screech at the top of your lungs. For a brief moment, you thought you saw the Admiral smiling from the corner of your eye. When you turn to check, he has the same bored look he always has.Round after round of shotgun, pistol and assault rifle ammo pierces into Liam&#039;s body. Chunk after chunk of desiccated flesh flies off of his body. Liam finishes charging his blade...&quot;I will pray for you.&quot; Liam mutters before he charges down upon your group."

That&#039;s the last attack he has. His body is almost skeletal with how little flesh or muscle is clinging to him.

Your words are hollow-&quot;&quot;S-save the fucking monologue for someone who cares.&quot;So you do. You roughly toss him back to the ground. You telekinetically yank out your FLINTLOCK PISTOL and, with your last round, you blow out his one good eye. Ocular fluid splatters across your face and his screaming fills your ears but all of it elicits nothing in your mind.You smash the butt of your FEDKILLER against his jaw. Then again. Then again. Every strike distorts his clay soft jaw until the lower half of his face is completely obliterated. His tongue loosely flops out of his mouth. He gurgles out one last venomous jab, &quot;SEE YOU SOON!&quot;You press the barrel of your shotgun against his forehead. You slam the trigger HARD. An eruption of fireworks blows out of the back of his desiccated head. Drool pours out of your mouth - It&#039;s such a beautiful, delicious sight. You need to see more of this.Your antlers burn with pink light as you levitate the corpse of the CEO into the air. As easily as ripping apart tissue paper, you rip the half by pulling HARD on his midsection.The only thing connecting his two halves together is his intestines. You then move to rip his arms off. POP! POP! Then his legs. CRACK, CRACK!Oh, why the hell not, let&#039;s pop his head off! Not like it&#039;s doing him any good!SQULECH! Five detached limbs and two halves of his torso float in the air now. As your last act of spite, you slam the limbs down onto the ground. They splatter like blood-filled water balloons. Your outfit is drenched in another layer of human mess. You want to keep doing this-You feel someone shaking your shoulder.The pink haze fades away. You&#039;re now back in reality - Somewhat. You still feel like everything&#039;s swimming, like you&#039;re not really yourself anymore, but you&#039;re a bit more aware of what&#039;s going on.Oh. You might&#039;ve thrown those chunks a bit too hard. The only identifiable part of his body left is the two halves of his torso and some of his head. The rest is meat paste that sticks to the floor. You collect the head and torso chunks for, uh, trophy reasons.You can feel a dozen pairs of eyes staring at you with equal measures of concern, pride and fear. You don&#039;t care, though, you feel...You feel great. Everything was worth it in the end.Wait - Shit, the nuke!"

None of which are your allies, thankfully, but you didn&#039;t think that at first from how horrid most of your allies look after all of the fighting. Most of them are barely standing and, fuck, most of their weapons are holding together through sheer determination.Missing arms, teeth and eyes. Large, weeping gashes. Dislocated or broken legs. Most of them are not in a state to fight anymore. You need to get everyone to the surface ASAP so you can tend to the wounded. Your group lands at the top rung with little to no fanfare. You were expecting a self destruct sequence or some last minute attack but there&#039;s nothing. The only sound you hear is the ragged, exhausted breathing of your FAMILY.The trip up to the surface is oddly calm and empty. There&#039;s no one left. It&#039;s just you.

You think you managed to get everyone at least thirty feet away from the SPOOK. Nothing seems to be happening-You snap your head around just to be sure.The Spook&#039;s body is violently convulsing reminiscent of a man being electrocuted to death. A wave of misty blood sprays out of his mouth as he tries to desperately call out for someone. His eyes roll to the back of his head before he goes limp again. Frothy blood gurgles out of his mouth. A low, groaning sound drones out of him. He stays there for a good few seconds. It wasn&#039;t even satisfying to watch, you felt just kinda bad watching it happen.He falls back first onto the cold concrete street. You can barely hear his last words.Huh. Nothing&#039;s happening. W-weird. Is this some kind of trick?You feel something&#039;s hand on your shoulder. You turn around to see the loving couple themselves, Max and Benjamin.

Suddenly, a bone-chilling gust of wind blows from up north. Everything around you is starting to lose its coherency. The screaming only gets louder. Echoing, echoing. Something digs into your brain - Your antlers refuse to stop growing into the precious grey matter tucked away inside your skull.&gt;You don&#039;t feel like you anymore. +1 to all stats!&quot;Please. Please tell me what you see.&quot; You can&#039;t look away from what&#039;s in front of you. You desperately paw your hand for someone, anyone, who might be behind you. &quot;Is this real?

The pulsating swarm of flesh pours forward with mindless, unceasing hate in their glossy eyes. A tidal wave of flesh and silver. They&#039;re real. You have to do something and you feel like running away is fruitless unless you slow them down SOMEHOW.&quot;MAX! ANDERSON! BENJAMIN! HERE, NOW!&quot;&quot;ON IT!&quot; &quot;CHRIST, I THOUGHT THE FIGHTING WAS OVER!&quot; &quot;So be it.&quot;They scramble to your side with what little strength they have left. Benjamin forcefully manifests his wings with a sickening CRACK, watery and impotent oil dribbles out of Max&#039;s palms and Anderson lights one of his many molotovs.You prepare your POLISHED NOVASTONES.Everyone else is fucking running - They do not want to be anywhere near that horde (ESPECIALLY in the condition they&#039;re in). You can only hope you can buy them enough time.Max sprays a thick layer of oil between her and the enemy before chucking a small ball of oil towards the horde. It hits them but they don&#039;t even register it. Benjamin quickly lights up both spots of oil with his ASHEN WINGS. The front of the horde ignites into flames and, now blinded and on fire, some of them trip over themselves and are promptly crushed by their own kin. The thin wall of fire tricks the horde to slow down for a brief moment - Buying you and Anderson enough time to throw your consumables.&gt;71!Everything erupts in a bright white and orange light. Molotov after NOVASTONE after molotov slams into the crowd with little to no reaction from the horde. No screaming, no words, just the silent shuffling of hundreds of feet as they try to retreat from the fire.A smoldering wall of fire keeps the horde from trying to get payback from the PAIN you inflicted on them. Fire burns through the crowd without any sign of stopping, stinking the air with acrid smoke."

It&#039;s still growing in size but you stunted it for the time being. Good. Good.Thousands of eyes now stare at you. Waiting for you to make a move.You draw the HELIOS SEEKER. You raise it up to the air. You pull the trigger.Two bright orange beads of light pop up at the front and back of the swarm. You leap back right before a beam as wide as a sports car slams down where you were once standing. Nothing the beam hits survives. Flesh, bone, steel and concrete melt away just as easily as cotton candy when you pour water over it. The EXPURGATION PRODECURE pours around the beam as they charge forward but with the sheer amount of agents charging at you, a good chunk of the crowd is forcefully pushed in the way of the beam. The horde has been successfully slowed for this round.You take this moment to fucking book it as the beam melts through the crowd. You doubt the beam is going to last forever so you need to make as much distance as you can.A symphony of engines revving and confused, enraged screaming can be heard from the streets, buildings and businesses near where all of this is going down. You&#039;re sure some of your associates had to see this - You can only hope they can buy you enough time to get out of here.You weave into a narrow alleyway that you last saw your allies rushing down. There&#039;s one good thing about the City and its backstreets - There&#039;s enough alleyways and small, weird dead eyes to lose anyone chasing after you.You rejoin with Anderson, Max and Benjamin. Your other allies have about a five foot lead on you and you think you still have a solid sixty foot lead on the EXPURGATION PRODECURE. That&#039;s what you thought, at least.The backstreets you&#039;re in branches out in three different paths - North, east and west.The B-CORP THREAT EVALUATOR collar around Max&#039;s neck is beeping like crazy now. &quot;Shit! We&#039;re about to be attacked!&quot;Ashley yells out from the front of the crowd, &quot;EVERYONE, TO THE RIGHT!&quot;Your allies swerve down the rightmost turn and that was the right decision - Hundreds of OCEP agents suddenly flood the north and western alleyways. They smash right through building walls like they were nothing but tissue paper. They quickly pour after your group as everyone desperately rushes down the only safe alleyway.You turn around and you immediately regret it. A wall of flesh as tall as the buildings surrounded you is only about twenty five feet away from your FAMILY. With every second that passes, they close the gap inch by inch. You know for a FACT that if they catch ANYONE, they&#039;ll be beaten into a fine red mist. Instant death. Like a killzone."

She didn&#039;t move a single muscle over the last half hour. She watched your every move with the same smug smirk and a faintly amused glint in her eye.&gt;FIRST THRESHOLD PASSEDNo one else seems to notice her except for Benjamin.He nervously glances between you and the JUDICATOR. He&#039;s not sure if he should say anything but he leans in to whisper something to you.&quot;Uh. You do know who that is, right?&quot;&quot;What?&quot; You whisper back. &quot;That&#039;s an Elite Judicator. Kiara told me there&#039;s only 26 of them in the whole City - Why the hell is one of them here???&quot;&quot;I don&#039;t know and I don&#039;t want to. Just don&#039;t acknowledge her. Please.&quot;&quot;O-okay but...&quot; His words die before he can say anything else.You and your five allies climb into your car. It&#039;s a bit bent out of shape from some wayward hits from the EXPURGATION PRODECURE. Poor thing."

He&#039;s glancing behind him like he&#039;s seeing something no one else is.You decide to ignore it for now. You start the long drive towards the HEAD MEETING. From what little you remember, it&#039;s in the dead center of the City right where A, B, and C-Corp&#039;s districts intersect.It would be a long drive but you spot a VIP Limousine driving down the road. That&#039;s probably what Max and co. are driving.You simply follow after them. It doesn&#039;t take long until you are led down a private road that goes deep underground. The tunnel you&#039;re in is lit up with dark red emergency lighting - Probably got hit by accident when you were messing around in the STILLE DAG base.Your GPS went apeshit the moment you drove down the tunnel. Portal tomfuckery, you&#039;d guess? Probably some Y-Corp nonsense.https://youtu.be/NIWyZmFSep0 - CENTER OF THE CITY The trip through the tunnel cuts off abruptly as you&#039;re spat out into the streets of a completely different district. The dull grey buildings disappear and are immediately replaced with glamourous, luxurious high rises. The streets glimmer and sparkle under the dusky sun. The dark red hue that&#039;s settled on everything from the dusk sun adds a warmth to the otherwise tacky buildings.The road is completely filled with cars that all look exactly like the VIP Limousine you were following. The only reason you&#039;re not being escorted out is likely that they were informed about you before hand. Crowds upon crowds of star hungry Cityslickers flood the sidewalks, almost giving your group a heart attack after what happened only an hour ago.&quot;Woah.&quot; Clover chuckles as he processed everything he saw. &quot;Never expected I&#039;d end up in some glitzy place like this. Feels weird.&quot;&quot;A woman I used to know,&quot; Maruyama sighs. &quot;,would always complain about me not being able to bring her to a place like this.&quot;Dasha and Casey are stunned into silence. Dasha has no real way to process what she&#039;s seeing and Casey is just taking in the atmosphere.Your vision is assaulted with hundreds of flashing lights from the paparazzi scattered throughout the crowd. You can only trust that your muscle memory is enough to stop you from getting into a crash.The convey you accidently joined leads you and the rest of the VIPs to the main building itself. THE CITY HALL: HOME OF THE HEAD.It&#039;s a skyscraper that reminds you of that massive, massive beast of a tower you had to climb in R-Corp. But way more reasonable in terms of high. It stretches up into the sky like a hand reaching up into heaven. It glimmers with a light people like you could only see from a distance, never so up close and personal like this.Your convey heads into a private, secluded parking garbage attached to CITY HALL. One where paparazzi won&#039;t turn your vision into a glowing white haze. The end approaches."

I still worry that this isn&#039;t real. That I&#039;m still back there.&quot;&quot;The base. That felt real. I understood that. Fighting, killing, having to struggle for the right to breath.&quot;&quot;This. This feels wrong. I&#039;m not supposed to be here.&quot;You sorta get what she means by that. It feels weird for you to be here as well. &quot;I can promise you that this is real.

She&#039;s a G-Corp Rep. There&#039;s something different about her though. Something that you didn&#039;t notice before.

Long time no see, huh, Nicole?&quot; The G-Corp Rep(?) awkwardly laughs. The bags under her eyes already have two layers of bags underneath them. She&#039;s nursing a warm cup of coffee in her hand.&quot;...Have you been promoted lately?

Guess the last CEO wanted to retire so.&quot; She holds her hand out to you. Her hand almost looks like it&#039;s infested with something with how many calluses there are.You grab the G-Corp CEO&#039;s hand and shake it. &quot;Well, didn&#039;t expect to meet you like this. Are there any other CEOs out here in hiding?&quot;&quot;I think the D-Corp one is out here someone but beside her? Nope. Most of them are in some private room, talking about...CEO things. Some of the things you hear in there are disgusting.&quot;&quot;And most of them are about people like you.&quot; She points right at you. Huh? They&#039;re talking about YOU? You tilt your head but she doesn&#039;t elaborate from there. &quot;It&#039;s a shame, really. You&#039;d think you could do something with all of this power but when the a majority of the strongest people in the City disagree, what can you do?&quot;&quot;You can fight back.&quot; A faint smirk forces itself onto your face. &quot;Tell you what. I already know some of them want a big show - If you join me, well, you can punch one of them right in the face too.&quot;&quot;Stress relief is a very important part of a healthy work-life balance!&quot; Casey chirps.The G-Corp CEO stares at you like you suddenly grew five heads. &quot;I- Uhm. I&#039;m not sure how good the optics of that would be if I were to, uh, fight my. Urm.&quot;&quot;You&#039;re backing someone from your district. It&#039;s only fair, isn&#039;t it?&quot; You place down the APPENDIXED FROSTBITTEN TOME. &quot;Here&#039;s some payment for your trouble.&quot;The G-Corp CEO rapidly flips through the pages. The archaic lore tucked away in there immediately melts through any reservation she had in her heart. Guess that book is finally useful for something. &quot;I&#039;m in. Give me some time to get ready, though, I&#039;m still getting used to my new....body.&quot;&gt;The G-CORP CEO has joined your party(?).

It smacks into a random dinner guest with a wolf&#039;s head. His groans of pain are the only thing you can hear now.

You yank HARD on his tie to get him to shut up. &quot;ALL OF THIS TIME. WHEN I WAS FIGHTING FOR MY FUCKING LIFE. BEING HUNTED AND STALKED BY THEM FOR MONTHS ON MONTHS.&quot; Your memory on how long they&#039;ve deemed you a POI is fuzzy but it&#039;s been for a WHILE. &quot;AN UNCOUNTABLE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE TRANSFORMED INTO ANOMALIES TO THEM - NOT TO FUCKING MENTION THE UNDERGROUND FACILITY!&quot;&quot;AND YOU DID NOTHING?! YOU JUST THOUGHT, OH WOW, THESE SILVER GUYS REALLY ARE WEIRD! HAHA!&quot; All you can see is pink. &quot;BUT HAHAHA, SEEMS LIKE SOME RANDOM SCHIZO GIRL IS KEEPING THEM DISTRACTED, HAHAHA! WE SHOULD TOTALLY PUT ALL OF OUR FAITH INTO HER!!!&quot;&quot;EVEN THOUGH THEY COULD&#039;VE KILLED GOD KNOWS HOW MANY CEOS!!! I WORKED WITH ONE OF THEM!!!&quot; You pull tighter on his tie. The Host struggles to breath but no one is moving to stop what&#039;s happening. The corners of his mouth is twisted like he&#039;s about to smirk at any moment. &quot;SHE KILLED ONE!!! WHO KNOWS WHAT DAMAGE THEY&#039;D COULD&#039;VE DONE IF I DIDN&#039;T RAT OUT THEIR DOUBLE AGENTS HERE!&quot;&quot;OH! DID WE FORGET ABOUT THE NUKE TOO? THE NUKE THAT COULD&#039;VE TURNED G-CORP&#039;S TERRITORY INTO AN IRRADIATED HELLSCAPE?! THEY COULD&#039;VE DONE IMMEASURABLE DAMAGE TO THE CITY!!! AND YOU DID NOTHING?&quot;You let go of his tie. He stumbles away from you before reaching to clutch at his throat. He loosens it to make sure he can breath before he turns back to address you.&quot;Yep! After all, you won! You sent them into hiding. Why would we bother doing anything? The problem solved itself.&quot;&quot;HELL!!! WHY AREN&#039;T YOU DOING ANYTHING NOW?! THEY&#039;RE WEAK! DEFENSELESS!! YOU CAN KILL THEM NOW!!!&quot;The Host is oddly confused at your concerned tone. He clearly doesn&#039;t understand why this is riling you up.&quot;Why, it&#039;s simple! So you can keep fighting them! Oh, they&#039;re sturdy little guys, I&#039;ll give them that! They&#039;ll come back soon!&quot;"

That certainly was a speech.&quot; No doubt he would&#039;ve said that with some snark before but his voice is dry and quiet. This clearly wasn&#039;t part of whatever script he expected you to follow.The crowd is equally impressive, insulted and intrigued at...everything that just happened. You doubt they fear you or even &#039;respect&#039; you but you surely left an impression on them, that&#039;s for sure.&quot;Is that right?&quot; A deep, rumbling voice echoes from somewhere in the crowd. &quot;I&#039;d like to see that.&quot;You snap your gaze towards whoever just spoke up.

You need to get some fresh air after everything that happens.You cross the final threshold, passing right through the doorway.You&#039;re on a large, empty metal platform attached to the side of the skyscraper. The sun shines from the open ceiling. A large fence surrounds the edge of the platform to make sure no one can fall off by accident.The only thing on the platform besides you are two groups of thirteen podiums on opposite sides of the platform.

Dozens of eyes are staring down upon you with a mixture of intrigue, disgust, amusement, warmth and suspicion. You take a moment to get a look at what the CEOs, these elusive figures, actually look like. You already recognize Leoht (A-Corp) and the Trucker (G-Corp) but the others are a mishmash when it comes to their appearances.Some look like any other corpo. They have distinct colors on their outfits and sometimes they&#039;d wear something fitting the theme of their company (R-Corp&#039;s CEO wears a poncho and X-Corp&#039;s wears full tactical gear) and their corpo logo stitched onto their breast but other than that, they&#039;re just regular humans. You&#039;d say a majority of the CEOs look like, shockingly, normal peopleThe ones that catch your interest (and the ones you won over) are-A large, formless and endlessly mutating pile of flesh loosely piled at one of the podiums (F)-Squirming centipede legs and chitin that are only a fraction of some unspeakable large creature you can&#039;t even imagine the size of (Q)-An antique, bulky computer from the 1950s that has been upgraded and modified with so many spare parts it has somehow achieved sentience (E)-Fifty copies of the same man with the same shit-eating grin (V)-An eyeball the size of a small car floating in a jar of saline (B)-A desiccated corpse stapled to a cross. A large white robe covers her(?) decency (N)-A gaunt, eyeless man who&#039;s skin is completely caked in a thick layer of what seems like tar. He smiles at you like you&#039;re his daughter. (D)-What appears to be a DJ straight out of the 80&#039;s. Somehow he feels the most out of place here. (M)You can hear them muttering to themselves about you and the small outburst you had back in the BANQUET HALL (presumably they overheard the STILLE DAG thing). Their conversation is immediately interrupted by two CEOs crying out one single word - &quot;ORDER!!!&quot;A scarred hand and a large, metallic nozzle point at you.

While he&#039;s distracted is the best time to get this done safelySide&gt;[DASHA ALLY]Get the better gear + continue building up PURIFIER&#039;s rage&gt;[CASEY + CLOVER ALLY]Delay the distortion while we safely can. If Nicole becomes an anomaly mid-fight this early things will get bad for us real quick with Poia probably disapproving and the W-Corp CEO old lady going kill-crazy. We might have to resort to that GOT A GRIP main option eventually with how big that damage is going to be on him, so gaining stability now helps us to spend stability later if need be. The blood smearing option is absolutely important to make any real headway in this final boss fight, in my opinion&gt;Write-in: Pass the SPACE AGE COMPUTER CHIP and SPACE AGE SATELLITE TILE to the Y-Corp CEO. We KNOW about what&#039;s above like PROJECT THORN and it&#039;s cool (though Nicole is a City girl through and through and all her friends/FAMILY are here), so can the CEO help us out?Maybe also a small favor like getting the Y-CORP HANDHELD TELEPORTER to where our allies are, in case we need one of them that&#039;s healed up enough to teleport in here for a surprise backup? Hell, if all the others are together watching this climax battle unfold, they have to have all their items too. Lex for example has this shit&gt;FLESH OF THE SON (CLASS 2 RELIC CONSUMABLE. A small white cracker that tastes like nothing. Fully heals FLESH, removes all CRIPPLING INJURES or negative status effects, and adds +2d20 to the next dice roll the user makes.)Which is extreme value. That&#039;s just one example of what we could have the surprise backup ally bring with them. This is the final boss fight, surely this sort of &quot;unzip the BROKEN SHIT&quot; is allowed??? We have yet to do some insane thing like Maruyama using TEMPORAL REWIND to regenerate IN THE YEAR 2525 to have the epic reusable &quot;revert ally death&quot; item literally RIGHT IN FRONT OF ALL THE WING CEOS and on LIVE TV BROADCAST TO THE ENTIRE SETTING"

One moment it&#039;s there and the next, all that&#039;s left is the PURIFIER.The joint Dasha hit WAS a gas line, it seemed, but there&#039;s hardly any gas coming out of it.

You killed a CEO BEFORE!&quot;Naomi mimes slashing at her throat because, yeah, maybe that&#039;s not a good thing to say in front of a buncha CEOs.

It&#039;s like a dramatic reveal she&#039;s some hidden badass or something, huh?&quot;&quot;What an obvious twist. This is getting boring.&quot;&quot;THIS IS A DISGRACE TOWARDS YOUR FELLOW CEOS, PURIFIER. STOP WHILE YOU&#039;RE AHEAD.&quot;Your eye twitches. They&#039;re talking just like the guys in the room you just left.Whatever. You got this.&gt;48!&quot;Oh. I think you misunderstood her comment as a jest. A haha.

It&#039;s all just static and garbled garbage noise now. &quot;Then you sever the [EXPUNGED] [REDCATED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED].&quot; Drool oozes out of the corner of her mouth.

That&#039;s what we should focus on!&quot;You didn&#039;t get a single bit of that. The CEOs look beyond horrified at what she was saying (presumably they heard the uncensored version) and any banter they were spitting out has dried up immediately.PURIFIER #952 is too angry to really process what she just said in any real depth but it&#039;s enough to make it hesitate. &quot;HOW DO YOU KNOW ANY OF THAT.&quot;&quot;You think you&#039;d recognize one of your &#039;allies&#039;, PURIFIER. But I suppose you never really did care about the STILLE DAG after all.&quot;PURIFIER #952 lets out a small hiss of steam through a broken exhaust vent. &quot;OH. IT&#039;S YOU.&quot;Despite no one else because the CEOs understanding a lick of what Naomi said, the sheer energy behind her movements was enough to rile everyone up.&gt;EVERYONE gains 3 VIOLENCE and 3 MAX FLESH!&gt;MARUYAMA and BENJAMIN gain 3 COGNIZANCE!&gt;DASHA, CLOVER, CASEY and QUENTIN gain 3 TALENT!&gt;GABBY, NAOMI and yours truly gains 3 EXTRA VIOLENCE!&gt;MAX gains 3 CHARM!Good thing Naomi got that extra FLESH since PURIFIER #952 functionally teleports to her with how fast its moving.Its fist collides HARD with Naomi&#039;s stomach, knocking the wind right out of her, but it doesn&#039;t let it. It blasts a short gust of red gas right in her face in an attempt to kill in one go.Something shatters inside Naomi&#039;s pocket as she drops to her knees. Blood pools at the sight of the impact. It stains her uniform a deep, crimson red."

Clover&#039;s right arm hands loosely by his side. Casey, for her part, looks pretty fine actually.&gt;CLOVER takes 6 FLESH and 2 RESTRAINT damage!&gt;CASEY takes 3 FLESH DAMAGE!Seeing that Casey didn&#039;t take nearly enough damage, PURIFER #952 shifts over to another target. It picks up a discarded, spent casing and flicks it right towards Benjamin.It pierces right through his leg. A torrent of red, crimson liquid pours down Benjamin&#039;s leg—That had to hit some kind of artery with how much&#039;s coming out!The labcoat he&#039;s wearing to stitch together and cauterize it (with help of his powers) but yowch.&gt;BENJAMIN took 7 FLESH and 2 RESTRAINT damage!It tries to move again to rip someone to shreds but its damaged leg jams up again. Okay!!! Now it&#039;s your time to attack!You quickly supply everyone but Dasha and Gabby with grenades. You doubt this will really damage him but that&#039;s not the plan. The plan is to distract him for long enough to put the ACTUAL plan into motion.&quot;ON MY MARK! READY!&quot; A chorus of eight grenade pins being yanked out ring through the air.&quot;FIRE!&quot;Grenade after grenade is tossed at the PURIFIER&#039;s feet. It tries to kick some of them away but Max rapidly spreads a thick layer of oil onto the floor. The oil causes the grenades to slide right back to the CEO&#039;s feet.A few grenades manage to land inside of the CEO&#039;s body through some lucky tosses. You even spot that a few of the ones that got inside are coated with oil. Devious. Even if Max herself can&#039;t do much damage, fire is fire.Everyone immediately scrambles to the far, FAR end of the room to avoid immediately getting maimed by the explosives. The other CEOs don&#039;t bother to even move (they got enough FLESH to tank it).The PURIFIER&#039;s leg unjams right in time for all thirty grenades to explode, one after enough. Puff after puff of white and grey smoke fills the air around the PURIFIER until there&#039;s a whole cloud of murky smoke lingering around where the PURIFIER was.It stumbles out of the cloud looking like it just came out of a house fire. Black ash cakes its body from head to toe, blurring any real detail its body once had. Its LED eyes are heavily cracked, nearly broken, from the sheer amount of shrapnel stuck inside of it.A dull orange glow pours out of its vents. It&#039;s burning up from the inside out but it seems more focused on beating the shit out of you than a simple internal fire.It flexes its regular arm which is laced with shrapnel sticking inside its slightly melted metal &#039;skin&#039;. It swings its arm around to send the shrapnel flying in all directions."

Three rings of grey light encircle the wrench right as she swings it down onto the PURIFIER&#039;s head. A dent forms on the site of impact. More and more dents form with every reckless swing she throws at her fellow CEO.&quot;FINE. I&#039;VE IGNORED YOU FOR LONG ENOUGH.&quot;PURIFIER #952 decides to trade blows with his fellow CEO. Every swing she throws is met with a horrifically visceral gut punch. Gabby easily eats the first dozen gutpunches but every single one is weakening whatever mods her body is juiced up with.In a blow to blow fight, it&#039;s obvious who&#039;s going to win, even with how injured PURIFIER #952 is and how relatively injured Gabby was.All of his attention is focused on Gabby. Just as planned.Dasha carefully sneaps up behind the PURIFIER. She carefully loads in the GODKILLER ROUNDS with the surgical precision necessary for a plan that has your life on the line.Benjamin points out the weakpoint that Dasha should be targeting.She raises the barrel right towards the weakpoint: A nearly invisible maintenance panel. A panel that holds some very, very delicate internals that would be easily damaged by basically anything.She steadies her breathing. Everything is counting on this.Blood sprays out of Gabby&#039;s mouth, staining the PURIFIER&#039;s blackened body. She can&#039;t take much more of this...&gt;GABBY took 75 FLESH damage!&gt;49!The eight bullets land their mark. Their protection-negating property was enough to easily damage the screws holding the panel together. With a large CLANK, the panel falls off to reveal the soft insides of this crab of an enemy.The PURIFIER immediately stops what its doing. &quot;NO, DON&#039;T YOU FUCKING DARE-&quot;Every single ally with a gun aims at the wiring, computer chips and other delicate internal machinery expected of a sentient robot like this.There&#039;s no point saving any ammo when a chance like this reveals itself.Dozens on dozens on dozens of bullets fly from everyone&#039;s guns (including your own). Wiring is torn to shreds. Chips are shattered into tiny pierces. Cooling mechanisms are immediately broken beyond repair. Capacitors and transistors are shorted or burnt until they&#039;re no longer functional. The PURIFIER manages to reposition itself in such a way where you can no longer target the exposed weakspot but by the time it managed to blitz away, you can tell you fucked up its internals by a LOT. Its movements are a lot more sluggish than they were moments ago. Its limbs randomly lock up far, far more often and occasionally, its LED eyes would sometimes just stop glowing outright. You HURT it in a way that actually mattered"

You don&#039;t care about how much pain you had to endure to get her.[GOT A GRIP] Even if it means becoming a monster, you&#039;ll do everything you can to protect your FAMILY.Every last bullet your allies have are fired right into the molten remains of the CEO. Each one dents and twists its soft, molten body. Gabby&#039;s wrench rips right through its soft molten body, sending droplets of molten slag splattered onto the floor.Even with all of this. Even with every bullet and wrench and sword swing piercing through his body.It refuses to die.&quot;CHARGING. BUMPING UP DAMAGE TO 500. BRINGING. YOU. DOWN. WITH. ME.&quot;Suddenly, something changes inside your body. You feel lighter. Lighter than the air itself. Your body begins to float up into the air as if gravity itself no longer holds any meaning to your vessel.Your allies are too distracted to realize what you&#039;re doing. Good. You don&#039;t want them to see what&#039;s about to happen.Strings rip right out of your feet before embedding themselves into the floor to keep you from floating away from the arena.Your body goes slack. Your muscles are refusing to listen to you anymore. All that you can control at this point is your own mind. Your vision swims with brilliant pink light. Every impulsive thought. Every emotion your exhausted soul has held back for so, so long has finally been given a chance to shine freely.Thick layers of skin peel off of your body in ragged sheets. They splat onto the floor like the discarded remnants of a vessel that they are.Hundreds of strings erupt out of the ground right by the PURIFIER&#039;s feet. Layers of layers of them wrap around its lower body until all you can see is pink, glowing string.It begins to compress its legs through telekinetic force. The metal twists, tears and crunches under the sheer gravity pushing down upon them but you&#039;re not done. You don&#039;t want to leave it a single opening to even THINK of hurting your allies.The metal floor around it begins to twist and tear under your telekinetic strength. Hundreds of pounds of metal are being shifted and molded under the floor. It&#039;s almost as easy as messing with those little cans filled with modelling clay you used to have as a kid.You remember how happy your dad looked when you made a cute little deer out of pink clay.You think he took it to his workshop so he could put it into a klin. So it could stay as childish and messy as the moment you finished making it.You don&#039;t know what happened to that statue but you feel like it&#039;s still with him. Wherever your father is. Wherever your mother is.Wherever your real family is.Does it matter anymore? If you can&#039;t remember their faces? Their voices?"

Dozens of small metal icicles are thrown into its soft and squishy body.The floor around you is torn to shreds. Large, open holes that lead down down down down DOWN DOWN hundreds of feet scatter the arena. Exposed wiring crackles with pink FREEDOM. The air itself begins to stain a bright, brillant PINK. A-Energy counters overflowing until the meters reset to the negatives.Someone shouts at you to stop. To listen to them.You can&#039;t control yourself anymore. This is better than sex - Better than murder - Better than the best drug you&#039;ve ever had in your life.One last icicle pierces into the PURIFIER&#039;s body. [CONNECTION UNSTABLE]The PURIFIER&#039;s body glows a bright, brilliant red.[LOSING CONNECTION WITH NICOLE IN 10...]And with a resounding, glorious POP, the PURIFIER&#039;s body erupts into an explosion strong enough to shake every last square inch of the arena. Chunks of molten metal from the icicles impaled to it are sent scattering across the arena. Your FAMILY scrambles for whatever cover they can find.Something heavy slams into the floor. The mangled remains of the PURIFIER or, well, what&#039;s left of its upper half. Everything from the &#039;waist&#039; below has been melted away or torn off completely by your attack. What&#039;s left of its body is a rusted, mangled mess that is beyond repair.A thick haze of gold and red mist erupts out of the bottom half of it with seemingly no end to it. The whole arena floods with it, spilling out into every last corner.But. Whatever potency it had has been severely nerfed."

You doubt anyone else could&#039;ve molded so many pounds of metal into an attack like that.You check your guns. All you have is five anti-anomaly rounds and seven rifle ammo.You don&#039;t like where this is going.

No one will shed a tear for that traitor.It doesn&#039;t take long for you to find your leader. She&#039;s barely able to prop her body off of the floor with her hands.

They try to say something to get her attention but she&#039;s not acknowledging them. Odd. She&#039;s usually the type to dote on the freaks and fools she&#039;s gathered. Though you&#039;re a fool too for working with her. Ha.&quot;i won. i WON. I WON! I WON!&quot; She beats her hands- no. Hooves. They&#039;re melded together into one collective mass of keratin."

Ha.&quot; Benjamin awkwardly rubs the back of his neck. &quot;We&#039;re not here to fight you.&quot;Yeah! We&#039;re simply here to offer you a deal. A mutual exchange that benefits both of us. You can understand that, right?&quot;&quot;A..Deeaalll. L-like an ALlianceshiiip?&quot;&quot;Yeah! Yeah, we can become your allies!&quot; &quot;Sure, it might cost you some money but we&#039;ll be with you thick and thin!&quot;&quot;What do you got to offer?&quot;While they&#039;re busy trying to talk the anomaly down, you slowly sneak past the anomaly. You&#039;re good at staying in people&#039;s blindspots - It probably already forgot you&#039;re even here.You can only hope whatever they&#039;re saying to the anomaly is enough to keep it from noticing what you&#039;re doing.You search around her body (which is getting bigger and more mangled by the second...) for wherever she kept her abstracted &#039;inventory&#039;. You soon find a satchel made out of rotten skin and tooth enamel hanging off her side. You dig through it for the teleporters she managed to bribe from the Y-Corp CEO...And there we go! They&#039;re a bit slimy now but they&#039;re still functional! &gt;You obtain the excess TELEPORTERS!You scramble back to join up with the others to see if their sweet talking was enough to keep the anomaly stabilized.&gt;58!The anomaly&#039;s gaze is firmly locked on the ground. Its body has slumped over even further than it was a few moments ago to the point where it&#039;s only barely propping itself off of the ground.Its breathing is heavy and slow. Almost like the anomaly is asleep. Every deep, heavy breath it lets out floods the air with even more A-ENERGY. It&#039;s in a stupor, unaware of the world around it.You fiddle with the teleporter. It takes you a moment to remember where the chef and his little freak went to heal up at but you quickly teleport them over to join you in this hell of a finale.The two pop into existence as if they were always meant to be here.They&#039;re about to ask you why the FUCK you brought them here but you silently point towards the entity only a few feet away from them.That quickly brings them up to speed. The two instinctually move to draw their weapons just in case things get any worse. For the time being, though, you&#039;ve calmed down the anomaly. Guess you can say the APPEASE work was a &#039;good&#039; work result."

Beats some sense right back into her on a success, allows her to speak more coherently. The others won&#039;t like you doing this.)&gt;[CLOVER + MARUYAMA ALLY] You need it to get it to remember you. Let the two most heroic fools BOND with this entity. (MODERATE? WILLPOWER DC: 76, rolling 20d6. Brings back some of her memories, opening a better line of communication if you succeed.)&gt;[FRIEND INSIDE HER] You need to help the entity inside her. Find a way to communicate with it - Maybe even weaken the anomaly&#039;s grip on it so it can escape. (MEDIUM RESTRAINT DC: 46, rolling 13d6 with Casey&#039;s help. Removing the extra anomaly from her system should purge some of the excess A-Energy. Buys you an extra turn to calm her down.)&gt;[GABBY, MAX and ADAM ALLY] Her body is clearly injured despite what your instincts are telling you. You need to NURTURE and HEAL her. Scrouge up whatever healing supplies you can. (MODERATE FLESH DC: 59, rolling 16d6. Healing the body will heal her mind. Negates the negative reaction of ECSTASY. Earns the approval of the others.)&gt;[QUENTIN ALLY] &quot;YOU ARE NOT A FREAK. YOU ARE NOT A MONSTER. YOU ARE LOVED.&quot; The bug wishes to speak to the monster. Let it BOND with her.

Showing her proof might just work.)&gt;[BENEDICT ALLY] You heard he has the ability to weaken fellow SHIFTers and anomalies. Test out his power on her. SUBDUE its powers. (No dice required. Weakens her abilities for this turn and clears some of the funk in her head. It&#039;s hard to say how effective or long term this will be, though.)&gt;Say something to her. Off the cuff.

Something in the air is beginning to shift.The anomaly&#039;s body begins to rapidly expand and contort into something distinctly non-human. Its front arms twist, crack and bend until they fully resemble deer legs.Its torso bloats with pus and cystic fluid. Skin peels off in heavy layers to reveal nothing but pink fur underneath.It smells like it died many, many days ago and you just found her- it outside under the scorching sun.Small Your face knots into something ugly. You&#039;re disgusted. This must be what that &#039;Wendy&#039; schizo must feel whenever they had to look at Nico- it. Don&#039;t think of it as Nicole right now. Don&#039;t.Something is budding out of its swollen, fluid-filled torso. Small little buds of keratin and bone poking through its rotten flesh. Antlers. Growing throughout its back.You need to do something before this is irreversible. &quot;Benedict. I watched you fight my, uhm, &#039;former boss&#039; as it were. Did you use an ability to disable his copying powers?&quot;&quot;Yeah but why- ghhh.&quot; He hacks up a thin mist of blood. His lungs must be getting torn to shreds. &quot;Why exactly do you ask?&quot;&quot;Try to use that on the anomaly. See if it grounds it.&quot;&quot;If this kills him, it&#039;ll be on YOUR ass.&quot; Adam jabs his knife in your direction. You roll your eyes at his threat, not like he could do much to you.Benedict slowly and cautiously approaches the anomaly. Every single movement he makes is carefully thought out to avoid spooking the anomaly. You could almost hear his thoughts just by seeing how he&#039;s acting.[&quot;I know she has to be hurting inside.&quot;] Something like that.His armblade transforms into a regular, if limp and pale, hand. He presses the palm of his hand against one of the anomaly&#039;s front leg as he starts to channel his power through its body.&quot;HHH!!! HHH!!!&quot;The anomaly&#039;s body begins to seize and squirm the moment Benedict&#039;s ability starts coursing through its body. The fetid stench of burning flesh mixed in with cotton candy floods the room. Benedict grimaces at the sight unfolding before him but he doesn&#039;t stop. Good. Healing requires pain, as it were.The anomaly&#039;s body begins to recede back into something more &#039;human&#039; sized. Antlers shrunk, limbs shrink, pus drains onto the floor from pulsates popping open. Layer after layer of half rotten flesh and fur flake onto the floor when there&#039;s no room on the now far, far smaller body for them.What&#039;s left after Benedict pulls his arm away is something that vaguely resembles Nicole. Her arms are still mutated into deer legs and you still can&#039;t see her face but she&#039;s &#039;human&#039; sized now. Back from the brink. Even if only for a moment.&quot;W-whWyyy. Tthaattt hurts. Whwyy did you do that, Be..ummm...where&#039;s...mom. i want my mom. where is she...&quot;Benedict&#039;s expression twists into something inscrutable. Yet you can read the poor bastard like a book. He clearly sees his past self in the anomaly."

Great. You hope you can stunt this thing out of your brain soon enough.The pink miasma that flooded the arena thins.

Worried that if she loosens her grip for even a moment, you&#039;ll disappear. Your single good eye stares at her only visible eye.The both of you decide that, for now, it&#039;s fine to not see anything. To just enjoy the touch of another.That&#039;s where you stay for the next few minutes. Occasionally, the silence is broken by the tell-tale beep and fizzle of people being teleported in.You weren&#039;t the only one who hugged her. Many of her allies would pass by to offer her a hug of their own. Sometimes, it would be genuine. The brute with blood powers, the foolish bird and the oil-soaked Krakatoa, and the two bugs made sure to show their love to her.Sometimes, it would be out of pity. The chef and the one with the armblade, the business woman from I-Corp, and the red haired punk took a while to decide if it was okay to do it.A few didn&#039;t bother. The ETF Agent, the W-Corp Rep, her boss and the former painter turned Stille Dag asset were too uncomfortable and/or were insulted by the idea of having to hug her.But, slowly, everyone who wasn&#039;t outright uncomfortable with the idea moved in to offer her the only thing that could at this point. A hug. A tender touch. You think you even saw that one android kiss her while Nicole wasn&#039;t looking.You open up your eye to see that you&#039;re no longer in a miasma filled abyss. The arena you&#039;re in is now visible. The walls and floor have been torn to shreds by Nicole&#039;s outburst - It&#039;ll take weeks for repairs to fully the damage she did to it. Holes the size of small boulders have been punched into the floor, walls and podiums. Pink energy crackles from the edges of the holes, burning away at them like fire eating through paper.Where there was once a monster, there&#039;s simply Nicole. Her antlers, her fur-coated body and her cloven feet are still there but it&#039;s all been compressed back into her humanoid form. She&#039;s never going to be fully human again but...was she ever?She&#039;s clinging into you for dear life. Afraid to let go. That this is all just one long, cruel joke her mind was playing on her.&quot;You asked me if you were a good friend, yeah?&quot;Another choked whimper is all you get as a response.&quot;You are a fool. You&#039;re our fool, though.&quot;Another whimper comes out of her but this time, it sounds happier? Or, at least, you think she was trying to thank you there.You slowly unwrap your arms from her. She nearly collapses to the ground but Casey, Lex and Clover move to catch her.The whole entourage escorts her out of the arena. You&#039;re the only one who stays behind. There&#039;s something you have to check up on here. See, you were ignoring the three stragglers in the arena. Watching the tender, emotional display.The torn, barely alive K-Corp CEO lays limply on the floor. What&#039;s left of its body is nearly unrecognizable."

God, you don&#039;t want to think about it. Your eyes are starting to water again.You&#039;re being escorted out of the building by your allies. Naomi was gone for a while, god knows what she was doing, but she seems to be happy so. Good for her.You can hear people screaming and begging for your attention. For autographs, to ask about what happened underneath the miasma, to show off your powers to them.But your allies keep the worst of the paparazzi from bothering you.You&#039;re now back in a private park of the parking garage meant for V.I.P. Whatever VIP means. Your brain feels like warm banana pudding being pushed through a strainer.What you do know is that you somehow got a fucking $625k payday out of all of this. Naomi said something vague about it being a &#039;gift&#039; from the L-Corp King but she refused to give any more details.Whatever. You&#039;re just glad to have your senses back. Your allies are scattered all throughout the parking garage. Feverish discussions about what they should spend their money on fills the air. Some want to invest it into some promising businesses. Others want to go on massive benders. Some just want to save it and to take a long, LONG vacation. Some of your excess favors were used to pull some strings and, with what few items you had left, you sold off most of them to make some extra cash. All in all, you managed to earn about a grand total of 3.2 million after everything was said and done. Granted, most of that came from the favors and a few other pricy trinkets you got, but FUCK!You never thought you would have 3.2 million dollars EVER.That&#039;s enough money that, if you used it wisely, you could retire off of and not have to work for like...twenty years? Probably longer. ESPECIALLY with the ties you have to some brand-new famous Stars of the City.The question is, what do you do with this money? You never really had time to properly save any real meaningful amount of cash before.You can already tell some of your allies are going to spend it on benders or they&#039;re just going to invest it in some shitty meme stock but. Hey! It&#039;s their money and you really have no right to judge them. Especially after everything you asked of them.Choose how you wanna invest your money, Nicole. Pick the four things you want most.While you&#039;re at it, choose where you wanna celebrate. The last celebration before the story concludes."

From what you understood, your influence is enough to buy you roughly 3000 G-Corp shares at about $500~ each.It&#039;s still a drop in the bucket compared to what someone like Alexis, Otto or Max might have but it&#039;s an insane amount of stock for any random Jane to own in ONE OF THE TWENTY SIX LARGEST COMPANIES IN THE WORLD.You can only hope you&#039;ll get your return on investment. If not, oh well, you helped the company that raised you. You think that&#039;s worth it. And finally.&gt;SHIFTER!It took a while for the researchers to calm down after you told them you wanted to invest in them.It took even longer for them to finish harvesting samples from your half human, half anomaly body. It took an insultingly long time for them to actually take your money instead of letting them draw more blood or letting them borrow your FEDKILLER for &#039;energy spectrum analysis&#039;.You had to explain what you actually wanted them to use the money for."

After everything is said and done, you&#039;d guess you have a total of $100,000 left in your personal balance.Not enough to meaningfully invest into anything grand and it&#039;s only a year&#039;s worth of money to live on at best. You might as well save it for personal expenses and such.The investors, reps and other corporate goons all leave your allies be after the flow of money and opportunity dries up. It&#039;s just you and your 20~ allies. Hm.You tell your allies you want to go somewhere quiet after everything that happened. Somewhere far away from all of the hustle and bustle of City life.Vincent speaks up for the first time in what feels like ages, &quot;Why not O-Corp? I heard a lot of people take vacations to some rural towns down there to just...decompress.&quot;It&#039;s quickly agreed upon that&#039;s where you&#039;re going to head to.https://youtu.be/glHl7Gj-Za0 - ?It&#039;s in the dead of night when you finally arrive at the edge of the O-Corp owned town &quot;Olataw&quot;. You&#039;re in a deep, DEEP dark forest with no signs of civilization aside from the woodlog cabin right in front of you. The half dozen cars your group have to drive in from all go cold now that you&#039;re at your destination.The only other thing besides the cabin you see is an old dirt path leading to, if the brochure was correct, a large field. Just like what you wanted.You take a deep breath of the fresh country air. It&#039;s weird being out here. You&#039;re so used to metal and ash being what the world was built out of. You doubt you&#039;ll ever be comfortable living outside of that.But.You suppose it&#039;s only fair that a deer returns to the forest, no?Huh. You notice something as you watch the others heading into the cabin. You don&#039;t hear any voices in your head. No UNSTABLE, no SEEKER, nothing. Pure and blissful silence.Did they get purged when you became an anomaly? Did you manage to become a well adjusted person? Heh. Hehehe. Yeah, wow, you wish you could&#039;ve gotten that ANY other point in this story.You head down the old dirt path. There&#039;s nothing but the company of trees on this lonely trail. Good. Keeps your head clear. Better for your mind. At the end of the trail is what you expected. A large, rolling field that has nothing but short grass. The treeline clears just enough for you to see up into the night sky. You find a nice comfortable patch of grass to lay on. Your eyes gaze up into the starry sky.Dozens, no, hundreds of stars glimmer above. If you squint you might be able to see the Y-Corp space station that&#039;s up there but besides that? Dark, navy blue sky. Shimmering white stars. No light pollution. No smog. Just nature and the infinite comsos."

You&#039;re pretty sure all of your allies visited you over the course of the night. Some came to make sure your mind was still there. Some came to give you food and water. Some came just to talk about the good old days. Hell, some didn&#039;t say anything at all. You were shocked when Frank was the last one to arrive and all he did was just stared into the wine-dark sky alongside you.You suppose he was never one for big social events. You offer him a faint nod to acknowledge his presence before you focused your attention back into the starry night sky.Peace and quiet. A completely foreign concept to you given how busy your life has been. It&#039;s not something you dislike, though, it&#039;s just. Different.Hours pass by and all you can really think is that, well, it&#039;s over. There&#039;s nothing left but to just...relax. Decompress. To be yourself. To do whatever you want.It&#039;s such a funny feeling. You spent your whole life chasing after one goal, one dream, that you lose track of what to do after it. Maybe that Stille Dag CEO was right on some level - You don&#039;t know what you&#039;ll do without a threat to chase. You always did think in the back of your head that you picked the Cleaner job because...you needed the excitement. To show the world that you&#039;re willing to fight for your life. To leave some sort of impact.You suppose you did leave an impact. Far, far more of an impact than you expected.Frank mutters something under his breath, &quot;Let&#039;s go inside. The others are waiting.&quot;You would snark at him at his stiff attempt at being cordial but, nah, you don&#039;t feel like doing it.You&#039;re just glad that you have a FAMILY-.You&#039;re just glad you have a family that you can love. That you have people who love you. That worry about you. The two of you get off the ground. You suppose it&#039;s time to embrace the new chapter of your life, huh?God knows what&#039;ll happen once this is all said and done.You follow Frank back to the cabin. If what he said was true, Benedict is making a pretty sweet roast from a deer they hunted out here. You can&#039;t help but to laugh at the morbid joke. You suppose that&#039;s just how Cityslickers bond.------Seven months has passed.Wow, yeah, time flew by in a blur. Not because nothing happened but because, well, you just haven&#039;t felt an urge to monologue and to record every last thing that happened in your life. Not after you retired as a Cleaner. No point doing odd jobs and you&#039;ll explain why very, very soon.Things have changed a lot over the few months. You try to take a moment to think about all of the big examples.Well, first thing first, there&#039;s one brand new CEO and one CEO in training. Alexis Morozov has been solidified as the K-Corp CEO for a while now and, from what you heard, she&#039;s been doing a pretty decent job at running the Company. Things were shaky at first due to the impromptu coup of the former CEO, of course."

        "text": "She has managed to keep K-Corp in a stable (and profitable) state over the last few months.Casey, from what you&#039;ve heard, has been under the tutelage of the F-Corp CEO due to her ties to some other meat-based company back in her original City. F-Corp has been offering a brand new type of Drone specifically for restaurant and other adjacent service industries. You saw a few of them when you ate out at a F-Corp fast food joint and while they don&#039;t look like Casey anymore, they all have that same glossy look in their eyes she used to have.Clover, Ashley, Adam and Benedict are now household names across P and M-Corp&#039;s districts after your little investment. It&#039;s not rare to find someone listening to some song with a bizarre name like &quot;THE BURGLER FUCKED MY MOM IN FRONT OF MY FACE???&quot; that her band spat out. Hell, last you checked, Lex is working with them now. Clover&#039;s casino (well, it&#039;s more aptly described as an arcade now) has spread across various districts as a whole franchise now! A lot of the new ones are, admittedly, not as charming as the original but they still have that old western charm. You&#039;re just glad to see people enjoying themselves, frankly.Adam and Benedict are now running at least ten different five star restaurants across F-Corp&#039;s district. Due to Benedict&#039;s unique anomalous powers and Adam&#039;s god-like cooking skills, they are now some of the most revered names in fine dining. They gave you some quintupled smoked pig roast meat and, fuck, it was like heaven in your mouth. While they got some decent cash thanks to their new found popularity, you uh, you have too much to be frank.Turns out a lot of people invested into G-Corp after they saw what happened back at the old Head Meeting. Stock used to be $500 has now jumped up to match the price of other major corporate stock (like P and X-Corp), now it&#039;s at $2000 per share? Your extra investment in G-Corp (you did invest more into it when you could smell how quickly the stock was going to jump) and the businesses of your allies have given you a total net worth of around $17.5 million.It&#039;s really fucking bizarre to think about but Alexis probably has a network in the billions so! Hey, having a friend THAT high up in the corporate ladder does offer you a lot of benefits. God knows you needed the free security upgrade after paparazzi kept hounding you long after the Head Meeting.You also managed to get a lot of tech from the few (findable) Stille Dag bases scattered throughout the City. So, so many schematics and leftover tech ranging from invisibility cloaks to near-undetectable hidden cameras to full blown amnestics are all in the palm of your hand.You&#039;ll probably sell the rights to the tech back to K-Corp and D-Corp to see what they can make of it. With a lot of their tech now stolen and ready to be studied, the Stille Dag will probably be burning a lot of time trying to make new tech to bother the City with.And as for the SHIFTer research?"

Most people in the City just do not have the willpower to handle that kind of power. Now? It only jumped up by 20%. Granted, it&#039;s still a sizable increase, but a possible City-altering event was delayed for a long LONG while by your investment. You feel the best about this, frankly. You really don&#039;t want anyone becoming what you could&#039;ve become.They also made sure to treat the various friendly anomalies you came across well. The mutated dog-like goo thing, the forgotten tar man, the magical girl, the spessman, etc etc. You&#039;re glad that those who were already too far gone are at least going to live a comfortable life.You try to think about how your other allies are doing...Maruyama and Kiara apparently work together at T-Corp detective agency. Something about Maruyama&#039;s powers being well suited to that type of thing? You&#039;re just glad they&#039;re happy.You haven&#039;t heard anything from Anderson since the log cabin. Last you heard, he signed up to work in a P-Company facility with Frank. He&#039;s probably the only ally you haven&#039;t seen since the HEAD MEETING.Naomi has been busy working with Alexis and Casey so they can become better CEOs. Turns out the CEOs felt like they should have a CEO killer under their employee. Last you heard, Benjamin and Max have long since retired from public and they&#039;re now busy doing cutesy couple shit. Benjamin&#039;s apparently on his way into being a high corporate administrator at Z-Corp while Max&#039;s family has gotten a LOT more influence due to her assistance during the CEO fight.Dasha have been working for W-Corp under Wendy&#039;s supervision. It&#039;s a simple life but she&#039;s happy. Wendy hasn&#039;t really talked to you after the &#039;nearly became an anomaly&#039; incident and you don&#039;t blame her.Otto signed dozens of licenses and contracts to sell your likeness to various companies. That&#039;s frankly where a lot of your new networth and passive income came from. You think you saw some cheesy A-Corp drama about your life. Apparently it&#039;s called &quot;The Cleaner of G-Corp&#039;s Quest&quot;. Fucking lame.Quentin apparently works under Z-Corp now alongside Benjamin. Due to you not having to use his revival BOON, they were able to reverse engineer his bioengineered DNA into something more kosher for the Head. It&#039;s minor but you heard a lot of good things about the products that came from it. Last you heard from Alexis, the Mother of a Thousand Legs said it was &#039;proud&#039; of him.And for Vincent?Last you heard, he settled down to do art and has tried his best to avoid getting too much attention thrown back upon him. You really don&#039;t blame him, though, you&#039;re just glad he still answers your calls.---You&#039;re wandering through the streets of G-Corp. The nipping, familiar cold hasn&#039;t changed a bit over the last six months. Yet, you can see something new in the eyes of everyone you pass by.Hope."

The concrete you&#039;re driving on is cracked, the building itself looks fifty years out of date, there&#039;s hardly anyone else here besides you.You suppose it&#039;s just going to be you and whoever the mystery caller is.The walk to the mall is a long, chilly one but you suppose it&#039;s nice to have some peace and quiet. It&#039;s still foreign to you even though your previous adventures might as well be ancient history by now.That and it spares you from the paparazzi who bother you about what G-Corp stock to invest in.Inside the mall isn&#039;t much better.

Having a clear head has made you really tense whenever you come across someone gibbering in tongues like you used to.You shrug, thanking her for the directions.The arcade might as well be an anomaly&#039;s domain with how bizarrely decorated it is. A schizophrenic patchwork of decorations made up of various &#039;fun&#039; themes are scattered along the walls. Cowboys, sci-fi, fantasy, you name it. A half remembered mishmash of an arcade. None of the machines are working. You continue to roam throughout the arcade until you find what you think you were sent here for. A single locked door that&#039;s nestled in between two blank grey arcade machines. A piece of paper with &#039;PERSPECTIVE&#039; scribbled on it is slapped on front of it.It doesn&#039;t take long for you to find where the key is. WHISPERS OF THE CITY made sure of that. The door opens up to reveal a blank, smooth wall. You&#039;re about to throw in the towel right then and there - This was a cruel joke at your expense.You rest your hand against the wall and, huh. It phases right through like the wall wasn&#039;t even there. Odd. You suppose this is some Y-Corp tech. A portal hidden by a paper thin illusion.

Humanity might as well be the only life in this universe (aside from anomalies but they represent humanity in their own way). You glance up into the cloudy black abyss. You once heard a factoid that all of the light shining from stars in the night sky are hundreds or thousands of years old. For all anyone knows, the stars that light came from could be long dead. Glimmering light that&#039;s a remnant of a grand, luminous ball of plasma.You suppose that&#039;s probably how you, a fellow Star (even if only of the City), will end up. Eventually, you&#039;ll die. People who knew you will join with you until you&#039;re just a part of City history. A notable figure in a dusty book thousands of pages long.Perhaps the world will stay changed after you&#039;re long gone. Perhaps everything resets to zero.

        "text": "“Snack?”Monotone though it may be, the sudden question rouses you from a stupor you didn’t know you were in! Jerking your head upright, you find yourself crunching along a frost-flaked path behind a familiar pair of yellow eyes…The ones currently keeping pace with you, however, dwarf Volka’s by a long shot! Morook, you mutter, surprising yourself with how sleepy you sound, b-beg your pardon, bud?Your answer comes in the form of a bouquet of unfamiliar aromas creeping into your nostrils: fresh-cut grass… pine nuts… and syrup?“We’ve been traveling for some time now,” Begins the Chytree in a warm, but matter-of-fact tone, “But there’s plenty of path between us and our destination. Better keep your strength up.”Right, you think as you graciously take the trail treat from Morook’s claw, THE FAR-THROW INN. One of your first stops upon arriving in Zoral, actually! Was pretty darn comfy aside from the surprise assassin attack.“I wonder how many bells they’ll have for us when we get there? Hoo HOO, I can hardly wait!”Oh, that’s where Tzah-Tzie went! Perched atop Volka’s ample shoulder like a bird on a branch, the spritely songstress provides your journey with some much-needed musical accompaniment. Noticing your gaze, she meets it with a cheeky smile and a wink that sets your heart aflutter… but only for a moment.You never thought you’d miss having Rezzie around, but you’d be lying if you said you didn’t miss the devious little devil. She knew where you were headed and had a penchant for tracking you down in the past, but even with those facts fresh in your mind and the reassurances TT gave you a few nights ago, you can’t help but worry about the haughty hellion.… and Liz... whoof.Though your mind is occupied to capacity, Morook’s guidance keeps you on what you assume is the optimal path… still, it isn’t long before the frost at your feet fades and you come to…&gt;A rushing waterfall with a pool at its base…&gt;The yawning mouth of a cave on the side of a hill…&gt;A sweet-scented grove in the middle of the woods…&gt;An abandoned hut next to a trickling brook…"

You’d like to say it’s gotten easier to traverse the darkness, but Morook, well… that guy’s on a whole other level!Speaking of, after tripping over a branch and tumbling halfway down the mountain like a loose rock, your stinging sinuses get some relief from the brisk, dry air when they’re instead met with…… sweetness. Pure, unadulterated sweetness! As you and your pals descend into a copse of thick vines and shrubs with leaves reaching high enough to poke Volka in the cheek, you can’t help but suck in a few hefty breaths of candy-flavored air… this… this smells NOTHING like where you grew up! Is… is this what those hippies mean by ‘Fresh Air’?“Intoxicating! Invigorating!” Purrs TT as she stretches out like a cat on Volka’s shoulder! “MmMM, imagine refining this into a perfume! I could BATHE in this stuff~” One of her lime-green eyes locks onto you twinkling with mischief! “Ant… crazy business idea-”“Kinda reminds ya’ of the baths, don’t it?” Smiles Volka, the Skog’s tail thumping happily behind her! “Oh, that reminds me, Mor–we all went to-”While the three of you bask in the ambrosia-scented air, Morook’s disco ball-sized eyes show little, if any, enthusiasm…… unless Morook is enthused? Man, these Chytree guys are so hard to read! You have no trouble telling when TT’s happy-… Err, anyways, the ranger cuts you all off with a sharp CLICK--one that stings your ears a bit, but does a good job of shutting you up! Before you can ask, you get a hushed, but curt answer:“Sweetrope Vines. Beasts steer clear of these groves for a reason. Tread lightly and we’ll be fine.”Your guide doesn’t have to tell you twice! Falling in behind him and Volka (and by extension TT), the latter’s claw resting on her blade slung over her back, you keep your ears peeled for any sign of movement amidst the tangled terraces surrounding you…The passage widens the further you travel… the saccharine scent growing stronger with each step you take. Emerging into a core of the copse, you nearly trip over Volka’s tail as the odor goes from pleasing to downright DIZZYING! Running face-first into the Skog’s hip, you barely have time to recover before Morook’s eyes start to flicker like strobe lights!“KNEEL! QUICK!”&gt;CONTD."

Good timing, too–your knee barely meets the plush, mossy ground before you hear it: the buzzing of gossamer wings emerging from the vines!Morook gets about a quarter of a word out of his mouth before the owner of the wings makes themselves known: their eyes watching you like a hawk as their mouth curls into a smile. Its owner can’t be much bigger than your palm, but you’ve been in Zoral long enough to identify what they are:A Veeti. Just like Lila the Lamplighter!“Well WELL~” Exclaims the interloper, her voice creaking like a rusty door hinge as she flutters over to examine you, “Visitors!” Her gaze travels down to stare at your kneeling forms. “And polite, to boot! Very interesting…”Hovering around you and your friends, the owner of the arbor quickly grows impatient with your deference.“... You’re going to sprout roots if you stay like that all day, y’know. Come now, what brings you to my humble grove, hmmm?”You manage to glance over at Morook for about half a second before your gracious(?) host buzzes between you with a wry grin on her face!“Oho… you seem interesting! Well, dear? What are you doing here, hm?”Her tone doesn’t seem threatening… not yet, at least, but the significance of Morook telling you to kneel isn’t lost on you…What say ye?&gt;Just passing through!&gt;Let Morook handle this!&gt;You’re heading to the Far-Throw Inn…&gt;Foraging!

Gulping down those fond mamm-err, MEMORIES, you glance over at a very… well, neutral-looking Morook, if you’re honest! You’re gonna have to come up with a signal or something.H-he can-The words barely leave your lips before a sensation takes hold of your head and jerks it towards the Veeti’s scowling mug! Holding you in place like an invisible vise-grip, the same force pries your mouth open and limbers up your tongue! H-hey!“I am speaking to you.” States the winged witch as her alien eyes bore deep into your own, “Answer me.”Each syllable trembles with a faint echo like someone slowly turning up a microphone’s volume! Her words don’t carry malice, but a primal fear hatches in your gut as she stares you down… one that tells you this creature is not to be trifled with!“Forgive my interruption-”A trio of gasps escape you, TT’s, and Volka’s lips as Morook’s body ragdolls across the grove, landing in a heap on the other side! “He…” The Chytree groans, not bothering to regain his footing, “He’s not from this world… and doesn’t know… ngh… The Mossy Manner…”The Veeti’s gaze softens as you feel the unseen grip on your head slacken, if only just a little bit.“‘Zat right?” Her gossamer wings buzz as she circles your head, her tiny claws gently examining your features. “My my~ Put that away, pup.”You hear the faint ‘shhck’ as a very-embarrassed TT returns her blade to its sheathe.“That’s better.” Finishing her investigation with an approving nod, the Veeti hovers away from you and over to the center of the grove. “You may rise.”So you do! Nifty powers! Trying your best to brush the dirt and sap off of your robes, you indulge in an inward sigh of relief as Morook steps forward to take the lead!&gt;CONTD."

We’re head-”“To an Inn,” Interrupts Morook with a slightly more pointed voice than usual, “And we wouldn’t want to take up any more of your valuable time, so-”“Pah. Inns…” The pixie-like proprietor grumbles, “CITIES! What’s the point of ‘em anyhow?! Too loud! Too crowded!

Take care out there~”With musical accompaniment by Tzah-Tzie, the four of you tromp off into the forest surrounding the grove…&gt;Roll me 1d100+8 (+5 Morook Leads The Way, +2 TT Tunes, +4 Chytree Magic Sense, -1 Dark, -2 Small Plant…) to find the plant with few issues!

Magic Forests! Gosh!”“Sure doesn’t feel magic…” Grumbles TT as she tries to thumb a few more notes before climbing onto your back. “Now a real forest Veeti… THAT’S interesting!”Stumbling over a root, you grimace as TT’s claws dig into your shoulders! Is that weird?“It’s not un-weird…” Sniffs the Durher, her bushy tail tickling your elbow. “Veeti aren’t really fans of the urban lifestyle…”Yea, you scoff, you noticed!“It’s more than just preference,” Adds Morook as his eyes light up, “The Veeti are one of Zoral’s older races, Anton… well, older and still alive, I should say.”Older than Chytree? And Skogs? And Durhers?“Mhm!” He replies with a sagely nod! “Like Zetsi, their ancestral homes lie deep in the forests and jungles… but while Zetsi are more adaptable, Veeti, well…” The Chytree clicks as he struggles to put out an answer. “It hurts Veeti to be separated from the wilds. Biologically.”Right, you nod, Volka’s pal Lila didn’t seem very comfortable-“Lila?” The ranger interrupts, his eyes glowing brighter than a pair of headlights, “Yes, yes… Volka’s friend… you’ve met…” His high-beams glance over to his adoptive sister. “... did she ask about me while I was… indesposed?”A rare sly look worms its way onto Volka’s face. “Hmmm… nope, can’t seem to remember anything, Mor~”A dull click leaves the ranger’s lips(?). “Strange. Is your memory okay? I distinctly remember the conversation we had a few days ago when we discovered Anton here-”Darting over to cover Morook’s mouth faster than you’ve ever seen her move, Volka forces out a laugh as she sends a bashful smile in your direction!“Y-you know… s-she MIGHT’VE asked how you were doing!

Some plants ooze with sap that leaves your hands tingly–others retract at your touch. One plant, however, has rigid spears for leaves and grows almost up to your waist! Sensing you’ve found something, Morook comes striding over and nods!“That’s the one… careful on the edges-”Too late! As your hands close around the plant, you hiss in pain as you cut your hands on the sharp leaves! Bladespring indeed! “Uh oh,” Remarks TT as you pluck a plant from the earth and deposit it in your pocket, “Did it getcha?”“Don’t worry, Anton… it’s not venomous.” Explains Morook as he gets to work cleaning your palms with a cloth, “Those leaves can cut deep, however, so take care.”Thanks for the warning, you grunt, pressing the cloth against your fresh wounds.“No trouble at all!”With your quest more or less completed, you and the gang turn to head back the way you came… but as you retrace your steps, you can’t help but notice how cold the air’s gotten…“Took longer than expected…” Frowns Volka, her thick tail clearing a path behind her, “It’ll be dark soon.”“Hey, small price to pay for an easy reward, right?” Counters Tzah-Tzie with a toothy grin! “Say, Ant: see if she’ll whip up some perfume for us, will ya?” Why, so she can bathe in it?“I was gonna suggest selling it, buuuuuut you DO make a compelling argument~” She purrs, making a show of rubbing her chin in mock contemplation. “I certainly wouldn’t refuse such a thoughtful and VERY cute gift like that~”“Less talking, more walking.” Grumbles Morook, the Chytree already well ahead of the rest of the gang! “We’ll want to set up camp before it gets too late…”&gt;Roll me 1d100+8 (+5 Morook Leads The Way, +4 Chytree Magic Sense, -1 Dark) to get back safe!

A little favor for a memory or two?” Another derisive laugh wriggles free from his non-existent lips. “Or would I be more convincing if I looked something… like this?”Disappearing in a puff of cigar smoke, you blink in confusion when in place of the cowpoke you come face to face with…M-Mieslee?“Really, kid, seeing you trust everyone else so easily is… well it’s disheartening, to say the least…”Another poof later and you’re met with a familiar set of lime-green eyes and a smug, toothy grin!“... or am I just not tugging on the right… chains?”TT disappears into another cloud of smoke… and out from the gloom comes a pair of shades you’d recognize anywhere!“Ever get the feeling you’re making the wrong choices, pard?” Liz sneers! “Not everyone’s gonna give you a third or seventh chance, y’know…”RED’s final trick sends you stumbling to your knees… past the roaring hellfire you see her: the silhouette of her ponytail just out of reach…“We can’t undo the past, Anton,” the devil continues in a warm, reassuring voice you haven’t heard in years, “But we can learn from it…”What do you WANT, you roar as you stumble back onto your feet! Quit messing around and spit it out!A polite giggle rises above the flames. “What did that hag in the grove say again? ‘Something for Something…’”&gt;CONTD."

You hate to admit it, but he DID give you your powers, and based on your previous experiences with the guy there’s not much keeping him from taking over while you sleep and fileting your friends like trout!That doesn’t mean he WON’T ever do that, but… but if he can help you with your memories, well…Steadying yourself with a deep breath, your eyes meet with where you assume RED’s are… and you nod.Okay, RED, you mutter, you’re in.For a moment, all is quiet… deathly so. Even the roaring hellfire seems to grow silent as the hat-clad hellion regards you for the longest moment you’ve ever felt…And then he laughs.Laughs so hard it manages to echo in your weird slice of dreamworld. Laughs so hard his towering form nearly topples onto you like a redwood!“YESSSSS!” He shouts as the flames roar back to life with renewed vigor, “THAT is what I like to hear, Anton! Two mad bastards raisin’ Hell! Shaking the very foundations of Heaven itself! A pair-a outlaws on a midnight ride!”Snatching you into one of his colossal hands, RED makes a sweeping gesture at the lake of fire spreading into infinity around you!“You won’t regret this, son…. You and me? We’re gonna make a few changes in Zoral!”Yea, well, you stammer, still a little queasy from being picked up so suddenly, would he mind waiting a little longer? Like until you get back to town? He can have his pick of those Spice Cartel prick-“Mob goons? Oh no, no, no, Anton…” The devil laughs, the sound rumbling across the hellscape like rolling thunder, “We’re gonna aim a little higher on the bounty board than a few bootleggers…”You knew it. You KNEW he’d pull something like this! Every drop of enthusiasm leaves your body as you cast a steely gaze on your would-be ‘partner’. WHO, RED?!Even without a face you can sense the smile in his voice. “FOUR LORDS, Anton… Four immortal sovereigns the common folk get goosebumps just thinking about:WARLORD KHODRA: El Jefe de Skogs...TRIER: Ruler of that Umberal joint…SYSSKA THE DEVOURER: Scourge of the Western Wilds…And MIKK: The Southern Shadow…An unnerving creak emanates from RED’s neck as he cocks his head to the side. “We steal their souls, Anton, and we’ll be more than just a pair of handsome devils-turned liberators…” He brings his palm and, by extension you, close to his blank face.“We’ll be GODS!” Another raspy laugh leaves his unseen lips as he waits for your response.“How’s THAT for a plan?”It’s… it’s insane, you snarl! Stupid! Everyone speaks about those guys like they’re immortal! Hell, they might just BE immortal! And even if you WERE insane enough to go after one of them, how do you know he isn’t gonna fast-track you down to Chaa’tai!?&gt;CONTD."

If I wanted you dead I could’ve done it ages ago! I NEED agents in this pretty little world… I. NEED. YOU!”Gently scooting you over to the contract with his thumb, the devil gives you the short version while you read it yourself.“Track these fat cats down, Anton… get in close… and I’ll take care of the rest.”You blink in confusion as you near the end of the contract. Just like that, huh?“Just… like…. that.” Nods the cowpoke, “Sure, they sound tough… but I’m a little higher up on the ladder. Hell, imagine what the people will think of the lone gunman who takes ‘em all down, Tex!” RED’s belly rumbles with a sly laugh. “... Imagine all the things your fuzzy lil’ friend’ll wanna do when her boytoy becomes a LEGEND…”Okay, you groan, quietly imagining a few scenarios in your head, quit bringing up TT, alright?“While we’re on the subject,” The archdevil lets loose with a leopard-like growl! “Not a bad choice, son! I guess it’s true what they say: ‘Big things come in small packages’! And those hips-”MOVING ON! So if you sign this contract, you begin with a sigh, he agrees to NOT pull a fast one on you? Seriously?“I’m not your enemy, Tex… never was.” RED shrugs. “I’ve got an eye for people, y’know… and I think you’re capable of big, BIG things.”Before you can protest, two things appear in your hands: a fancy ink pen in one, a thick, pungent cigar in the other!“And if this plan sprouts wings, well…” The tip of your cigar topples off RED’s hand and into the flames below. “You stand to gain quite a bit, amigo....”Weighing your options and the items in your hands, you turn to face RED with a sheepish grin. If… if you do this… could… Could you get a cool hat too? The devil weighs your words for a moment, clearly not sure if you’re joking or not, but a moment later he erupts in another round of boisterous laughter that would give Volka a run for her money!“What the Hell kinda’ question is that, kid? I’ll give ya’ one right now!” Another poof of flames above your head is followed by something leather landing on your dome! “Call ‘er an investment… oh, and don’t worry–it’ll be there when ya’ wake up! Scout’s Honor!”You stand above a precipice… both figurative and literal! As far as you’re aware, the contract’s legit… especially the part stating that RED will take care of you until the lords are gone…All that’s left, it seems, is to make your decision.&gt;Sign the contract.&gt;Refuse the contract.&gt;Ask a question about the agreement!&gt;Alter the deal!&gt;Write-In!"

Archdevil RED reserves the right to take control if Anton is in immediate danger and risks endangering the completion of this contract.b) To best facilitate this transfer, Archdevil RED pledges to do all necessary to preserve Anton&#039;s life when preparing to extract the soul of one or more lords. If the transfer will jeopardize Anton&#039;s life, Archdevil RED will enact countermeasures to keep Anton safe. This contract is rendered void if, despite Archdevil RED&#039;S actions, Anton is still rendered dead, dismembered, and/or mentally-incapacitated enough to render the transfer of souls impossible. c) Upon fulfillment of this contract (Read: All four souls are transferred via Anton and Archdevil RED&#039;s cooperation), Archdevil RED will restore Anton&#039;s missing memories to completion. d) Archdevil RED agrees to Anton employing and cooperating with other allies. However, the agreed-upon award of memories is limited to Anton and Anton alone. All other allies must negotiate and agree to separate contracts with Archdevil RED if they seek rewards and/or compensation.e) This contract is rendered void if one or more aforementioned Lords die, are killed by another party, escape to another plane, or through inaction of Anton make it impossible to transfer their souls. f) Anton agrees to fulfill the obligations of this contract in a year&#039;s time.

Ending the discussion with a ‘what-can-ya-do?’ shrug, the Skog picks you up by the scruff of your robe and prepares to fire!“Hey, didja’ get a new hat?” She asks, earning TT’s attention as well as she gives your new accessory a poke! “Niiiiice material!”Yea, you’ll… you’ll talk about it in a bit, okay?

It’s a bit jarring at first, but before long the two of you work your way into a rhythm that continues until the crowd by the bar thins out dramatically!“Hmm…” Grumbles the barkeep as he hands off a fresh batch of beverages to the waitress, “Not bad.”High praise indeed… putting the rag back on the counter, you divert your attention back to the Innkeeper.

I HOPE he’s in town!” Needo sneers as he guzzles his drink! “Cuz’ if I find dat’ sneaky scumhead-”“LATER!” With his goons officially silenced, Lido scoops something jingly out of his pocket and tosses it over to you. “Spice N’ Sundries Incorporated wishes ya’ all the best in your future endeavors.” A metal card slaps the counter in front of you. “Reach out by post if ya’ hear anything… or wanna talk business!”With that the Spicys depart towards a quieter end of the tavern… leaving you and Inngo alone with the few patrons that work up the courage to order again!“Well-handled.” Grunts the barkeep as you try your best to help him, “Nothin’ but trouble, those lot.”Yea, you mutter, you uh… you’re well-acquainted…&gt;CONTD."

Is… is she mad?Another dish clatters onto the counter.Yea, she’s mad… look, you begin, you’re pretty sure Inngo was joking about the whole ‘banning’ thing! A-and besides… You&#039;re the co-owner! You could totally unban her if y-Waiiiiit a second… the sides of your mouth curl into a mischievous smirk as an idea comes to mind… a devious, no-good, ANTONy idea!Say, you begin in a sultry tone as you saunter over to the dishDurher’s side, why’s a sweet little thing like her hidden away doing DISHES?The wooden stool creaks beneath TT’s feet as she splashes some water your way! “Alas! A loathsome BEAST sealed me away~” She sighs, “Content to deprive the world of my beauty… FOREVERMORE~”Okay, you groan, it’s not gonna be forev-ugh… look, you continue, as you gently wrap your arms around her petite waist, what if the beast-“LOATHSOME beast.”Right, you sigh, LOATHSOME beast made her a deal, hmm? The word ‘deal’ sends the Durher’s pointy ears a-flutter, but she’s quick to conceal her enthusiasm! Guess that’s your cue to continue?“... Proceed.”Atta’ girl. Well, you continue as you gently massage her hips, what if she could pay off her debt to the new owner… another way?TT cranes her neck back to get a good, hard stare into your eyes, her tail whipping back and forth like a medieval flail! EErr, you sputter, y-you know… if… she’s okay… with it?She stands there silently pouting for a moment as she weighs your words. “Anton...” She growls, “Are you… seriously... asking-”Y-you’re just playing, you sputter! You’ll totally get her off the hook, but you just thought-“You just thought!” She repeats, whirling around on her stool to meet you face-to-face, “You just thought!?”Retracting your hands so you can deflect whatever impending attack is coming, your neck creaks like an old water pump as you nod your head up and down! Oh man… sometimes her bites hurt a lot...You’re about two seconds away from fleeing the scene screaming when the Durher explodes into LAUGHTER like a fuzzy, fun-sized IED--derisive, but genuine laughter!“Oh Ant… you… you…” She wheezes as she rocks back and forth on the stool, “You were gonna whore yourself out… for… for DISHES!”The sudden realization smacks you in the face like a dish rag! Hey, WHAT?! No, no, NO, you snarl, you were offering for HER to whore herself out! To get OUT of dishes!&gt;CONTD."

Carrying the doused Durher away from the death trap, you collapse into a nearby chair and squirm as she immediately straddles you!“My hero~” She purrs with a grin! “I oughta’ do dishes more often, huh?” Her claw barely misses stifling a snicker!

Did you tell Volka or Morook yet?

Calling upon your mighty SHORT-TERM MEMORY, you manage to weed out the wiseguys almost instantaneously from the crowd… though having a Skog and a shades-wearing Gnok helps quite a bit!LIMBOOOOOing through the crowded cantina like the champ you are, you manage to comfortably squeeze in behind a dozing Molegg… and right next to the sneaky Spicys!“I don’t think I get it, boss…” Mutters the Mzz’goe’virr with a defeated sigh.“I don’t think you get it either,” Frowns Lido as he continues to sip the drink you poured him. “Peepers?”“It’s simple, Muuzi:” Peepers recites like a student giving a presentation, “If dis’ Anton guy heads North, he’ll be picked up long before he reaches Umberal! East? Skog chow before he even hits da’ border!” Peepers awkwardly thumbs his shades. “Errr, no offense, Biiba.”The group’s resident Skog nods as he sips daintily on his alcohol-free drink. Hey… where’d he find a STRAW?!&gt;CONTD."

Verily.” Nods the terse Templar! “Indeed, the game is still afoot… and while I loathe to gossip, HIGH BELLCOUNTER IRYA is pulling her plumage out over the whole situation!” A sheepish grin slips onto the Skog’s face. “And, erm… is partly why I’m here before you know… in so many words.”“Hells, the head of the Bellcounters is stumped too?” Volka remarks, her eyes glowing with barely-hidden delight! “Well hey, I run a merry band of folks devoted to keeping Crossroads safe-”“THE LAMPLIGHTERS?”&gt;CONTD."

You’ve heard!?”“Erm, well…” Jhairo smiles, “My brothers and I have interred quite a few of your members in the temple crematorium… B-BUT THE WORK THEY DO IS HIGHLY APPRECIATED!” He stammers just as grapefruit-sized tears start to well up in the poor girl’s eyes! “Who’s going to replace Fellick anyways?” Asks Morook as he gives his sister a few reassuring pats on the elbow.“Ah. Another snag…” Scoffs the Skog, his tail flicking behind him in annoyance! “You see, the three top candidates: ZIST, KUBRI, and GHIRA held a memorial on a yacht in Fellick’s memory… and I TRULY shouldn’t be speaking about this, but…” His blue eyes GLEAM as he leans in conspiratorially! “There was an ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT! On all three!”Now it’s time for you to be shocked–you must have missed the yacht party! And the assassination attempt! Was this around your spa day, or-“No kidding! When did it happen!?” Asks Volka, the girl completely enraptured in the conversation!“The day after that explosion in… euch… GOLD TOWN…” Groans the Templar!Oh yea, you nod, that was… that sounded gnarly...“Gnarly indeed…” Jhairo nods, “Yet the destruction of that Monument to Sin may hath saved our would-be Chairmen’s lives… ‘pon the Casino’s destruction, High Bellcounter Irya decreed she’d take no chances… and she doubled the yacht’s security!” Jhairo’s face turns serene as he closes his eyes and smiles. “Even in these dark times, Mitaar finds ways to shepherd us away from chaos…”Yea, you nod, totally…“Me too…”Say, you begin in a chipper tone as you give TT’s ears a few scritches, you actually caught a few details of the conversation those guys were having… Jhairo’s already-shiny eyes light up. “... Oh?”Yep, you add with an enthusiastic nod, they mentioned heading South to some town called… Rizzo?“RYTZO… The Templar mutters under his breath, “An intriguing destination to be sure…” His face scrunches up as he contemplates it further! “But why such a backwater burg, I wonder…”W-well, you stammer, genuinely surprised at how quickly he took your advice at face-value, you uh… you also heard there might be some kind of CULT meeting up there too…Of the DEMONIC variety…The word barely leaves your lips before Jhairo is halfway to the exit! Sneakily pumping your fist in victory, your victory is short-lived when he’s stopped dead in his tracks by a frantic ‘WAIT!’&gt;CONTD."

I could get used to that…”D’oh! With your devious plan thwarted, for the night at least, you let out a long sigh as the tavern Waitress hops at your side and slips a fresh mug of Ruuppaa into your hand!“Ever try Ruuppaa, Jhairo?” Asks Volka as a replacement beverage is slipped into her claw!“I erm… I don’t make a habit of drinking…” Stammers the Skog! “THE FIFTH SERMON OF MITAAR states that moderation-”“Then moderate!” Chirps the Skog as she turns to face the Waitress! “Make that a double on the Ruuppaas! Oh, and put ‘em on my tab.”“Sure thin, hon!” The Durher replies, no worse for wear even after being held at knifepoint a few minutes ago!“That’s… very generous…” Jhairo mutters! “Though I worry it might not be to my likin-”“Don’t worry–if you don’t finish it, she will.” Shrugs Morook as he takes a seat beside his sis. “Heeeyyy…” Volka grumbles with mock ire in her eyes! “S’true, though! I’ll be the first ta’ admit it~”“Me… t-too?” Asks Tzah-Tzie blearily.“Sure, you can order, hon!” Answers her fellow fuzzball! “And you too, Mr. Co-Owner!

E-er, h-hey-“Please accept mine sincerest apologies for intruding upon your gathering!” He exclaims, earning you a few sidelong glances from the other patrons, “T’was truly a pleasure to share a drink and a conversation with you, Brother Anton!”Brother? L-look, you stammer, trying your best to lower the grin working its way onto your face, you’re not going yet… you actually had a thing or two you wanted to ask him, if it’s alright, that is!Jhairo answers with a hearty laugh as he gives your hand another shake that sends a painful shockwave through your body! “Mine friend, consider me an open book! HA! Get it!?”“Wha….? Oh! OOOOOOH!” Giggles Volka when she finally deciphers the joke! “Hahaha! Didja’ hear that, Ant?”“Heeer whuh?”She was talking to you, TT, you mutter under your breath as you struggle to keep the Durher from wriggling inside your robe! As for your question, well… You almost feel guilty interrupting Volka and Jhairo’s conversation–you’re no expert, of course, but you genuinely can’t tell if there’s a spark there or not… or if they’re both just starved of similar-minded Skog peers. In any case, you decide to make it quick:What ask? (Pick 1 to be polite!)&gt;Why did you join the Mitaaran Temple?&gt;Heard anything about devils lately?&gt;What do you know about Umberal?&gt;What happened, anyways? Why are you all the way out here?&gt;Why do you still serve Mitaar if, y’know, there isn’t any light?&gt;Whatcha’ think of Volka, huh?&gt;Would you wanna travel with us for a bit? We’re heading North tomorrow.&gt;Err, nevermind!&gt;Write-In!"

At the mention of the ‘D Word’, Jhairo perks up like a dog that just heard someone touch the kibble bag!“A worthy question indeed… and regrettably a common one!” Sighs the Templar with a shake of his head! “Ordinarily I wouldn’t dare worry you, friends, but in truth there hath been developments in that regard…”“D’aAAawwWwwIginndamIshREzzshiee..”The Templar puts his answer on hold to shoot ‘Miitu’ a look of genuine concern. “Hm?”She’s uh… she’s just drunk, you laugh, trying to act natural as you fail to keep the sloshed Spinner from climbing through your collar and into your robes! D-demons! What about ‘em!?“Well…” Jhairo continues, “In truth, and I urge thee to keep this knowledge close to thine bosoms,” Casting a conspiratorial glance around the busy tavern, the Skog does his best to crouch down and become inconspicuous before continuing. It goes about as well as hiding a T-Rex in a Kindergarten.“Devilry IS afoot, my friends… and steel yourselves well: mine Brothers and I caught one less than a week ago!”Let me guess, you reply, doing your best to ignore TT making a nest beneath your robe, they escaped?Jhairo’s HUNKY blue eyes shrink to pinpricks as he stammers a response that could give Flustered Volka a run for her money! “Y-y-y-well, that, erm… m-may very well be… POSSIBLE, that is!”How?The Templar now resembles a kid that got caught hitting a baseball through a window. “W-well I can assure thee it had nothing to do with the skills, or lack thereof, of the Mitaaran Templars…” Gulping down a lump forming in his throat, the Skog gives you all a weak smile. “Or the power of our Chanter’s Divine Wards and Seals…”“Then… what happened?” Asks Volka, the girl now totally enraptured!“The demon took advantage of a… weakness… in the Temple’s architecture…” He mutters, as if whatever helped Rezzie escape was his fault and his alone, “I can’t say more than that. What’s far more chilling, however, is that the foul wretches that summoned the hellspawn were never located!”“Actually, we just c-”“WHOOPS! STUPID TAIL! HOW SILLY OF ME~”It’s a wonder Morook wasn’t launched into the stratosphere by Volka’s surprise attack, and while the patrons at the table he flew into aren’t too pleased, Jhairo isn’t distracted!&gt;CONTD."

Sure, he’s a lot more agreeable when he isn’t melting your ears with his constant shouting and ‘Ye Olden Yore’ language, but you doubt he’d be as civil if he connected the dots about your little field trip to the crime scene or your demonic pals!And yet… he’s been really friendly tonight. To you, to your pals–the jury’s still out on TT– and to Volka, the girl still watching things unfold with concern in her eyes.A part of you almost enjoys seeing this knight in shining armor knocked off his proverbial ‘steed’... but another part can see the quiet pain behind his expression… and the plea beneath his blue eyes.You aren’t sure if it’s anything big, you begin in a measured tone, making sure to keep your voice down amidst the sea of tavern patrons, but while you were foraging with Morook around Crossroads you, well… found this.OW!Despite TT mounting a bold assault of nips and a few sensual licks on your hand, you manage to fish some of the BURNT PARCHMENT you pilfered from the Ritual Site you arrived in out of your pocket! You’re no expert on the subject, you add as you hand the document over to Jhairo for perusal, but some other documents mentioned a CULT OF THE BURROWER? And a… LORD LARIUS?For a moment you can almost swear the tavern goes silent as the name leaves your lips. Before you can ponder it at length, however, you feel a massive claw grab you by the collar!“This…” Jhairo stammers, “This is… wh-where did you find this!?”Seeing Volka’s mouth open to answer, you swiftly respond with a half-truth: there were some ruins, you mutter! A few days to the South!“WHICH RUINS!?” He hisses through clenched teeth as he pulls you closer to his face!You almost let it slip, but remember Liz and Rezzie! If he runs into either of them…! Th-they were… near the road, you gasp! O-on the way to RYTZO!Rising to his feet with you in tow, Jhairo’s gentle eyes dilate like a shark’s as his clenched teeth begin to tremble! Morook and Volka shoot each other worried glances as the activity in the bar skids to a screeching halt! All eyes are on you now, even Inngo’s–the gruff innkeeper two seconds away from leaping the bar from the look in his gaze! “This…” Growls Jhairo, the Templar lifting you even higher, “This is…”&quot;SoOoo hIiiiighhh... heheh~&quot;NOT NOW, TT!&gt;CONTD."

Skidding to a halt in front of a suitable table, you quickly reconsider when a Molegg borrows it to swing around like a club! Plan B! Ducking under the table thrown by a patron who had a similar idea, you eventually find a table next to a pack of Durhers biting and wrestling each other on the floor. This one oughta’ be safe!Hopping onto the table and clearing it of mugs and other obstructions, you reach into your robes and grab-“Anton~”Whoops, wrong thing! Fishing around some more, you retrieve one of the WANDS you ‘borrowed’ from the Spice Cartel during your casino escape! Great timing, too–even with the darkness you can tell the whole bar’s in on the action by now! Whipping out your… heheh… wand, you prepare to shut the party down… by any means necessary!Taking aim at your co-owned ceiling, you grit your teeth and try not to imagine how much repairs are gonna cost before letting ‘er RIP!To say your plan works would be an understatement! Sending a thundercrack tearing through the smackdown symphony around you, the wand’s magical payload blasts through the roof and showers you in charred roof debris!Frozen in utter shock, the bar’s patrons, you friends included, all turn to face you! Okay, you sigh, you know everyone’s got a lot of pent-up energy-“EEEEEY!” Shouts a Chytree currently wringing a Gnok’s neck, “HE’S GOT A WAND!”“HE DONE BE TRYIN’ TA’ TURN THIS HERE TAVERN BRAWL ALL VIOLENT-LIKE!” Adds a Skog pinned down by a pack of Durhers!“GET DA’ WAAAAAAND!” Snarls one of the Durhers!“AND GIT IM!” Shouts a One-Eyed Mox! “’E WANTS TA’ BLAST US, DUZEE!? WELL I SAYS WE BLAST ‘IM!”The crowd erupts in murmurs of assent as they come together in a beautiful display of community and brotherly love! The Good News: You stopped the brawl!The Bad News: You’ve unified the brawlers against a common enemy: YOU.https://youtu.be/wiX8CJqt3FcStill standing on the table, you feel your favorite fuzzball stir in your robe!“MmmMmMm…” Tzah-Tzie purrs as she pokes her head out of your collar and rubs her eyes, “That nap really hit the spot… whad’ I miss, Ant?”&gt;Roll 1d100+3 (+2 Loose Footwork, +2 LIMBOOO, +2 Illusionist Initiate, +4 Friend Backup, -2 TT GET OUT OF MY DAMN ROBES, -5 A BUTTLOAD OF AGGRO) to not immediately get clobbered!

Pirouetting out of the way, your eyes go wide as you the table lurches beneath the spry Skog’s weight… and, by association, you!The effect is obvious, if not a bit cartoony: Though the attack misses, the table launches you ceilingward like a seesaw through a hail of glassware! It stings a bit, but the beam you SLAM into at terminal velocity hurts a bit more! Clinging to the support like a squirrel about to fall from a power line, you nearly lose your grip when your robe’s petite passenger takes the opportunity to use your face as a stepping stool and climb onto the beam ahead of you!“Wh-what happened, Ant!?” Stammers Tzah-Tzie as the crowd below continues to hurl everything but the kitchen sink your way! “Th-this isn’t about the salt I took, is it!?”Nah, you reply as the two of you scurry along the support, there was a bit of an altercation between Jhairo, Volka, and the bar patrons… and besides, her salt thing was ages ago!Right?TT pretends not to hear you as she stuffs a handful of something in her mouth and starts to crunch on it!RIIIIGHT!?“Spirit of Honesty: I totally borrowed another bag or two when I was pretending to do dishes.” She replies weakly! “Sorry…?”You’ll be mad at her later when you aren’t in danger of being stomped into a paste! Peering over the side, you manage to locate your pals relatively quickly–AFTER ducking a pair of Durhers someone catapulted your way, that is! While Volka and Jhairo seem to be handling themselves pretty well, Morook is…… Well, he’s not doing too badly for an unarmed and injured Chytree! Baiting attacks from the crowd, the dude ducks and weaves like a pro as he delivers decisive blows with what you assume is a chair leg! Still, he’s pretty far from the Skog Squad…As for Inngo, well, you LIMBOOO another flying patron only to realize they’re a Gnok, not a Durher! Glancing downwards, you watch in awe as, true to his word, the Molegg begins the methodical process of putting patrons through his wall!He must have a deal with a Carpenter or something…&gt;CONTD."

Their jeers and cheers fading into the distance, Inngo takes the opportunity to hurl a ball of brawlers through one of the many holes in the wall before turning to address the remaining patrons!“Anyone ELSE wanna fight?”The tavern is quiet as the grave-“Errr, not tryin’ ta’ stir nuffin’ up,” Squeaks a Durher as he shoots an uncertain glance at his fuzzy friend, “But if we DO wanna keep fighting can we jus’ take it outside?”The innkeeper lets the question simmer for a moment.“... Aye. Jus’ don’t muss up the inn.”High-fiving his fellow furball, the Durher and several other patrons vacate the premises as well, punctuating their exit with the sound of renewed combat outside! Wiping the sweat from your brow and the saliva from your hand, you hop down from the rafters and land next to your pals!Well, you sigh, that could have been worse, huh?“Huh?”“Who’re you?”Errr, you stammer, V-Volka?

I’d call this an improvement.”“All the same,” Replies the Templar with fresh trepidation in his tone, “A Templar of Mitaar brings order to chaos… not the opposite…”“Don’t beat yourself up over it,” Morook sniffs, “I threw the first punch. Not you.”“Nevertheless,” Jhairo sighs as he rises from his seat, “I think it’s time I was well on my way. My superiors will wish to hear the information you shared with me.” The Skog gives you a warm, if not somewhat apologetic smile. “I will not forget what you’ve done for me, Brother Anton… and neither will the Temple.”Rummaging around in a pouch tied around his waist, the Templar places a bauble in front of you–its close proximity making your eyes itch like an allergy! OW!“This is a MITAAR’S LIGHT,” He explains, not noticing your discomfort. “All Templars and laymen doth receive one… don it and it shall tremble in the vicinity of aberrations and demons!”Errr, thanks, you answer, trying your best not to whimper when the pendant burns your fingers, that’s… he didn’t have to do that!“The first of many gifts, my friend,” He answers as he gives your shoulder a reassuring shake! “May it safeguard thou and your allies in these dark times!”“How are you gonna get back into Crossroads?” TT asks as she prods at your new gift! “No one’s allowed in or out, right?”“For me they’ll make an exception,” Shrugs the Skog before a realization settles into his expression! “Say, dost thou wish to travel together? I can ensure thou art rewarded properly!”“Hey, great idea!” Volka remarks with a big smile! “Whaddaya think, Ant? We can check in on the gang AND get an escort!”“It’ll be nice to see home again…” Morook adds with a weary sigh! YYyyea, about that, you mutter under your breath, you’re… not heading to Crossroads. Not yet, actually.Volka blinks her big eyes in confusion. “We’re… not?”No, you reply with a contrite grin, you’re… you were planning on heading to Umberal, actually…If Volka’s upset, she doesn’t show it. “Oh!

Sure, it’s always nice to have your favorite HUGE GAL close at hand, especially when you’re on Spicy turf, but maybe a more delicate approach is needed here? With Rezzie MIA you might just be the stealthiest you’ve ever been!Then again, having someone to rein in your favorite feisty fuzzball can be pretty handy too... and you’d be lying if you said you wouldn’t miss having your Grand Marshall around!That said, maybe Volka could use some time to check in with her pals and family? Lord knows you haven’t always been the best company… and spending some time with a fellow Skog might be good for her, even if it is Jhairo…Only Volka knows what she truly wants… and she’s earned the right to decide for herself, hasn’t she?Do what you wanna do, Volka, you say, giving the girl a reassuring smile! You ain’t gonna judge her either way!“Agreed.” Morook adds with an approving nod, “Don’t worry, Volk, I’ll make sure everyone gets your messages.”“Ooh… w-well…” Stammers the Skog, clearly not expecting the question to be reflected her way, “Well, um…”Her tail slaps the ground as she takes a steadying breath! “I… think I’ll tag along with you two, if that’s alright…”“Why wouldn’t it be?” Asks TT, a touch of relief seeping into her smile! “What would we do without ya, Volkie?”“Get into trouble, probably!” She smiles back! “... well, more trouble than usual, in any case.”“Wow,” Morook remarks with a low chitter, “If I didn’t know any better, I’d think you two were making me jealous.”“S-sorry, Mor…” Stammers the Skog as she wraps the Chytree in a gentle hug, “I know we just linked up again, but-”“It’s fine, you big baby,” He interrupts with a cheeky glimmer in his eyes, “Just keep those two safe until I join you, okay?”His disco ball eyes turn their attention to you. “And you keep her out of trouble, okay?”Aye-aye, you salute! Feeling something cardlike fall into your hand, your eyes hop between the item and the Ranger!“The PLANT NOTES I was going to give to Jhairo.” He explains in a matter-of-fact tone! “I figure you could use them more than Jhairo–I’ll just teach him on the way to Crossroads.”Damn, you remark as you pocket the card, is… is there anything you can do for HIM? He’s been so darn nice every since-“Just take care of my sister, okay?” He interrupts as he gives your shoulder a gentle pat. “... And if you find some Manglesprout on the way to Umberal, well…” He shrugs. “I certainly wouldn’t say no to a few sprigs.”&gt;CONTD."

It’s more of a symbolic gesture than anything else given the size difference, but Volka gives you all a grateful smile before ducking outside!“What do you think, Mor?” Tzah-Tzie asks, studying his expression with a quizzical look in her eyes.“I think the more friends Volka makes, the better.” Her brother shrugs again. “And if they’re a Skog that isn’t just interested in drinking her under the table or wrestling her into a bed, well… all the better.”His gaze shifts over to you. “Anyone or anything in particular I should speak to or look out for in Crossroads?

Punctuating your suggestion with a weak shrug, you take a steadying breath as Morook’s eyes pulse in acknowledgement! “You must be worried sick about her.” He observes. “I’m sorry, Anton.”Y-yea, you nod, it’s a bummer… Seeing TT’s eyes bore holes into your face, you swiftly change the subject by clearing your throat! A-actually, you continue, you were hoping he could keep an eye out for Rezzie. Y’know-“The devil we traveled with?” The Ranger asks, cocking his head to the side. “You think she’ll return to the city?”“The only predictable thing about that one is that she’s UN predictable…” Groans TT. “She DID track us down pretty easily last time though, so…”Well she tracked you down pretty easily before, so who knows?

A day or two at the most.”As if on cue, the door opens and in slinks Volka–the girl looking like she just shoplifted!“VOLKIE!”“AAH!” She shrieks, taken completely off-guard by TT’s sudden salutation, “I-I mean… TT… eyyy.”“Lookit you with your paw caught in the pudding!” Snickers the Spinner, much to Volka’s chagrin and confusion! “Say your goodbyes?”“Y-you’re the one with her paw in the pudding…” Grumbles the gentle giant as her tail slaps the floor! “He’s ready when you are, Morook! He, um… Jhairo, that is…”“Then I suppose it’s time we were off…” The Chytree remarks as he gets up from his seat. “Oh, and you’ve heard it before, but be careful in Umberal… it’s a whole other beast entirely.”Leaving Volka with one last hug, Morook takes his leave through the door leaving you and the gals sitting in the comparatively much-quieter tavern!“So…” Volka mutters several silent minutes later, “Umberal, ey?”Yea, you nod, Umberal.For the first time in, well, ever, it’s hard to read the girl’s expression. “Gonna be a long trek… Might just hit the hay now, to be honest.”“You… okay, Volkie?” Asks TT as she gives the Skog’s arm a gentle pat.“Yea, just…” She replies, forcing a grin on her weary face, “Just tired, is all. Big day, y’know?”She’s not wrong, and something tells you tomorrow will be even BIGGER.

TT, this place might be totally dangerous-”“I know…” She sighs, meeting your gaze with a sheepish grin, “And I’m not a princess–if we don’t have time, we don’t have time… I just…” The girl pauses to adjust her legs. “I want to feel like a normal girl for once… and I wanna spend time with you, Anton. Couple time.” Her smile droops a bit as the words leave her lips. “... while I still can.”What’s that supposed to mean? You’re not dying any time soon, TT…“That’s what they all say…” She mutters with a grim look in her eyes before hastily putting on a smile! “A-anyways, just think about it, okay? A-am I crazy?

You coulda’ swore-Your question is put on hold as the Durher uses what little weight she has to shove you backwards onto the bed! “Speaking of ‘rides’...” She purrs, licking her lips as she straddles you and locks you in place beneath her, “I never got to reward you for getting us out of the Casino~”D-don’t mention it, you stammer, but-“Good boy, Anton~”It would seem the time for talk is over… Descending upon you like a sensual bird of prey, Tzah-Tzie doesn’t let you get much sleep… but by the time the faint sound of critters cheeping and wagon wheels turning slip in through the walls, you awaken with renewed pep in your step and vim in your smile!… what were you talking about last night? Eh. Doesn’t matter! Donning your clothes and making a vague attempt at de-messying your hair, you find your pals at the bar chatting over a plate of what smells like mushrooms and milk…“Mornin’, Rook!” Chirps Volka, the girl positively glowing as she gives the stool next to her a few smacks! “Sleep well?”Sure, you reply with a tired smile, it was nice to have a bed under your back again…“Ha! Tell me about it…” The Skog laughs as she shovels a spoonful of food into her mouth, “Rh shrebt rige a BULDR!”“Pleasant dreams of your new friend?” Inquires TT with the usual smugness. To her credit, Volka only spits a tiny bit of her food out!“C-come on….” She groans, wiping her lip with an embarrassed laugh, “I’m glad I got ta’ talk with another Skog, that’s all…” She shoots a sharp glance at the devious Durher. “Not everything’s about hanky-panky, y’know…”“What’s wrong with talking about it?” Asks the Spinner as she cocks her head to the side! “Bottle it all up and it’ll make your scales fall out, y’know~”Volka’s eyes nearly fall out of her skull! “W-wait, really!?”“Food’ll be ready in a bit, hon!” Giggles The Waitress as she darts past you behind the bar! “No charge–boss insists!”Peering over the counter towards Tzah-Tzie’s dish dungeon, your curiosity is rewarded with a heavenly, buttery aroma wafting out of the kitchen and into the tavern!&gt;CONTD."

For example:” Clearing her throat as she stands on her stool, the Spinner’s eyes fall upon you with a mischievous twinkle!“Spinners write song after song about the language of love... the pieces of passione... but y’know what really gets people going?” You and the Skog exchange a wary glance. No words need to be spoken, but you know that at a moment’s notice the two of you are ready to tackle the foul fuzzball to the floor.“Why, a little praise, of course!” The Durher continues! “Take Ant here: certainly not the toughest nut to crack… but if I shout his name or call him a ‘good boy’, he melts like-”GOOD NEWS, VOLKA, you scream, WE’RE GOING ON A TRAIN TODAY! ISN’T THAT NEAT AND A HUNDRED TIMES MORE INTERESTING?!“A… train?” The Skog blinks as a confused, but relieved expression forms on her face! “Oh! The Skyrail, y’mean?”That’s right, you nod, TT grabbed a pass off of those uh, Cartel guys last night! Does she know where people board?“Jus’ outside Crossroads off’a the main road.” Rumbles Inngo as he places a steaming dish of breakfast beneath your nostrils! “Road’s paved with that stuff they make in Umberal. Can’t miss it.”Just the guy you wanted to talk to! You have a question actu-wait a sec…The contents of your plate are creamy, but have a bit of a citrusy zest as well–you’ve got no clue whether you’re eating veggies, meat, or something in-between, but whatever the heck it is, it’s GREAT!MmmM! A-anywaysh, you continue, this is REAL good by the way… would he happen to have any disguises or costumes left here by his customers?You didn’t think it was possible for the Molegg’s stare to get any blanker, and yet here you are.“... Disguises?”Yea, you nod, y’know… to keep under the radar while you’re on the train!Still blank. “...What’s a ‘RADAR?’”&gt;Roll me 1d100 to see what he can scrounge up!

They’re still here!” Snickers the Skog as her tusks magically reappear! “TUSK WARMERS! Nifty, ey? Betcha didn&#039;t even recognize me, didja?

Moving at a glacial pace, the queue eventually takes you up an incline into some kind of station building–the air cool and echoey from the massive edifice surrounding you!“Hope we’re in the right line…” Grumbles Volka, the poor girl’s tail swishing as she rapidly loses patience, “Bet we coulda’ boarded by now…”&gt;CONTD."

All the same, it DOES look a bit less crowded…“My good man~”Purrs Tzah-Tzie as she takes a dramatic step closer, “What would one need to procure a spot in the ‘Resident’ line, hmm?”The guard gives the girl a long, hard, unflinching stare. “If you have to ask, you aren’t a resident.”Departing with purpose in his step, the guard leaves you and the gals to your own devices, TT looking especially miffed!“Don’t worry, T,” Smiles Volka as she gives her pint-sized pal a pat on the head, “I can still throw ya’ if ya’ like!”“It’s… not that…” The Durher growls–her fuzz bristling against your leg! Then uh… what is it?TT takes a few more whiffs of the air before nodding angrily. “No doubt about it… SHE’S here… somewhere…”Volka’s eyes widen. “Y-you don’t mean…?”“Mhm…” Hisses the Spinner, body trembling and eyes wide with unadulterated malice, “LUTZA!”Oh hey, you remark, you ran into her when you were escaping the casino! Maybe she could fast-track you onto the train! Or, you double-back after getting a look from TT that could turn a lesser man to stone, m-maybe n-not?“Hey, uh,” Stammers the Chytree behind you, “Is your pet okay?”“She’s fine!

Steeling yourself against the menacing miasma, you put on your best Customer Service Smile!Smoke break, huh? Bet he’s pretty hungry too…Your assumption earns a raised eyebrow from the Mizweed-smoking menace! “... Maybe I am, what’s it to ya?”Well, you continue, you happen to have some extra trail rations burning a hole in your pocket… and if someone were to assist you, well–“You think I’m an animal or somethin’?” The guard interjects with fresh disdain in his expression!… does he want the food or not?Taking a few more puffs of his smoke, the Gnok finally answers with a shrug. “Yea, sure… why not. Trail rations…” Retrieving the chow from your pocket, you hold it just out of reach as you match his sneer with one of your own as you hand over your pass! So, you cough as he looks it over, where should you be?“... There’s no way you’re a godsdamned Templar,” He begins, sending a chill down your spine! “... ya ain’t actin’ high and mighty enough.”Oh, uh… Mitaar says to, uh… be cool, you wheeze as you and Volka exchange a sneaky thumb’s up!“Huh. Guess I oughta’ go to temple more.” Handing your pass back, the guard’s eyes leap over to the shorter line. “You’re supposed to be over there, but I wouldn’t even bother waiting. Just talk to my buddy HUUT--the Mox.” Your eyes once again follow his to a frazzled-looking guard standing next to what you’re guessing is the end of the VIP line! “He’ll getcha’ on the train lickety-split.”Oh. Well, uh, you cough as you hand over the RATIONS, th-thanks!“For what?” The Gnok scoffs! “You see… you merely received information while I obtained material goods out of this transaction.” The guard nods to himself with a pleased-as-punch smirk. “Making ME the winner here. You’ve been bested.”… what the hell is wrong with y-“Thanks, mate! C’mon, Rook~” Volka chirps as she picks you up with the hand not currently holding a still-irate Tzah-Tzie by the scruff of her neck! Striding across the station with renewed purpose in her wide step, the Skog plants you both down in front of the aforementioned ‘HUUT’.“Three for the Skyrail, please and thank ya!” She announces with a fresh grin! “Your pal over there said you could fix us up! All aboaaaard!”The Mox examines your pass before looking you up and down like a coach sizing up a boxer. “... Sure, I can getcha’ on. Just promise you’ll never say ‘All Aboard’ again.”“This Skyrail Station’s a cold and unfriendly place, Rook…” Mutters Volka, her tail drooping along with her expression. “I don’t much care for it...”&gt;CONTD."

Guess that’s a yes? The commotion only grows louder as your destination, and as you emerge onto the main train platform, you can’t help but wonder how the hell you missed it!Sensing the question in your eyes, Huut delivers a response with almost impressive amounts of apathy in his tone! “Whole terminal and the connecting railways are subject to several concurrent spells–keeps things nice and quiet outside while also making it harder for the train itself to be detected.”Woah, you blink, so you’ll be riding, like, an INVISIBLE train?“Courtesy of TRIMBAULT ACADEMY.” He replies as he deposits you all in a fresh queue leading into the hissing train! “They’ll remind ya’ when ya’ get in, but don’t try anything stupid… Umberal folk ain’t too keen on giving second chances.”Thankfully the queue leading into the train moves MUCH faster than the one outside! Not that you notice much. Stepping into the train, you feel like you’ve entered a completely different world: one that greets you with the smell of a roaring fireplace and a cozy temperature to match! Before you can delve too deep, you’re stopped by an invisible hand pressed against your chest!“Greetings, Templar,” Purrs a pair of eyes shaded by what you assume is some kind of cowl, “We trust you’ll be choosing the private booth today?”Yes, you slowly nod, that will… that will suffice, you think! Mitaar always says-“The door to your booth will be attuned to your pass. Don’t lose it.” The mage’s eyes flicker to life with an uncanny glow! “The DINING CART will be to the right of your booth–the LEISURE CART will be to your left. Please relax.”A moment of pure, unadulterated NAUSEA washes over you–like a whole day of roller coasters jam-packed into one second–before you find yourself standing in…Well, you obviously can’t see it, but it seems like a room! Bumping into a plush, silky recliner behind you, you freeze up like a deer in the headlights as the gentle pluckings of a woodwind instrument pipe into the booth!“OoOugh…” Sputters Volka as the gentle giant tumbles into a chair of her own, “Hate teleporta-ooh, comfy!”You follow suit and sink into your own chair. That’s what that was?“Mhm!” The Skog purrs as she makes herself comfortable! “Y’see magic in Crossroads, but I guess it makes sense there’d be more of it up North… TRIMBAULT’S the place ta’ study magic at, after all!”What the hell are you getting yourself into? Relieving Volka of TT, you bring the frothing fuzzball over to your seat and sit her down in the recliner next to you like a kid in a car seat!Feeling better yet?&gt;CONTD."

FOOD!’ until the scent of said ‘FAN! CY! FOOD!’ assaults your nose and ears… and what an attack it IS!Fresh-baked pastries! Roasting herbs and spices! Hissing meat and bubbling stew! Bartenders shaking and pouring bubbly beverages! Cutlery and dishware clattering and clanking over the roar of hundreds of conversations! All this and more greets your senses like the overture to an orchestra performance… the calm before the tasty, TASTY storm!“It’s…” Mumbles Volka, the girl standing reverently as she observes the spectacle, “L-lovely…”Is she crying?“OUTTA’ THE WAY!” Snarls a Mox as he bodily SHOVES past you and your pals, “That’s a FIRE ‘AZARD, y’know!”&gt;CONTD."

Which,” She adds with renewed sugar in her smile, “Is pretty much impossible for Anton here, but that’s what makes him so dang endearing, doesn’t it?”“Y-yea! Totally!” Laughs Volka, her expression still laced with confusion! “S-so what is he um… euphemising anyways?”“Ain’t it obvious?” Mutters the musician with a hint of sympathy on her face! “Ant’s gotta’ use the privy, Volkie.”Both you and the Amazon straighten up like bamboo shoots–the latter’s eyes widening bigger than Morook’s!“That… that makes sense!” She exclaims! “You haven’t mentioned that since you got here, Rook! You must be dying!”Oh, well uh-“Go!

Making a show of sheepishly shuffling away, you turn back to your pals and tell them that if you’re not back in a bit, then-“Eeewwww! Gross, Rook!” Giggles Volka as she waves you away! “C’mooon!”“We’re not gonna check on you, you big baby!” Adds TT with a snicker of her own! “Just hurry up, okay?”Just… you shouldn’t take long, you whine, now convinced you’re gonna die because your friends want to respect your privacy! Pl-please…Your pleas only fuel the girl’s laughter. Hanging your head in resignation, you head off in the direction of what you assume is the room you were summoned to. 223, right?To your relief, it isn’t that far away! If you had to be paranoid, however, you’d say things are pretty quiet when you arrive… almost TOO quiet, in fact!

When it’s finally clear your life isn’t in danger, your brain finally catches up. Client?“Mhm!

Where are my manners?!” Lutza blinks, as if genuinely scandalized by her own behavior! “These three are Tiiro, Tiino, and Jopp, also known as The Tiito Triplets… my security detail.” The Skogs give you a rehearsed bow.“And this is my manager, Joplin.” The Durher adds as she glances over to the green-eyed Gnok with a loving grin! “Oh, what would I do without him…?”“You humble me, Miss Lutza.” He swiftly replies before turning his hawk-like gaze on you, “My apologies for the peculiar circumstances leading up to this meeting, Mr. Peas, but in truth every precaution was needed to make this meeting possible. You see…”He pauses, stealing a sidelong glance at his client, “Miss Lutza is in grave danger, and we humbly request your assistance in the matter.”Grave how, exactly, you ask, sitting up in your chair! Like… death stuff?“Precisely that.” Nods the manager as the security Skogs let their heads droop in grim reverence! “We have reason to believe that someone on this train intends to harm Miss Lutza… or worse.”You know someone who might fit the bill, but something tells you they aren’t talking about Tzah-Tzie. Okay, you frown, but why choose me?The question seeks to irk Joplin, but not enough for him to fully show it. “Indeed. My magical skills are considerable as you’ve already witnessed, and the Tiito Triplets are second-to-none in the realm of combat, but-”“But whoever’s stalking me isn’t dumb…” Whines Lutza as she cradles her face in between her claws! “They know to keep their distance, especially when Joplin is hanging back… but you!” Her eyes light up as the last word leaves her lips! “They don’t know you! You could get the drop on ‘em!”Sure, you smile weakly, but still… Why you? Why not some other schmuck? Lutza closes her amethyst eyes as a thoughtful expression forms on her face.“...

You just want the facts!“Miss Lutza has a fair share of detractors, it’s true…” Joplin sighs with a shake of his head. “Rival musicians, slavers, merchandise bootleggers… we pay The Triplets good bells for a reason.”“Sometimes fans get a little… clingy...” Mutters Lutza with a crooked smile, “Most of them are harmless, but this one…”“We have reason to believe they aren’t just another fan,” The manager concludes as his frown deepens. “First: they haven’t made an attempt to contact Miss Lutza.” He steals a concerned glance at the starlet. “Most of her more… passionate... fans have done so in the past.”“Ain’t nuffin’ right about it, treatin’ Miss Lutza like that!”“Spoils da’ fun fer’ everyone!”“Too right! She jus’ wants ta’ make people smile!”“Notes attached to rocks thrown on stage or through my window… messages carved into my door at the inn…” The Spinner sighs as she counts them off on her fingers, “Some of ‘em just run up and try to hug me! But whoever this is doesn’t want to make contact… and that’s what scares me the most.”“There’s one thing I know for certain:” Joplin adds in a hushed tone, “Whoever they are, they know their way around magic.”Pardon your skepticism, you retort, but how does he know that, exactly?“This isn’t your ordinary train,” The Gnok shrugs, his forest-green eyes sweeping around the booth you’re currently occupying, “Even without these new ‘Teksoul’ contraptions, every car is bathed in multiple top-level enchantments maintained by the conductors… Anti-scrying, noise-dampening, odor-subduing…” His frown deepens. “Not to mention the regular Spice Guild attendance… they take care of their investments.”He and his client share a knowing glance. Spice Guild. Right, that’s what they like to call themselves, don’t they? So, you huff as you mull over the details in your noggin, whoever’s stalking Lutza would have to be pretty skilled, huh?“‘Pretty Skilled’ is an understatement.” Mutters the manager! “This train is functionally undetectable when in motion, and the conductors are constantly sweeping for intruders and stowaways. Any and all unusual activities are logged.”So that’s why he was so cagey about contacting you, huh? The Gnok nods.&gt;CONTD."

Seems like a whole lotta’ hassle for just one sorcerer, doesn’t it?The Gnok answers with a sardonic laugh. “Indeed… which is why we’d like to know who’s backing them.”“There WAS that one businessman that approached me last time I performed in Umberal…” Muses Lutze, her tail thumping harder against the chair, “HOLIS MARSHE? He was pushy, but he wasn’t, well…”Pushy?“Yea…”You’re just spitballing here, you begin in a diplomatic tone, but has she considered… the Spicys?“Not exactly…” The musician replies with a sad smile. “I already have an… agreement… with them…”“A contract she signed long before I was in the picture…” Joplin frowns. “Magical, no less. My misgivings aside, the contract ensures no one from The Guild can harm Miss Lutza… directly or otherwise.”“Rolo wouldn’t let that happen even without the magic.”Your head tilts to the side. They can’t wiggle around that?“A magical contract is airtight,” The manager answers with a grim laugh, “As are the penalties if it’s violated. One of the main appeals, actually.”Right, you nod with a frown, so no Spicys and no small-time chumps. Meaning whoever’s doing this has an agenda and a group to back them up.“I didn’t say that…” Lutza squeaks as she shifts around uncomfortably in her chair! “It MIGHT be a Guild member going rogue… it might even be a really, really persistent fan, too…”“Plans have a habit of changing,” Joplin shrugs again, “But you need only concern yourself with learning more about the stalker’s identity. We will handle the rest once you ascertain who they are.”Easy for him to say, you scoff! What if this mage catches wind of you tailing him, huh? What if he turns you into salt, or something?“Unlikely, but…” The air seems to wrap around you as a series of hushed mutterings leave Joplin’s lips at a rapid-fire rate! “There,” he sighs as an uncanny glow fades from his eyes, “You’ll be partially-shielded from nastier spells for the next few hours.”Partially?“Were we not on the Skyrail I could do more,” Grumbles the mage, “But this should keep you safe during your investigation.”&gt;CONTD."

They’re uh… you pause, feeling a lump well up in your throat, passionate fans…“I’d prefer it, actually.” Says Joplin as he steals a glance at his client. “The less attention drawn to Miss Lutza’s presence the better, as far as I’m concerned.”“But they’re more than welcome to come to my concert when we get to Umberal! Backstage passes for everyone!” Smiles the Spinner before a sad thought sends her smile into a slump. “... assuming it still happens, that is…”The ordinarily-silent Triplets rush to the musician’s side like a pack of tusked nurses!“Don’t go sayin’ things like dat’, Miss Lutza!”“Yer’ fans NEED ya’ ta’ perform, Miss Lutza!”“Sure as da’ sun rises, Miss Lutza!”“You guyyyss...” The Spinner sniffs as her security detail escorts her tears off the premises with gentle claws, “What would I do without you all?

Such a shrewd negotiator~”Y-you’re a man of many talents, you laugh, praying to whoever’s listening that you don’t smell too much like the Spinner when you regroup with your pals!“That settles that then!” Lutza chirps as her security Skogs deposit her back into her chair! “Joplin, walk him through the plan, would you?”“Of course, Miss.” The Gnok nods respectfully. “The aim is to keep things simple: Miss Lutza shall proceed to the LEISURE CART escorted by security.”“Easier done’n said!”“Leave da’ worryin’ ta’ us!”“Ain’t no one gettin’ past me!”“Once there,” Joplin continues in a businesslike tone, “She shall begin an impromptu performance. I shall endeavor to make my presence known near the stage–with luck the stalker will assume I’m too preoccupied to be on the lookout.”“Oof… talk about stage fright…” The starlet stammers as an uneasy giggle leaves her pursed lips!“You’ll do fine, dear.” Clearing his throat, the manager turns his hawklike eyes over to you. “You’re probably wondering how you’ll be able to identify our man.”Yea, you nod, you didn’t really consider it until now-“Once her song is finished, Miss Lutza shall rush offstage sobbing.” A wry grin thaws Joplin’s stony expression. “Swiftly enough, in fact, that the daring Triplets will be unable to follow her.”The Skogs exchange a knowing chuckle. “That shall be your moment, Anton.” Explains the Gnok as he gives his claws a decisive clap! “Miss Lutza shall make a break for the back of the train for some fresh air. With luck it’ll be as simple as determining who rushes after her.”“Don’t worry–I’ll try not to run too fast!” Lutza adds with a wink! “Just promise me you’ll keep up, okay, Anton?”“The Triplets and I shall trail after you at a distance.” Joplin concludes. “Best case scenario, we’ll have the Conductors ready to apprehend the culprit long before anything goes amiss.”A-and the worst case?Joplin’s frown deepens. “... Then we shall join you in subduing the stalker.”Super… this’ll be fun to explain to your friends…“Any other questions? Time is of the essence.”Well…&gt;Let’s DO this!&gt;You wanna talk about someone named Tzah-Tzie first…&gt;I actually wanna back out…&gt;Let’s alter the plan a bit…&gt;Can you wait while you explain this to your pals?&gt;You wanna talk about something else… (Umberal?

Surely Joplin noticed.“I am aware, yes,” He nods stoically. God, what a PRO! “A Skog and a Durher-”Yea, the second one’s the issue, you interject with a nervous chuckle! See, her name’s ‘Tzah-Tzie’.You probably give Lutza and her staff a whole minute to stare awkwardly at you before you realize they aren’t gonna follow up. Erm, you continue, she’s a Durher Spinner too? Holds a bit of a grudge?You’re not sure which stumbled-over word did it, but one of them causes Lutza’s lavender eyes to pop out in recognition! “Oh… OH! Joplin, he’s talking about BAAELIS!”Great, another name for the bucket. Baaelis? Joplin’s steely gaze hops from you to his employer. “Miss?”“It’s okay, I can explain…” Sighs the Spinner as her tail gives her seat a resigned smack. “So she’s going by a new title these days, huh?”Y-yea, you nod, trying and probably failing to play along, and she’s not a Lutza fan, let me tell you…Well, VOLKA is, but-“Musta’ been a year ago…” Muses the musician as she wistfully gazes at the ceiling, “I was still fresh on the Spinner scene… still popular, mind, but not as popular, you know?”Sure, you nod, barely concealing your unfamiliarity with popularity, totally…“I had just finished playing a set in MIRAL at the CHIPPED TUSK TAVERN when I heard them:” The Spinner pauses as a warm smile sneaks onto her face! “Notes from a Striilii… clearer than crystal!”You blink. She… started playing?“It was divine...” Lutza nods, her smile full of whimsy as she relives the memory in her head! “And I just stood there stupified! I had been challenged a few times before, but-”Wait a sec… ‘challenged?’“A common occurrence in the Spinner world,” Shrugs Joplin. “A ‘stunt’ performed by lesser-known Spinners to gain renown.” His perpetual frown deepens. “Imprudent, but not prohibited. This was long before I represented Miss Lutza, mind. Such frivolities wouldn’t happen under my watch.”“Aww, but she was so cute though!” Chirps the Durher as she kicks her feet against her chair! So, you continue, what did she do about it?“What else? I accompanied her, of course! Once a melody gets going, well… I can’t help but sing along!”Hoo boy, you sigh, you know how this ends…“And, well… that just made her play more…” Continues Lutza, her smile dipping into sheepish territory! “And so did I… and eventually she sug-”&gt;Roll me 1d100 for reasons!

I’ve got them.” He mutters with a triumphant half-smirk! “It was only for a moment, but I was able to get something…”“W-well don’t leave us in suspense, Jo!” Pouts Lutza as her security Skogs rush over to the cabin door! “What’ja get!?”“To begin, they were just outside of this cabin-”“AFFER’ EM’!”“THEY AIN’T GONNA GO FAR!”“LEMME AT ‘EM!”“STOP.” Snarls the Gnok, freezing the Skogs in place, “Pursuing them now will give the game away… and allow them to pick their battlefield.”Lutza frowns. “They… didn’t sense you sensing them?” Her question earns another smirk from her manager.“You don’t employ a fool, my dear. I was very cautious.” Turning his stony gaze onto you, Joplin continues to relay what he unearthed: “They’re a Mzz’goe’virr–I’d recognize a lumbering gait like that anywhere. Nonetheless, they’re known to be adept assassins and mages…”“Some of my kindest fans are Mzz’goe’virrs though!” Lutza chirps with a fond smile! “This one guy gave me a doll he weaved… the proportions were way off, but-”Mzz’goe’virr, you mutter, got it… but what was she saying about Tzah-Tzie?“Oh,” Blinks the balladeer, “Well, um…” Reaching over the side of her seat, Lutza picks something up off the ground and lets it rest in her lap before giving it a few strums.You don’t know what angels sound like, but you’re pretty sure the notes that come out of the instrument come close…“Beautiful, huh?” Lutza sighs as sadness creeps into her eyes, “This… was hers-”“I hate to rush you both,” Joplin rushes, “But time is of the essence here. If we lose this Mage, they’ll be practically untraceable in Umberal.”Nodding hastily, the Spinner sends an apologetic smile your way! “Let’s finish this when you’re done, okay?” Hold on a sec, you frown, why doesn’t she just talk to TT with you?

Her manager offered us a job, you explain in the clearest and most diplomatic tone you can muster, to the tune of 3000 BELLS-The sum hits the Spinner like a bag of turnips. “That’s…” she stammers, her anger struggling not to crack under greed’s pressure, “N-no… that’s… it’s not…”And if we’re gonna talk about it more, we’re gonna have to do it in the cabin, okay? She can kill you there! The Durher’s mouth trembles as her shocked expression and wide eyes bore holes into yours!Tzah-Tzie’s claws pull out of your cheeks as the girl hangs her head.“....Fine.”The cabin feels colder when you enter it again–the easefloat and pheromones seem to have shut off automatically as well. Good thing, too–probably would have messed with the mood. Speaking of, Tzah-Tzie wastes no time in stomping over to a seat the minute the door opens, prompting you to take the one opposite her.“... 3000 Bells, huh?” Mutters the Durher as she stares ceilingward with utter contempt in her eyes! Yea, you nod as Volka quietly takes a seat next to you, she and her manager are pretty certain there’s a stalker on-board trying to ice her-TT interrupts your explanation with a derisive snort. “There’s an idea.”“Alright, that’s ENOUGH!”The sudden ire in Volka’s usually-gentle voice nearly sends both you AND TT bowling out of your seats! Rising to her full and VERY intimidating height, the Skog’s tail smacks the walls as anger seeps into her expression!“V-Volka…” The Spinner sputters, her disdain giving way to concern as Volka looms over her!“I CHOSE to come along because I wanted to help!” She snarls, eyes wide and sharp teeth clenched! “But you’re making me work like a godsdamned BEAST WRANGLER!”The Durher recoils as Volka jabs what you assume is a finger in her direction!“Try ta’ enjoy a meal? Nope, I gotta chase you around a train! Ant gets a job ta’ save someone’s life? No way, because it’s from big, evil LUTZA!”“She’s the WORST!” Counters Tzah-Tzie as she regains some fire in her eyes!“Then quit acting cagey and TELL US WHY, ALREADY!” Roars the Skog! “We’re your FRIENDS!”The cabin is quiet as the grave save for the dull ‘CLUNKS’ Volka’s boots make as she slumps back into her seat. As for Tzah-Tzie, well… the girl looks like she’s been hit by a truck.After a few minutes of complete, uncomfortable silence, her dulcet voice quakes out a quiet response:“... Okay.”&gt;CONTD."

I KNEW it!” Volka exclaims, her tail thumping triumphantly on the floor! “Didn’t I say, Rook!? I knew she had another name!”Part of you wants to reveal TT had another name before that, but you’d rather not ruin it for Detective Volka here…“It was a first draft, really… but it also came with my first attempt at being a Spinner…” Continues the catthing with a nostalgic sigh. “I was reckless… barely knew my way around a stage… but I knew how to sing. And I knew how to play.”Adjusting her position in her seat, TT continues. “I found out early on that you can get pretty popular if you ‘challenge’ other Spinners… didn’t know it at the time, but it’s frowned upon. Not necessarily illegal.”So you’d, what, just hop onstage and start playing?“I wasn’t THAT much of a menace! Sheesh…”Sighs the Spinner as she hugs her tail close, “I’d ambush ‘em at the end of their set, is all! The crowds loved it!”You sincerely doubt her opponents ‘loved it’, but you hold your tongue. “At the time I was living the dream…” She purrs with a glimmer in her eyes! “Traveling from venue to venue any way I could… crossing Striiliis with other Spinners… I felt like… like a wandering duelist, y’know? And sometimes my opponent and I would share ideas… a few drinks…”The Durher’s face turns a little red as she revisits the memories. Guess that isn’t all they shared.“But I soon found out that talent can only get ya’ so far…” Tzah-Tzie frowns. “Well… that and my instrument.”And there it is. Lutza had acted strange about TT’s Striilii…“Y’see,” She begins as her eyes fall upon Volka, “My real name, Volkie, is RUUSDI. SULASTIR.”The info hits the Skog like a poisoned dart. It takes a moment to settle in, but once it does, Volka all but tumbles onto the floor in front of her!“S-S-S-SULASTIR!?!” She sputters from her spot on the floor, “Th-THE RUUPPAA FOLKS!?”“Yep,” TT sighs, averting her weary gaze from the awestruck Skog.“Th-this is INSANE, Tzah… errr, Baael-no, RUUSDI!” Volka stammers! “I… I musta’ drank your entire family’s vineyard twelve times over!” Her childlike excitement gives way to stunned realization. “W-wait… we GOTTA visit! D-do they do free samples!? Oh, and yer’ folks can meet Anton!”“That’s… not going to happen.” The Durher replies flatly. “Meeting my family, that is.”&gt;CONTD."

Okay…”“I’ll explain later, Volkie, but… one step at a time.” Giving one of her ears an idle scratch, Tzah-Tzie continues to squeeze her tail like a pillow. “Anyways, now you both know that I come from money. A lot.”“Pfft, THAT’S an under-” Realizing she’s interrupting again, the Skog plugs her mouth with both claws! “... sorry!”“... Feelings about my family aside,” Continues the Spinner, “I was pretty close with my sisters…” A faint smile forms on the girl’s stony face. “My big sis NUUSI, especially. She’d always catch me singing when no one was around… drumming my claws on metal… that kind of thing.”Just like that, her smile fades.“Felt like someone ripped my guts out the day she got married.” Her eyes glance over your way. “Not to Vhale, Ant, but… same organization.”“Oh, honey…” Volka mutters under her breath.“When I got… engaged...” She continues, her voice trembling at the word, “She got me an instrument.”A striili. The Durher nods. Volka seems keen on asking about the engagement, but manages to hold it in when she studies TT’s somber expression.“Silkwood. Chee mane strings.” You can’t see it, but you can tell she’s imagining holding it again. “Immaculately-smoothed, perfectly balanced… sang like a godsdamned angel…”As swiftly as her smile appears, it fades.“... and that smug slut TOOK it from me.”And there it is.“S-she stole it!?” Stammers Volka, her expression morphing into a blend of sympathy and incredulous disbelief, “W-what are we waiting for, Rook?! Let’s get it back!”Yea!“No.” The bitter tone in TT’s voice takes you both by surprise and knocks all the wind out of your collective ‘sails’. N-no?“I was so stupid…” Growls the Spinner, shaking her head in dismay, “I HAD her! I had that crowd eating out of my claws!” Tzah-Tzie deflates as her memory catches up to her. “... I was certain to win… so why shouldn’t I have made a little bet?”You have enough pieces to put together the rest of the puzzle. So she lost th-“SHE CHEATED!” TT explodes, eyes wide and teeth bared! “I don’t know how… she… she used magic! Bribed the audience members! SOMETHING!”Her anger is swiftly replaced by sobs. “...

It’s a tough pill to swallow, but Lutza didn’t seem that cold and calculating… did she?“Do… do whatever the HELLS you want…” The Durher spits from behind her tail, “I’m not doing ANYTHING for her.

Volk, you mutter befpre clearing your throat, can she come with you? Rather than respond immediately, the big gal turns her attention back towards the crying catthing!“TT, sweetheart,” She coos, giving the girl another scritch behind the ears, “Are you gonna be alright on your own?”“Yes...” She groans, rolling her watery eyes like an angsty teen. “Have a blast, you two…”Yep, she’s still mad.

Tasty air…”Thanks for the backup back there, Volk, you sigh as you give the amazon a grateful pat on the arm. Seriously.“Any time, Rook.” She replies as the mirth drains from her expression. “Hells, though… never pegged our little TT to be so…” Her face scrunches up as she desperately searches for the right word. Complex?“Y-yea, that!” She confirms with a hasty nod! “Here I was thinkin’ she just didn’t like Lutza’s music…” Continuing towards the Leisure Cart, you get about a minute or two of silence before the Skog speaks up again!“... didn’t wanna ask in the thick of things, but…”You shoot the Skog a sidelong glance.

ALLOW ME THE PLEASURE OF INTRODUCING MYSELF!”Even with magical magnification you could identify that voice a mile away… following the rest of the crowd’s gaze, your eyes fall upon a familiar pint-sized performer striding through the parting crowd like she owns the damn place!TZAH-TZIE!&gt;CONTD."

AND I COME BEFORE YOU ALL TODAY TO RECLAIM WHAT WAS UNJUSTLY TAKEN FROM ME…”Every eye in the cart follows TT’s gaze over to Lutza’s lap… and the Striilii currently sitting there!“I AM TZAH-TZIE: MEISTER OF MUSIC! VOCAL VIRTUOSO… AND TODAY I CHALLENGE LUTZA… TO A DUEL!”“She REFUSES!” Snaps Joplin from his corner of the cart! “As her manager, I-”Can do nothing, it seems! Before he can finish, Lutza stands up with a twinkle in her amethyst eyes and a grin almost too big for her face! “I ACCEPT!”Grinning ear to ear, Tzah-Tzie leaps into the Triplet’s arms and is soundly catapulted across the cart and onto the stage!“CRUSH’ER, MISS LUTZA!”“SHOW’ER WHAT’CHA GOT!”“WE’RE ALL ROOTIN’ FOR YA!”Welp, can’t fault them on their enthusiasm… Joplin probably will later, though, based on how angry he looks! Sharing an eager grin with TT, Lutza turns her attention to the band members from before.“Care to accompany us, boys?”You’d think they were asked by the god of ROCK himself! Scrambling onto the stage, the musicians set up for the battle as you turn your attention back over to your targe–wait, where’d he go!?Being a Mzz’goe’virr, it isn’t hard to pick him out from the crowd, especially as he turns to scramble out of the cart! HEY!“The situation has changed!” He hisses to some unseen ally, “Go to Plan B!

Leaving her on guard duty, you manage to navigate the passenger jungle through a combined effort of acrobatics, ‘s’cuse me’s, and a new, exciting maneuver you just came up with called…LATERAL LIMBOING!https://youtu.be/tPJGN20Ey_4No time for that! C’mon!https://youtu.be/gNHooTszyW4It doesn’t take long for the Mzz’goe’virr to notice he’s being followed… Shooting you a glance over his shoulder mid-stride, the mage does what his title suggests and whips up some magic for ya! Feeling your teeth buzz, you whip out your MAGIC SHIELD and brace for impact-“Is that Lutza I h-OOF!”The speedy sorcerer is too focused on you to notice where he’s headed–straight for a Mox lady poking her head out of her cabin! Smacking into her, the Mzz’goe’virr growls as his spell hits the carpet instead, covering it with something hissing, crunching, and smelling like eucalyptus!You leap over it, of course–lord knows he wasn’t trying to give you a spa treatment! Landing on the other side, you offer a quiet ‘sorry!’ to the Mox madame before pirouetting through a cluster of icicles! Or really cold spikes! Hard to tell!“No, no… It’s quite alright! I’ll take your plates-OOH!”Your pursuee barely makes it past his last obstacle before another one dips into the corridor: a cheerful Gnok conductress who, from the sound of things, is balancing a stack of dishware when the Mzz’goe’virr mage shoves past her and sends it all flying!“O-OH NOOOOO!”Not on your watch! Dropping to your knees, you slide over just in time to catch the poor girl mid-stumble AND catch and stack all of her plates like a tower! Planting her back on her feet with the dishes unscathed, you leave the girl with a grin before spinning around and resuming the chase!“Th-thank you, sir!” She stammers, cheeks redder than cherries!Don’t mention it! Ducking a patch of screeching tentacles swiping at you from the ceiling, you continue after the mage and see your chance when the door to the next cart opens and reveals a Teksoul!“YOu ARe cauSInG A DISturB-”“HA!”The whole car quakes as a burst of force rushes from the mage’s claw sending the automaton screeching back the way it came! Stealing a glance your way, the Mzz’goe’virr curses under his breath before another blast erupts from his palm–this one tearing through the wall with a deafening metal shriek! Ears popping from the sudden change in cabin pressure, you stumble against the side of the corridor as the mage scrambles up to the roof of the train like a lizard!“So long, fool!”&gt;CONTD."

Good thing, too–you get the feeling Volka would have a rough time climbing up!Dropping back into the train with your MITARAAN AMULET shaking up a storm in your pocket, you stiffen like a flagpole at the sound of some unfamiliar voices just down the hall!“-ate when they just stand there like that… eerie.”“Don’t worry– Esker and Hommand already located the wards. Self-disappating, to boot.”Peeking around the corner, you spot the two Conductors, one Durher, one Molegg, inspecting the Teksoul the Mzz’goe’virr sent reeling earlier–its ‘face dimmer, but still glowing!“Hells… there’s gonna be another meeting about this, isn’t there?” Groans the Molegg as an unnerving grinding noise creaks out from his shoulders!“Not if we clean it all up!” Hisses the Durher through clenched teeth! “Most of the passengers are still watching that ‘performance’--we patch the hole up and track down whoever put it there… Breezy Bells!”“Heh. Performance…” The Molegg remarks as you creep your way towards your cabin, “You a Lutza fan?”“Not in the least… but my kits never shut up about her.”Slipping into your cabin with Rezzie in tow and no one the wiser, you gently drop the devil onto one of the plush chairs, earning a mumble of approval from the drowsy demon! Glad she approves…Watching her snore peacefully despite taking a piece of architecture to the face, you can’t help but let a smile form on your face… the jury’s out on whether she was serious about aiming for you or just being her usual prickly self, but one thing’s for certain:You’re really, REALLY happy she’s okay.

Diving through the door like an Anton-sized missile, your eyes widen in horror when neither Lutza or TT are anywhere to be seen!… Okay, you know it’s dark, but seriously, though! Where are they!? There’s still quite a crowd, of course, but the stage appears to be empty… aside from a few Teksouls milling about…“AAAAAAAAAAAANTTT!”Now it’s your turn to be hit by a missile–this one soft, small, and TREMBLING with energy as she crashes into your side! Hopping up and down with a look on her face akin to a kid who just won a Little League Game, TT looks LOADS happier than she did the last time you saw her!“DIDJASEEDIDJASEEDIDJASEE!?”Errr, the duel?

Her stalkers were gonna blow it sky-high! If that startles the Gnok, he doesn’t show it. “Yes, the sudden activity among the Conductors would appear to corroborate that. You have our thanks, Mr. Peas… and our reward, as agreed upon.” He concludes, handing over a weighty pouch of bells!+3000 BELLS! NEW TOTAL: 7600!“Gee,” Giggles Tzah-Tzie as her tail gently strokes your leg, “Dunno why, but you suddenly look a whole lot cuter, Ant~”“Monetary worth has no demonstrated effect on ‘cuteness’.” Drones Lutza’s manager with nary a blink! “On a separate, but equally-important note, I’d like to go over the logistics for the Lutza Versus Tzah-Tzie…” He pauses to release a disgusted groan, “‘SLAMboree’.”And there it is, confused blink number three! Your eyes are proper moisturized now!“Like it?” Smiles the Spinner as she gives her tail a playful flick! “Course ya’ do–I came up with it~”TT, you hiss through clenched and very perplexed teeth, explain.“Allow me.” Joplin interrupts while TT continues to smug it up at your side, “Stupid, reckless, and litigious actions aside, your friend’s little challenge made the crowd ‘go wild’, to use the common vernacular.” A rare twinkle appears in the corner of Joplin’s steely eye! “We wish to capitalize on their fervor.”“A concert, Ant!” The Spinner snickers as she gives your robe an excited tug! “A whole crowd of people watching me DESTROY Lutza! And we’ll get paid!”“I can’t speak on the first point, but the second is a guarantee, yes.” Nods the Gnok before shooting you a wary glance. “We’ll have to set a date, of course, as well as a venue. What are your thoughts?”The questions pile onto you like a sack full of anvils! C-can we talk about it later?“We can, but time is, as they say, money.” Joplin sighs. “Worry not about your long-term arrangements–I’m of the opinion that we capitalize on this sooner rather than later. One performance. One venue. One ‘duel’.”&gt;CONTD."

Simply inform the front desk that you have some TAIL CREAM to deliver–I’ll ensure they know where to send you.”Damn… speaking of professional… Oh, and about that stalker–Your explanation is cut short by an immaculately-kept claw pressing against your lips!

Helping the harmonizer back to her feet, you plant your hands on your hips and adopt an adequately irritated expression before asking the question burning a hole in your head:What is she doing here?“‘Twice 223’, yea?” She replies, cocking her head to the side. “You’re going the wrong way.”Truth be told, you have no clue how you managed to find her cabin the first time, you reply with a shrug and a confused grin! Wait a sec–how’d she know about Lutza’s cabin number anyways!? She was in the cage!TT’s ‘innocent’ gaze evades yours as she gently taps something metal against the wall. “Miiiiiiighta’ stole that Gnok’s Rail Pass.”TT!“Shhh!” She sputters with an incredulous look on her face, “I was gonna give it back! A-and I still will! Of course! Honestly, Anton! If trust was water you wouldn’t give me a drop!”Can she blame you? Did she really come all this way to give you directions?

Constantly reeling her in! Putting up with her petty crimes! Adapting to plans SHE told you to follow! And for what? A roll in the sack? A kind word here and there?

Wiping the tears from her soggy face, Tzah-Tzie’s eyes find a spot on the wall across from her as she digests what you said.“You’re right,” she croaks with a weary look on her face, “I hurt you there too, didn’t I?” She steals a sad glance at your face and sniffs. “It left a scar.”You stay silent. It certainly stuck with you.“Do you know how many songs there are about love?” The Spinner asks, shooting you a sidelong glance. “Stories? Poems?” Her eyes sink to the floor as if she’d stopped to do a recount. “I lost track growing up… spent my days getting lost in some dusty corner of our two-story library when I was able to slip out of my lessons.” A rueful laugh wriggles free of her lips. “I can still feel the soreness on my claws from feeling so many words… must have spent years hidden away in that forest of fiction… stories. Music. Art. They kept me alive.”A nostalgic smile works its way onto her damp face. “Never really understood art’s version of love, though.

So scared I couldn’t even really explain it…” Another sniff. “And you were so understanding and kind that… that I thought you understood.”She wipes another tear off her cheek. “But I hurt you… and now I’m…” Her lip trembles as her mind catches up with her emotions. “I’m starting to realize just how deep that wound is…”Stifling a gasping sob, Tzah-Tzie tries her best to keep her waterlogged eyes locked with yours. “I still don’t know what love is, Ant… but…”…but?&gt;CONTD."

It feels like such a small detail in retrospect, but you’d be lying if you said you weren’t feeling loads better than before… and what better way to celebrate than by teasing your favorite fuzzball?One more thing, you begin, prompting the performer to skid to a halt and send a sunny grin your way!“Anything~” She coos, her tail wagging so hard it smacks the walls like a club!Well, you shrug, in her speech she mentioned having kits and-Presto Change-O: the girl’s now MORTIFIED! Stammering up a storm, Tzah-Tzie snatches her wagging tail and presses it close to her chest as she struggles to put out an answer!“O-of COURSE you’d pick THAT out of all the beautiful things I said!” She whines, wringing her tail between her claws like a wet towel! “Mister Predictable, ladies and gentlemen! You’re insufferable, you know that!?”You’ve been called worse. She hasn’t answered your question, by the way–what was that ab-“I heard ya’ the FIRST time!” She snarls, smacking her head in self-inflicted punishment! “Stupid, stupid, stupid…” Turning her freshly-fierce face your way, the Spinner scowls as she struggles to come up with an answer. “I mean… I would like them eventually...”With that, her face disappears behind her tail again. “... If you would…”Would… Does she think that would even work? You’re a human and she’s a Durher, so-“I dunno!” She replies in a tone usually reserved for answering when someone asks what you want for dinner, “Maybe we can, maybe we can’t! Guess we won’t know til’ we try a few dozen times…” A devious smirk forms on her face! “Oh no...”There’s never been any hybrids of anything running around? No Skurers? Moltrees? Mzz’goe’veeti?“Not to my knowledge, no…” Frowns the furball. “Can we worry about that later, though?” She grimaces. “Like… much later? I tolja’ before, Durher kits are… they can be a handful.”What was the number again? Eight in a litter?“Pfft!” Snickers the Spinner, “Yea, at LEAST! Didn’t I tell you I was one of twelve?”NGH!“And that was my mom’s first batch.”GCK!“Uh-huh,” She nods with a smile in her tone, “Enjoy your freedom while it lasts, bub, cuz when Durhers are ready, well…” A sinister glimmer appears in her eye. “We’re READY.”Trotting over to give your hand a squeeze, you remain catatonic as the catthing’s tail caresses your leg. “Pick your tongue back up off the floor, Ant. We’ve got ‘Happily Ever After’ to think about it, remember?”&gt;CONTD."

The rest of the trip is relatively quiet, but you can tell just by proximity that the girl is positively GLOWING... even more so than after a night of your usual antics!“446, sir!” She announces, drumming her claws against a cabin door like she was a Conductor herself, “Oh, and tips are very much appreciated!” Here’s a tip, you reply with a cheeky grin, hang out with better humans. The quip earns you a playful jab to the leg! Owww…“Quiet, you.” TT grumbles with a wry smirk. “I already sunk my claws into the best human, thank you very much~”Yea? Wait til’ she sees Earth! The Durher defiantly shakes her head!“Nope! Made my choice! I’m a girl of principles, y’know!”Punctuating her sentence with a giggle, TT moves to leave you to your meeting. WAIT, you exclaim, you-“I know, I know,” She groans, rolling her eyes in mock annoyance, “Volkie and I’ll stay away from the cabin…” The Spinner frowns in quiet contemplation. “For whatever reason you have.”Just… give it a bit, okay? Tzah-Tzie shrugs. “Sure, why not? Meet us in the Dining Cart when you’re done–I’m starving.”One more thing, you add, the girl squeaking in surprise as you pick her up and plant a kiss on her lips, you love her… okay?If Durhers could melt, she’d be doing it right now! “I… I love you too, Ant~” TT babbles as her tail wraps around your leg! “Y’know… you don’t HAVE to meet her yet-”Uh-uh, nice try! Ignoring her pouting, you place TT back onto the carpet and smile as she makes her exit…A part of you is anxious as you knock on Lutza’s door, but the rest of you, well… the rest of you feels like everything’s gonna be okay.&gt;CONTD."

That voice, those eyes, that gentle laugh… they all make Lutza a very, very hard girl to say no to. Giving you a once-over, a wry grin forms on the musician’s face as she concludes her analysis.“... you and Tzah-Tzie are close, aren’t you?”How did-oh right, you awkwardly laugh, her scent, huh?“There’s that, yes,” She replies with a nod, “You were too busy pursuing my… fan... to listen to our performance, weren’t you?”Yea, you reply, did you miss something? The question makes your host smile even more. “Oh, she might’ve dedicated her performance to an unnamed ‘muse’...” She explains with a gentle laugh. “It was nice to see her again… despite the circumstances.”She seemed happy to run into you again too, you nod, in, uh, her own way…Lutza’s smile droops. “She has every right to hate me, yes…” Her amethyst eyes meet yours. “But believe me when I say my reasons are just.” Giving her special Striilii a strum, the girl lets out a somber sigh. “She’ll earn her instrument back soon… I’m certain of that.”A lull blankets the conversation… what do?&gt;Did she call you here to discuss something?&gt;Can TT have her Striilii now?&gt;About this concert…&gt;Let’s talk about your Stalker…&gt;That favor she promised…&gt;Why do you think she’ll earn it soon?&gt;Write-In!"

So, you begin, clearing your throat as you get comfortable, was there a reason she called you here alone?“Straight to business. Good.” Rising from her seat, the Spinner approaches you with an uncertain expression. “First, let me apologize in advance…” The girl makes a point to clear her throat before continuing. “There are some… topics... I won’t be able to expand on due to… contractual obligations.”You scowl. The one Joplin mentioned about the Spicys, right? Must be some contract… Lutza nods with a sad glimmer in her eyes. “You could say that, yes…”What did they make her agree to anyways? Knowing them it was something crappy, right? The Durher nods. Care to elaborate?“I… can’t.”She can’t… or she won’t?“... Yes.”D’oh! Well if that’s the case, you’ll just have to make do! What can she talk about? Lutza takes a seat on a nearby chair’s armrest.“There’s a man in… that organization,” she hisses, wincing in unseen pain! “I believe… you know him…”You open your mouth to ask who, but the girl shakes her head. “You… know…”Okay, you frown, this guy she’s talking about: what does-“He should die.”Oh, you remark with a surprised blink, that’s… ah. Does… does Joplin know about this? Does he care?“Yes and no,” Smiles the Spinner, clearly relieved to change to a topic she can speak more on, “Joplin has little love for those people. He’s as trustworthy as he is professional.”DAAAAYYYYUUUUMMMM! Lutza nods in amused assent!“Yep!” She giggles before putting back on a straight face. “That said, I don’t want him or my security detail to be put at risk, hence why I wanted to speak with you alone.”Okay, you reply, scratching your neck with a nervous chuckle, but why you? What’s so special?“I know what occurred in that casino was no accident,” Lutza replies with a glimmer in her gem-like eyes! “When I saw you throwing… their... property into chaos… I realized you were the first in ages to send them scattering like that.”The Spicys?

Err, you mutter, you could go for a song, yea-The tune leads in with a series of urgent, sharp strums… like an alarm for the people listening!

Should I be worried?”You’re… not sure, you reply in as diplomatic a tone as you can muster! The rank-and-file cult members tend to be dumber than a sack of doorknobs… but their leader, this LARIUS guy…“Larius...” Repeats the musician, “Never heard of a Larius before…”Good, you scoff, because that guy is a piece of WORK! He can, like, write a book on blowing up people’s heads! And they were trying to get her so they could turn her into a sleeper agent, or something!Letting your explanation steep for a bit, Lutza finally breaks the silence with a determined look on her face! “It’s a long shot, Anton, but the mages at TRIMBALT MAGE ACADEMY might know a thing or two!” Her expression sinks back into frown territory. “IIiiiffff they don’t turn you into a Maakar, that is. Or banish you to an Arcane Labyrinth.”The frown’s contagious, it seems! They’d do that?

Lutza cocks her head to the side in confusion. Nevermind, you tell her, she doesn’t know him!“Well wherever your adventures take you next, Anton,” She concludes, “I’m extremely grateful for everything you’ve done for me.” A sad smile creeps onto the Durher’s face. “And for what it’s worth, I’d appreciate it if you take care of Tzah-Tzie.” Her tail gives her chair a gentle tap. “Us Spinners need to stick together… even though we’re constantly competing.”Seems like you two have much more going on than that, you remark, causing Lutza’s smile to grow bigger!“We don’t,” She sighs, “And yet we do.” An uncomfortable silence fills the gap between you. “... She reminds me of myself when I was first starting out.”You can’t help but shoot the girl an incredulous look!

You’d nearly forgotten, given how TT usually takes center stage when talking about the Spinner, but now that you’ve got Lutza here, well…Actually, you smile, it sounds a little silly, you know, but-“You stuck your neck out for me when you had no reason to, Anton,” The Spinner chirps with a playful grin! “No request is silly coming from you as far as I’m concerned!”You’re starting to see why people like this chick so much–TT could learn a thing or two from her about PR! Well if that’s the case, you continue, your friend Volka is a huge fan of hers… emphasis on huge!“Awww, really?” Coos the Durher as you frown at her for not understanding your clever joke, “Well I’m a HUGE fan of her being a HUGE fan of me! Haha~”Oh… she doesn’t know Volka. She never would have gotten it… Right.“Anton?”Oh yea, right! So, you continue after quickly clearing your throat, if it’s not too much to ask, would she mind, y’know-“OH!” Lutza exclaims, bolting upright in her chair with an idea in her eyes, “Wait just a moment, okay?” Rolling out of her chair and onto the floor, the girl roots through what must be a MOUNTAIN of luggage! So uh, this wasn’t just a room for meeting, huh?“Nope, this is my private cabin!” She laughs, flinging clothes and accessories all over the place as she digs! “I love what Joplin and The Triplets do for me, I do, but I just can’t sleep if I’m sharing a room with someone.” The girl punctuates her sentence with a sigh. “It’s a curse…”Responding with a noncommittal ‘gotcha’, you watch as Lutza returns to her seat with something cradled in her claws! Clearing her throat a few times, the Spinner speaks into the object as it omits a faint magical crackle in her lap!“Hey Volka, this is Lutza! I hear you like to cheer me on… and I’d like to return the favor!”Blinking in confusion, you wisely decide to keep your mouth shut as the girl concludes her message! “Wherever you are, whatever you’re doing, know that your biggest fan Lutza is rooting for you! Lutza Loooove~”The Durher squeezes in one last giggle before the magical energy crackles away. “It’s not as good as the real thing, but,” Lutza explains as she hands you a warm, ridge-covered disc, “I hope Volka likes it!”What uh… what is it, exactly? “They’re called SPEAKSTONES!” Smiles the Spinner! “Joplin ordered them in bulk during our last trip to Umberal. You can record a message in them and they’ll repeat it whenever you want!”Wow, you remark as you give the disc a few pokes, fancy!&gt;CONTD."

All of Zoral’s gonna be using them some day, I’ll bet.” Nods the musician. “It’s a shame you’ve got so much… business to attend to–Umberal truly is something else!”You can hardly wait… rising from your chair with Volka’s gift in tow, you send a grateful smile Lutza’s way before heading towards the door! It’s been nice getting to know her, you remark as you prepare to leave, given the circumstances.“Anton,” Before you can ask, you get your answer when Lutza scampers over and wraps your leg in a warm, and VERY SOFT hug!“Thank you again,” She whispers as you feel her tail brush against your other leg, “Safe travels wherever they lead you.”Her lavender eyes move to meet yours. “And please… look out for Tzah-Tzie for me. There’s a… familiar sadness in those eyes of hers.” Your leg gets another tender squeeze. “Give her something to smile about, okay?”You’ll certainly try, you shrug with a wry grin on your face! Leaving Lutza to her lodgings, you lightly loiter as you look to your next labor… Rezzie hasn’t burned down the train yet, so either your precautions worked or she’s got something else in mind. The question is, do you fill TT and Volka in now… or later?... Or maybe you get a Conductor to check in on her?

There’s no telling what’ll happen if you head in there unprotected, but if you shut things down then the devil inside might go back to her usual… Rezzieness.Can’t have that!Wrapping the WARM CLOAK you bought back in Crossroads and the BATHHOUSE TOWEL around your face like a scarf, you take a few test breaths before making your move…A rush of warm, flowery air rushes to greet your face as you open the door–the saccharine scents making your nose tingle even through the makeshift scarf!

Maybe it’s the pheromones, but Rezzie’s eyes light up like Hellish Christmas Trees at the suggestion! “YES!” She exclaims, before clasping her claws over her mouth a bit too late! “E-err, I mean… Pfft… I suppose…”There’s something refreshing about the old Rezzie being able to fight past the pheromones like that… okay, you nod, you’ll go grab ‘em and we’ll all visit. Sound good?A strange smile creeps onto Rezalith’s face. “... Like friends?”Yea, you reply, like friends. Moving to open the door, you’re stopped by a hasty ‘WAIT!’ from your demonic pal! Y-yea?“Mind turning off these stupid pheromones before you go?” She asks, her face wrinkling at the saccharine scent. “I have a reputation to uphold, y’know.”Right, you remark, how careless of you… errr, PHEROMONES OFF…? It only takes a few seconds before you feel a significant difference in the air… did… did that work?“Think so…” Observes the devil as she samples the room with a few quick sniffs! “Oh… one more thing.”Yea, you ask as you tug the door open.A fist meets your smile at terminal velocity, transforming you from a human into a pile of aches and pains on the floor outside of the cabin! Yep… pheromones are turned off… oough…“Dope me up with your freaky little DATE RAPE GAS again and I’ll revoke your SKIN privileges, ANTURD!” Slamming the door shut in your face, Rezzie leaves you to track down your pals as a significantly more bruised, beaten, but also happy guy…The band’s finally getting back together!&gt;CONTD."

You can fill her in on what’s been going on after!“Why not?” Rezzie remarks as she collapses into a chair, eliciting a panicked squeak from the Durher now crushed underneath! “Not much to tell, but…”“Not much to tell!?” Volka scoffs with an incredulous stare, “Rezzie, last time we saw you, ya’ ran off after a GREATER DEMON!”“Y-yea…” Whimpers Tzah-Tzie as she crawls out from underneath the hellion like a fuzzy cockroach, “What… What happened…?”“Oho~,” Grins the demon, “Interested in my exploits, are we?

Waking from a restless, sorry excuse of a sleep, you peel your face off of the rock you used as a pillow and grumble at the sound of creatures chirping and trilling to greet the morning sun!Not that they could see it, of course. Dumb beasts. You start the day with your usual routine: a biiiiiig stretch, a yawn, and your favorite: picking your teeth for any leftover morsels from your last meal! There’s joy to be found in routines–you learned that much back in CHAA’TAI– but as you shuffle through your rote morning tasks, you can’t help but feel… well, unstimulated.It’s no surprise, of course–you’ve been tailing that GREATER DEMON for days now. Even YOU could use a little rest now and then… not as much as that FAT-HEADED WASTE OF AIR AN-You interrupt your inner rant by giving your cheeks a few slaps–forget that, Rezzie, you think with a fresh frown on your face, he’s DEAD to you… and with any luck he’ll be dead to EVERYONE soon!

Everything you do is important, naturally! Indulging in a yawn, you gather what little belongings you have and make your way to the entrance of the cave you spent the night in. The owner was quite delicious, if not a bit gamey, but as you shiver with delight at the sound of the roaring waterfall hiding the cavern entrance, you make the decision to continue your hunt today!No more loafing about and feeling sa-err, FURIOUS!

Finding another demon is no hard feat for another demon–even miles apart you can still pick up a faint titter of hellish energy. Not sure why, but them’s the breaks!Taking to the sky, you do a few lazy loops before you reach your desired altitude: nice and high to avoid any trees or hills, but not too high to not pick up chatter down below. Critters fill the crisp mountain air with a chorus of trills and whistles, their only accompaniment a steady wind billowing across the clear skies! To your mixed pleasure, you don’t hear much during your flight–wherever that Cult Lair was, it wasn’t close to any settlements… you’re still out in the boonies!Some day you’ll have to turn all of this into a big monument to yourself, or something. Maybe a big blood fountain?All of this blood talk coupled with your hasty morning soon takes its toll on your stomach–it’s a blessing and a curse, this HELLISH metabolism of yours! Your immaculate figure remains the same even after the biggest feast, but you find yourself getting hungry ALL. THE. TIME! What’s a girl to do?Slowing to a lazy hover, you harness the power of your SUPERIOR BRAIN and weigh your options: you might have a bead on where the GREATER DEMON went, sure, but they can cover ground much quicker than you can even when they’re flying! Not to mention they got a bit of a head start on you.In short, you don’t have time to cook… you’ll have to find food NOW! The question is… where will you get it? Stupid Anton, taking all the trail rations… he could certainly use one or ten, though, that skinny FREAK!Hope he chokes on &#039;em.&gt;CONTD."

A proper meal would hit the spot… maybe one of those big things that Volka is, or a pack of whatever The Snack is supposed to be? Tracking down prey was easy when you were in the city, but here?Well, you’d be lying if you didn’t appreciate the quiet, but it’s not exactly teeming with meal options! … wonder what an Anton would taste like? Probably gamey and stringy based on what you’ve seen of the miserable wretch. You’d be lying if you weren’t curious about a new species, though…It’s then that you hear it: something big and clumsy trotting through the thick underbrush below. Twigs crunching. Ferns rustling.Either it’s too stupid to know better, or it’s big enough to not consider anything a threat… both fairly common stories in CHAA’TAI.The air stings your cheeks as you pick up speed in your descent–by the time you can hear the trees rustling in the wind you’ve already clocked your prey’s speed and direction. Now it’s just a matter of…A shrill squeal pierces the canopy as your quarry finally senses your rapid approach! Too little, too late! Descending upon them like a mighty raptor, you grin in defiance as you feel a shower of rough spines hit your face. The defense might’ve worked against other predators, but you?You’re something special.The beast’s backbone buckles under you as you crash into it at terminal velocity–your prey barely letting out a baleful whine before you tear into its warm, inviting flesh!The beast’s blood sizzles against your skin as you gorge yourself on the fresh kill–its tender meat and juicy fat practically dripping off the bones as you feel a familiar euphoria wash over your body… your eyes roll back, your heartbeat quickens, your-“Can we skip this bit?”Now it’s TT’s turn to piss of Rezzie, apparently. Shooting a menacing glare at the Durher, the devil answers her through clenched, and clearly irritated teeth!“But it’s the BEST PAAAAAARTT!”We’re glad she’s having fun, you interject with a placating tone, but just for future reference, Rez: friends don’t fantasize about eating other friends.The demon scoffs. “So what, you want me to just lie about not wanting to sample your no-doubt delectable flesh?”Yea, you reply, that’s… that’s what you were getting at, yea.“Interesting question, though, isn’t it?” Muses Volka as she rubs her chin in thought! “Like, whaddaya’ think you taste like, TT?”“Hmmm…. Tender, definitely!” The Durher replies, smirking at the absurdity! “Ohh, and probably pretty rich, too–the smaller bites always are!” She shoots the Skog an appraising glance. “And ya’ know what, Volkie? I bet you’d be kinda tough on the outside, but dig a bit deep and-”&gt;CONTD."

Rez, get on with the story! And quit talking about eating friends!“Pfft, killjoy.” Rolling her eyes, Rezalith continues her tale… After taking another dip to wash off all the viscera, you spent the majority of the day following the fiendish fragrance! It’s a good thing THE LIZ or whatever Anton called it wounded your prey–even with the GREATER DEMON’S head start you’re able to follow the relatively straight trail it cut along the ground!You’re unsure if it was luck or a good guess, but Anton’s counterpart was wise to cripple the demon’s wings… but wit will only get you so far!You fly for another day or so before the once-distant scent becomes thick and rank–strong enough to make your eyes and sinuses burn with how close the source is! Still high in the sky, you pinpoint the owner of the blood to a small perimeter of what smells like a bog… that’d slow him down for sure.Saliva pools in your mouth as you lick your chops in earnest–despite the protests of those fools you once called ‘traveling companions’, you DID it! You tracked the GREATER DEMON! With luck he’ll be too weary to put up a full offensive, and then?A fire flickers to life in your chest.You’ll take the demon’s power for yourself… and carve a foothold in the long climb towards complete, uncontested FREEDOM.Something tugs at your mind, however–something weak, but enough to give you pause before divebombing your prize…If you’re so tough, and smart, and all of the other things you always claim to be… then fine! LEAVE!The echoed words sting you just as much as they did when you heard them before… they shouldn’t have rattled you like they did–you’re REZALITH! You ARE all of the things you say you are!… so then why are you thinking about what ANTON would do in this situation?What do?&gt;Swoop in quick while it’s quiet!&gt;Do some fly-by reconnaissance! &gt;Land nearby and creep over!&gt;Make a distraction, see if anything shows itself!&gt;Just wait for a bit…&gt;Write-In!&gt;&gt;6278387The best kind"

Once whatever was hiding this thing went down, that is!”“Good to know the Skyrail’s almost demon-proof…” Mutters TT under her breath.The scent only went away… or, well, changed, you continue, AFTER Rezzie tried to cast her spell! “Think something happened while she was konked out?” TT asks, tilting her head to the side.That’s one theory, you reply with a soft ‘heh!’ and a smile! But there’s another possibility: Rezalith’s spell might have messed with the demon too!“It’s not impossible…” The Durher replies with a few swishes of her tail. “Spell malfunctions can be pretty nasty… and unpredictable at the best of times!”“Mhm! Used ta’ know a mage who fat-fingered a spell once!” Adds Volka as she laughs at the story she’s about to tell! “Made his voice squeakier than a Durher kit’s! Permanently!” Her smile droops. “... He WAS a Durher, though, so it wasn’t really that weird, but… but y’know…”Rez, you continue, what spell was she trying to cast anyways? The devil shrugs.“Nothing special–Old Bones said something about it being a GHASTLY WAIL or something? Spooks people, especially the dumb ones.” A toothy grin creeps onto her face. “Hey, lemme try it on you!”Y-YIKES!“Problem is,” Sighs the Spinner next to you, “Is that there’s really no telling what a spell failure is gonna look like. You could cast the most innocuous spell ever and it could conjure… I dunno, a giant TZERG or something.”“D-don’t even JOKE about that, T!” Sputters Volka as she casts a wary glance around the cabin! “They… they can’t live on land, right?”The Spinner shrugs. “Dunno! Pretty spooky though, riiiight?”“Y-yikes!”Can we stop saying ‘YIKES’ and think for a minute here!?“You started it…” Mutters Rezalith as she impatiently scratches the arm of her chair.Doubling back to your first theory, you huff, could there have been anyone else out there with the same idea as Rezzie?&gt;CONTD."

Shoulda blown him and his stupid fireworks shop to the next plane…”The question is, you continue with a deepening frown, would any of these people be close enough to pick up on the GREATER DEMON’S position… AND get to it before Rezalith? The Temple’s demon detection can’t be THAT strong, and if a mage was sniffing around Rezzie’s prey then she woulda’ sniffed them out, right?The hellish huntress’ cocky smile falters a bit. “Yea, well… the problem with a demon that size is that it kinda overwhelms your senses…”What, like she couldn’t smell anything else? The demon nods. Well, you sigh as you sink deeper into your chair, that… certainly complicates things…“Ant…” TT’s wary tone makes you bristle a bit. Y-yea? “I think we might also be ignoring another possible… candidate.” Her lime green eyes gradually hike up your side and meet your gaze. “You know who I’m talking about?”It takes you a moment before the realization settles in… she’s… she’s talking about…The Durher nods.Jhairo?Volka perks up. “Huh? What about Jhairo?”“Who’s Jhairo?” Spits Rezzie. “The other big-eyed guy? Not a fan!”“NO, Ant!” Groans the musician! “I’m talking about the OTHER human! The one who got summoned too!”TT’s suggestion slaps you across the face like a gauntlet… Hell, in all of the excitement you’d nearly forgotten about her…LIZ.&gt;CONTD."

Kva would cost you  ten thousand Notr  .. It was doable.Your nightly stroll with Evangelyne had introduced you of some but not all available shops in these squalid, flesh ridden streets. They were- Barracks: The patrolling guards could always use some help to deal with the  Enfleshed -The Blacksmith: An old man keeps hammering his anvil day and night-The Butcher: A lot of mystery meat...is it edible?-The Tailor: An old hag hiding behind rags and curtains-The Antiquarian: A hoarder pretending to be a merchant, would she part with her expensive wares?-The Purifier: A woman of medicine , with a heavy burden on her shoulders -The Fleshtender: A man and his garden of miracles that should not exist. -Meatflakers Pub: A place of respite for the unsung heroes of the district-The Pit: This is where a miner&#039;s journey would begin...and probably end-The Other Pit: The violent, the cocky and the desperate fighting for Notr.&gt;Choose up to two places to explore throughout the night"

Is it still magic, because then I would have an idea.&gt;consider different approach?So the curse effects us, and the Adolls are invested with life that comes from us, could we transfer the curse to one of our adolls? If the curse is magic, transfer it to Mudusa and then her Palebound immunity to magic might let her shake it off.Or if it was some weird time slowing down curse, maybe it might be interesting to transfer that to Evangelyne if she would break down more slowly.Check with Frenkesia, or maybe with that weird magic book put the curse on his shadow lol.Also do we need to send Pedrita to the Miner for them to start and how will that go?"

Not good. It was a hassle to find a secluded spot for you to meet the miner. The man was rightfully skeptical of your dullard of an adoll, her bulky frame was not made for digging but you had reassured him of her incredible strength. She could be more of a bodyguard rather than a digger but still, this was better than nothing. You heard the miner cursing under his breath from your inadequate creation and yet he would accept her aid. Should you keep her with him until he could reach his goal?&gt;No, Pedrita should return by noontide/eventide (what should she do?)&gt;Yes, you could use a break from her ugly mug.The wilderness around the divine excess was a maze of trees, intertwined dirt roads and cliffs. You couldn&#039;t walk a straight line for more than five steps. No wonder your first adoll would spend a lot of time here, the enfleshed infestation did reach a couple of spots in the area merging beasts with the living flesh of the dead goddess creating horrors beyond one&#039;s comprehension. You didn&#039;t wish to lug heavy materials either that might slow you down making this a fruitless outing until... &quot;There, O sightless king, behind the bushes.&quot;  a trail of fresh blood leading to ditch hidden by foliage.

The woman was buried in a shallow grave before heading for the Sky&#039;s hook. On your way there, you had avoided any enfleshed infestion land to the best of your capabilities until you had reached your gravity-defying destination where you saw it.... A massacre Dozens of loyalists dead in what seemed to be a one-sided ambush in this ruined camp. Most of them had their heads pulverized by a mace or a great hammer...such was the way of the savages of the north. The Northsari valued brute strength above all in their frigid wasteland making them excellent bloodthirsty mercenaries for hire. Not all hope was lost though, you could still hear a clash of swords in the distance...desperate men and women struggling fighting to their last?  &quot;Aaakung taag ish vereel, woman. I shall breed with you corpse! Vefg daaer sumaii, hahaha!!&quot;   There he was, Wykvr Vdin was surrounded by lifeless husks of women he had carefully hacked with his less-disfiguring axe, his bloody great hammer was probably reserved for your men. Much like all Northsari, Wykvr was thrice as tall as you. The towering figure before you was currently enjoying the desperate fight between the last survivor of the massacre and his men. A redhead she was who had refused to yield, she drenched in the blood of her enemies as disemboweled yet another guard . The giant of a man was merely toying with her since she was clearly outmatched, what could one woman do against thirty men and the man-beast leading them? &quot;Have you seen the err of your ways, O miserable king? You are but one man, one sad and desperate man without me. She will be plowed till naught is left but paste for the hounds to scavenge. Helpless little thing, you are.&quot;  It was hopeless, to charge forth with your saber was nothing short of madness. The only thing you had on you was the element of surprise which wasn&#039;t much considering the fact they had the numerical advantage. What should you do?&gt;Abandon the last of the loyalist to her fate. (what to do in eventide?)&gt;Boldly announce your presence to Wykvr and his underlings (what to say?)&gt;Charge forth regardless of the consequences.&gt;Wait until the Northsari and their men are done, loot what you can when they are gone&gt;Allow your saber to be corrupted by unseen filth&gt; Surrender your to bloodthirsty spectre.&gt;Consider a different approach?"

Your blade was lighter than air and more powerful than anything you had armed yourself with. The only limitation here was of course your fragile human body. Your initial plan was to strike the Northsari first followed by his men but everything had changed once your loyalist&#039;s shield was shattered after too many hits, she was the priority here.A single slash of your accursed saber would cleave through five men at once followed by another four as you had skewered the man who was about to kill her. For a fraction of a second, your eyes had met each other. she   knew   who you were. The usurped king to rescue? For her, it was something out of ancient tales of chivalry and noble deeds. &quot;What is that thing???!&quot;&quot;He is no ordinary loyalist!&quot;&quot;We are no match for him, REREAT!!!&quot;  As expected, the rest of the guards would leg it after witnessing the grim fate of their comrades, they were used to deal with petty thieves and the average scoundrel not someone with a possessed blade capable of going through them like a hot knife through butter. You had to physically restrain your saber which was yearning for their fleeting blood. In the mean time, you had briefly checked on the injured woman behind you.&quot;Are you alright? Can you stand up?&quot;&quot;M-my lord..&quot; Tears of joy would mingle with the layers of dried and flesh blood on her face &quot;I am not worthy to be saved by...mnrghh..&quot;Despite of her myriad of injuries, the woman caked in blood and mud stood by your side. She was ready to fight the giant of a man with you. Wykvr. Cont.  &quot;Truusn Saxa! If it is"

She was a  reliability  with her nearly spent endurance and the plethora of injuries slowing her sword arm down. &quot; LET ME TASTE HIS ROTTEN BLOOD YOU INCOMPENTET BUFFOON!!!   &quot; The voice inside your head was making it harder for you to focus. Neither of you nor her could circle around him, things were getting rather desperate, you knew you had to breach his area of denial before he would turn you and her into human paste. You ducked under his second swing for a quick slice... or so you thought.  &quot;Vuukres, akhadun! Killed plenty of men going for the same underhanded attack.&quot;   His kick had sent you flying against a pile of chopped wood. Your saber, where was it??? You were too dazed to pierce through the untimely haze around your eyes. You could feel the warm rush of blood by your left temple, your blood. No, now was not your time to die.

It should be more presentable this way to the rebel scum.  &quot;You talk too much.&quot;   with his other free hand, he grabbed her sword arm and...well... He ripped it straight from the socket.  &quot;GGGAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!&quot;  cried the woman in pain, in this particular moment, the world around you had become clearer. You had seized the opportunity by grabbing your saber a few feet to you right for a wicked slice between his legs, you couldn&#039;t aim higher even if you wanted to. A heavy thud would soon follow, it was accompanied by a river of blood as well.....did you just  ended his bloodline?  You might never know the outcome of this uneven fight since your body had given up on you at the worst moment possible, your orb were enshrouded by darkness. Seleno..did you fail to save her?

We are doing what we can to find any survivors and apprehend any pillagers trying to reclaim the trove contaminated goods in the area. It is a long process process alright. Say, who is this woman? Do she have any papers? May I see them?&quot;&gt;A random soul I found on the road&gt;My wife&gt;My sister&gt;My daughter&gt;My Slave&quot;I...err..&quot;&quot;No papers? What a shame...if let&#039;s say three thousand Notr would fall into my empty pockets then I shall handle all the paperwork for you. Just give me a name.

Twice the blood of man and Othertide, a  Pale Kindred  walking amongst us.&quot;  Your knowledge was limited on this particular subject, from what little you understood, the marriage of flesh between man and othertides was hardly a fruitful one... abomination of grotesque features would spawn into this world as a result of the folly of man. However, the Pale Kindreds were a rare exception to this rule. Your noble line had gathered hundred of them in order to &#039;kill&#039; the godkiller due to their extraordinary powers.

She didn&#039;t look threatening at all. &quot;T-there is a fraction of my mother&#039;s power in her soul. Consume her flesh and this knowledge is MRRFGHH, yours!&quot; Was it a lie?

Five thousand a head, pretty generous, no?&quot;Through a hand mirror in hand, one could see an Eastsari village in the desert surrounded by mystical winds...and too many guards.&gt;Refuse such a vile offer, you wouldn&#039;t stain your hands for the sake of Notr.

We get the unattended PK playing with sand.-Inky Festersacks [2 Co] x2 equals 4 Co.The 6 PK eating together and 6 Guards. They&#039;re all together that should make for a nice big group we can stun. But as a precaution let&#039;s say we use two Ink sacks to make sure both groups are stunned and we take care of them without spilling blood if we can. That is hopefully 8 PK captures. 40,000 Notr. If it needs a third or fourth Ink Sack to stun everyone or to disappear in an inky burst go ahead.At this point we should hopefully only need one more even if the camp is alerted.

Two more Inky Festersacks to stun the PK and the Shadowhounds. 11 PK if we grabbed them all. 55,000 Notr.We can pull out here if we&#039;ve succeeded, we&#039;re not greedy.

If we can make some kind of dragon girl adoll with the human flesh lol. Maybe throw in Duoll to give her shadow powers for stealth? A Shadow Dragon Girl? I&#039;ll aim for that I think. Maybe she can fly, maybe she can just sneak really well and has enough power to protect herself. Dragonember, Human Flesh, Duoll, __ Anima. So we could gain access to the Pva/Bosom district to buy or steal some Milkore as Ambrosia. Which means money to bribe or buy a pass or figure out how to sneak in and out without getting caught. Or make some magical food with souls added in, which means we&#039;d end up killing people in some way. If the Shadow Dragon Girl works out I&#039;d probably try to have her sneak in if we can&#039;t figure out an actual way in. Or we could try aiming for the people who would not be missed to make this weird soul meal until we can get the Milkore.I&#039;ll have to think on it and hear from the fellows"

Would she be okay with some kind of Adoll arm so she could continue her duties as a warrior and protector of our bloodline? It could be a potent weapon if the Northsari survived to warn others. I believe the options were some kind of mimic, living wood or living metal, whichever would really help her as a warrior. Then precisely what materials she must secure whether thats in the wild or in the market and we can give her some Notr.&gt;Harvest Duuol (3x C.T.P, current radius: Waist district, select mode: Average)If we can get some flesh miners who were sleeping off some serious drinking and hangovers it could be confused with alcohol poisoning, or some tainted drinks, or they succumbed to some internal mutation as their kind do.Johanna&gt;Consider a different approach?I&#039;d like her to gather ingredients for her new arm, or just some stuff we will need if she wants to think on it. Whatever she can get from the Miner&#039;s house. He &#039;vanished&#039; with our Adoll Mudusa and hasn&#039;t brought the agreed payment, its our right to collect. He must have some ores, gear, notr, or something we can use as ingredients. If he had Maps of Tichelina, of the flesh mines, that could be very useful to us. If we can get his maps we might be able to use them to navigate up to the Bosom and get our own Milkore. Some gear. Make an Adoll to protect us or do it for us, it could be our solution to the Ambrosia."

Technically speaking, YOU should be the one recompensating the grieving family of the miner if you knew where he lived of course. It was a sad dead end for you. No, you would not attain what little riches the poor miner once had in his possessions.&quot;My missing arm? If restoring it would help me to aid you further, then I have no issue with it, my lord.&quot; At least she had agreed to that. She was sent to the inquire more about living metal/wood and of course any Ambrosia related tidbits.
