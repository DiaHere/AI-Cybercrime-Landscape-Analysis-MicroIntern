I like that for the baseline weapons everyone&#039;s on a similar level of ability, but then when you throw in the wacky powerup items the difference in ability is stupidly OP. Like I said I just won my first game because I picked some kind of mystic/legendary item allowing me to both fly and throw crows (???) and winning with that felt borderline unfairI kinda love whatever the fuck the storm beast is though, had this hilarious chase sequence the other day where this dude chased my car around the entire map while I desperately tried to flee"

        "text": "&gt;&gt;532203401In Factorio, the number of centrifuges needed to support a single nuclear reactor in the earliest stages of nuclear power depends on the uranium fuel cycle, specifically how much uranium fuel (U-235) is required to keep the reactor running. Let’s break it down:Key Assumptions for Early-Stage Nuclear PowerA single nuclear reactor consumes 1 nuclear fuel cell every 200 seconds.Each fuel cell requires 10 U-235 (plus other materials like uranium ore and iron plates).Centrifuges are used to enrich uranium by producing U-235 through the uranium processing recipe.The uranium processing recipe in a centrifuge has a 0.7% chance of producing 1 U-235 per cycle (and a 99.3% chance of producing U-238). Each cycle takes 12 seconds.Step-by-Step CalculationFuel Cell Consumption Rate:A reactor uses 1 fuel cell every 200 seconds, so it needs 10 U-235 every 200 seconds.This translates to 0.05 U-235 per second (10 ÷ 200).U-235 Production Rate:Each centrifuge produces U-235 at a rate of 0.7% per 12 seconds, or 0.007 U-235 per 12 seconds.Per second, a centrifuge produces 0.007 ÷ 12 ≈ 0.0005833 U-235 per second.Centrifuges Needed:To meet the reactor’s demand of 0.05 U-235 per second, divide the required U-235 by the production rate per centrifuge:0.05 ÷ 0.0005833 ≈ 85.71 centrifuges."

        "text": "&gt;&gt;532206175Gork. GPT says:In Factorio, the number of centrifuges you&#039;ll need at the earliest stage of a nuclear power plant depends mainly on how quickly you want to start and sustain uranium fuel production, especially Uranium-235, which is rare and needed for both fuel cells and later for Kovarex enrichment.At the earliest stage (pre-Kovarex):You&#039;re using the basic uranium processing recipe:Input: 10 Uranium oreOutput (average): ~0.993 Uranium-238 and ~0.007 Uranium-235That means on average, you get:0.7% U-235 per cycleOne fuel cell requires 1 U-235 + 19 U-238So U-235 is your bottleneck.Recommendation for early stage:At least 4–6 centrifuges running basic uranium processing is reasonable for a small, starter nuclear setup.This gives you a steady, if slow, trickle of U-235.Expect to wait a few in-game minutes to get your first 40 U-235 needed for Kovarex later.If you want numbers:Each centrifuge does uranium processing in 12 seconds.If you run 6 centrifuges:5 cycles per minute per centrifuge = 30 cycles/minuteAt 0.007 U-235 average per cycle 30 × 0.007 = 0.21 U-235 per minuteThat’s ~1 U-235 every 5 minutes, or 40 U-235 in about 3.3 hours of game time."

So they changed it from any quality on input into being 5 fucking different recipes.Before you could create one quality factory that you could upgrade any part of and anything downstream would benefit. You&#039;d make a better gear production that averages out to a higher quality and now anything that uses gears has on average higher quality output (or more of it if it&#039;s recycled below a certain qual).Now you&#039;d need to do five identical factories for everything and split every fucking thing at every fucking step because if your uncommon gear assembler makes a rare gear you no longer can feed it into anything uncommon down the line. Or anything common. Or epic. Or legendary.So most people say fuck it and upcycle. Upcycling isn&#039;t a good solution but it&#039;s better than actually trying to make a quality factory. The only difference is whether you choose to upcycle base ingredients or the end product.In fact, if you upcycle on intermediates you can hit 300% productivity on then it&#039;s strictly better than a quality factory because it just converts commons to legendaries 1-to-1 with just time, electricity and optionally fluids."

        "text": "&gt;&gt;531561145&gt;that VNThe most unforgettable horror porn game I&#039;ve ever played. No other game had a bunch of elementary schoolers gangbang a teenage girl against a wall. And the teenage girl loved it. No other game I&#039;ve played had a 17 year old bishonen guy drink a 14 year old girl&#039;s piss and chase her down the hall to rape her, only to wind up getting anally raped by a 32 year old fat man. I still remember the scene where a 16-17 girl was hiding under a bed as her same age best friend was having sex with that same 32 year old fat guy on top. She heard every moan, bed shake and sound. In the wrong end she was discovered under the bed by her friend and made to join. A most terrifying scene was when an unwilling girl relives another girl&#039;s sex memories. The girl in the memory consented but the reliving girl didn&#039;t. It didn&#039;t matter that she was mentally screaming, her body in the memory did all the motions and actions as in history. It&#039;s like mind control rape except the victim was fully aware. Another scene the same girl and a friend were almost raped in a magic sex ritual, saved by the girl&#039;s older sister, and the backlash made the older sister want to rape her younger sister and friend.The loli in this pic is freakishly lewd and once disguised herself as a teenage girl, fucked a boy until he nearly came, transformed back saying&gt;You thought you were having sex with a highschooler weren&#039;t you? I&#039;m an elementary schooler all along!And leglocks that boy, forcing him to cum inside her unprotected, when he screams in fear upon learning this. This isn&#039;t even getting into the tentacles, the gay sex, the lesbian sex, the incest, the sequel&#039;s mother/daughter lesbian scene, etc. The first chapter alone contains lots of lesbian sex scenes with an unavoidable girl masturbating in the bathroom. Truly horror is intrinsically connected with sexuality."

She goes &quot;Shall we take our relationship to the next level, then?&quot; Noah says yeah, then she says instead of going back to the castle he should spend the night with her in the forest.

She can shut down ONE target and burst them down but only basic bitch targets, no bosses either. She&#039;s purely a pvp unit.

Some of it is a bit weird and incoherent because it feels like there&#039;s a missed chapter, but here&#039;s what I&#039;ve got:Your group go to the island because of a rumor that someone who looks like Goldland was there. Get drunk, have a fun time. Take in Selena as a favor to Van Helsing. You meet Lorelei who is one of the Seven Sages who rebuilt the island after it got tsunamid and now runs the place. She acts weirdly friendly, especially to Ami, right off the bat. Get in some conflict with a rich kid. Hear rumours that there are man eating sirens running around at night. Spend the night at an inn, where Lorelei secretly starts a rumor that Ami is a Roland, for some reason (after earlier implying Ami is mega rich).During the night, everyone has weird dreams. The next day, Noah &amp; co. are &quot;invited to meet&quot; with Savich the elder, and for some reason go along with it even though surely they&#039;re strong enough to say &quot;fuck off&quot; (idk why). Selena goes to &quot;rescue&quot; them, not entirely sure what the whole deal with that was. Noah decides to investigate the whole sirens and disappearances thing, snoops around and finds crime scene illustrations and evidence which suggest a member of the Seven Sages is responsible — including a blackmail letter talking about some &#039;special slaves&#039; and threatening to tell the Church. Ami is approached by a Goldland lookalike who is one of the Seven Sages and a sketchy guy who is implied to have helped purge the island of remnants from the pre tsunami days, to build the new utopia. He says he wants Ami to join as an 8th Sage helping rule the island, and says she&#039;ll get amazing perks like special Black Blood slaves. Also says they&#039;re gonna extend their way of doing things to the mainland eventually, thanks to the amazing power of the sirens tear, which allows them to mindfuck people&#039;s dreams (and maybe more?). Noah and Ami go &quot;wow very cool we will think about it aha&quot;."

Church has also sent an official mission to investigate. Van Helsing has also gone solo to investigate, because it used to be his hereditary fief pre-tsunami, but anyone who knew him there would now be dead. He got captured though and has been rotting in prison, until he learned to speak mermaid and started a prison break of some kind. We see what are some childhood flashbacks or bad dreams of him and some other kids talking about sirens and dying in the deep. As of chapter 10, there&#039;s an auction to be the 8th Sage, and between chapters Noah has allegedly figured out who the person behind the disappearances is, and is laying a trap. He has also figured out the slaves are probably nearby and has sent Aiona to explore the most likely location (a sewer... while she&#039;s in bikini and barefoot... my wife is born to suffer) to free them, because I think he believes they&#039;re some kind of Landis semi-bloodborn things, sapient rather than blood beasts. He got Selena to have the Church guys make a scene as a distraction at the auction. Seven Sages think they now know who the traitor is. Old Savich is meeting with an actual Roland, it seems. Also Selene is a former assassin, and the based assassin&#039;s guild rep posing as a wine merchant made her wear a bikini because he&#039;s a true hero. Also drunk Aiona is cute, and Ami is a troll.That&#039;s where we are unless we pay for sunblock, which I&#039;m not doing until it&#039;s time to farm nightmare quick clears."

My girl didn&#039;t even shed that bad I think, but it still gets everywhere. If you guys sleep naked together, you will occasionally find that her hair has wormed its way up and into your asshole somehow. I still don&#039;t know how that&#039;s possible, but it happened a good handful of times. The first time it happened I was just in the shower washing, and I guess my hand &quot;caught&quot; the hair, and I felt it all the way up my sphincter, and I kinda paused and was just like &quot;wtf&quot;, but I slowly pulled it out, wondering &quot;what in the fuck is this&quot; and once it was all out I realized it was a strand of her hair. I stopped pulling long girl hairs out of my butthole after we broke up, so it was definitely her."

Make MSQ quests not give good XP so people are forced to fate grind to max like in ARR? No one wants to actually do that shit. Making all FATEs give bicolor gemstones which is a popular suggestion will not make the overworld populated either. No one will start doing fates in la noscea because they get gemstones for doing them. World Bosses already exist technically with S ranks and SS ranks but those are barely rewarding at all. I’ve played WoW:TWW recently and did plenty of world quests and they weren’t rewarding enough to do daily. I totally want to kill 15 mobs for 40 valorstones which will not barely get me a level on gear upgrades. In GW2 you do the same shit in each map. Go find the heart stones, go do the jumping puzzles, go discover these locations! It’s boring busy checklist work that is barely rewarding to do. What are you gonna suggest Bozja CE’s to replace overworld FATEs or something retarded someone has suggested a million other times?"

It&#039;s not impossible but no one actually recruits like this for it to be true 100%.2) You can do effectively whatever without any risk like that.3) Botting is rampant, but it actually affects the players very little. It does affect the players, but with how the game works, it affects very little.4) Download XIVLauncher, as it allows you to use plugins and is overall a better laucher.5) No need for alt accounts, everything is possible on one character, additional characters would just be for extra space, but the game is designed to where that space is &quot;effectively&quot; character bound, as you&#039;d need a friend to transfer items to that other character6) There&#039;s not really such thing as clans and they don&#039;t affect much. In some specific cases such as Frontlines PvP this is an issue, but even then you won&#039;t come across them often enough to worry. As a solo player you will be fine, but you will have to party up with other people for content, but that&#039;s only for brief periods.7) You do not need to join a static for the best gear, but it is helpful. You can use the Party Finder to do the hardest content with randoms, which works well enough just needs more effort.8) This game is almost entirely questing for progression and dungeon grinding for EXP.This game likely isn&#039;t for you though if you plan to do free-to-play, F2P doesn&#039;t let you go to max level or newer content, it lets you get far but not to the end.F2P will also prevent you from using things like the Market Board in order to sell stuff, or do trades."

You can solo things either with in-game bots or with real players, story content can be done if you know how to breathe and blink at the same time.To add, free trial is very limited to what you can do, but it&#039;s a good way to tell if you like the game or not, you cannot join any clans or even communicate, but you can do some stuff."

Most wouldn&#039;t change that much, but- Hisao would be less of a little bitch, relieved from his angst- Shizune would go through an adjustment period where she explored all the new ways she can interact and manipulate (for better and worse) people around her. Eventually she&#039;d settle into a new dynamic but be close to her original self- Lilly would change the most. Being suddenly aware of all the male attention and gaze that is on her, and seeing for herself how attractive she is compared to virtually everyone in Japan, she would lose control. Her spiking adolescent sex drive would leave her ill-equipped to handle this transition, and she would give herself over completely to flirting with boys for attention and evetually become a (semi-secret) slut. Naturally, her grasp on her classroom rep responsibilities would decline even further."

Smell develops MUCH earlier than sight, so by the time your brain starts to master vision, it&#039;s already had a lot of practice relating everything in the world to smell. And your emotions, of course, have a stronger impact on you when you&#039;re younger as well.&gt;&gt;531193492HA&gt;&gt;531235436&gt;&gt;531235658Very good posts.

As in, she wouldn&#039;t have ghosted Hanako and Hisao if that had meant leaving them on a desert island with no food or lifeboats, but she has no qualms doing so when she&#039;s going to deprive them of nothing but her company. It just doesn&#039;t register as particularly insensitive to her, and in a way that&#039;s fully understandable.Effectively, she&#039;s part angel and part devil, and very much a human being all in all, but her humanity comes across only once you sense and figure out her dark side.&gt;&gt;531227606Oh&gt;&gt;531247538Of course they would be sad and come to his funeral, but 2-3 of them would probably no longer be close to him 12 years after graduation.There&#039;s one or two fanfics with this specific prompt, I believe&gt;&gt;531233863Apparently it&#039;s not by Socrates and it&#039;s considerably more recent"

Of course our girl is nothing but simple but again, its understandable that she doesnt make some people click. I would never a Emi or a Shizune but those who would, good on them.

You roam around the world fighting monsters with a matching deck theme. PIC RELATED is me fighting a Rusted golem with an golem artifact deck. Then they drop hold and cards from their deck.There are also towns with shops that sells cards. (they&#039;ve even added a shop that sells card packs from specific sets, which wasn&#039;t in it last time I played).I think it has 99% of all the MTG cards ever made in it.I&#039;d recommend trying it. It&#039;s free after all. The only down-side I would say is it downloads the card art on the fly as you discover the cards, so if you&#039;re playing offline any new cards (and holy shit MTG has a LOT of cards) won&#039;t have art."

I do dig MTG but the fact of using hard resources just puts me off, making me wish i&#039;d be playing YGO instead. Not to mention how both times i put money in MTG, both times i ended up playing like once and never again and both times are to blame on the same person.&gt;You can get mana easily though.If so, why have it as a resource at all then, know what i mean?"

Then there are shops, like Kaiba-Corp toy store for accessories, Yugioh&#039;s dad&#039;s store to buy single cards (random offerings), and Pegasus Store to buy card packs.Then there could be tournaments, start out small at stores then big stuff like Duelist Kingdom and Battle City.Oh man WHY does such a game not exist?"

The Tag Force series does about all what you said and then some. You buy packs with the currency you get from duels, there&#039;s small storylines involving each character you meet in the game, there&#039;s also anime-exclusive cards that are playable, tournaments also take place, tag duels included and the best part of all &quot;dating sim mechanics&quot; You can increase your relation with characters by interacting with them, giving them gifts etc, earn benefits from it and team up for tag duels and such. I suggest you to look into those games, They started off in the GX era and ended around Arc V i think. For me, its Tag Force 5 since it runs on the format i first started playing the actual TCG and its, in my opinion, the best kind of YGO around, despite my dislike of Synchros.&gt;&gt;531572617Goodnight anon, dont let Akira kill you in your sleep."
