If you want to play the free version, I dont think anyone has put the effort to make a graphic pack for the 5x.xx since it has thousands of sprites now and the graphic part of the DF code went on a big overhaul. Where as before all that a graphic set needed at minimum was to match the amount of tiles for ASCII table, and at most they would have a few hundred tiles. So if you want to play with graphic sets you will be limited to playing 47.xx until we see some new development in this zone, wish I doubt will happen anytime soon if ever.(detail that graphics set != tile set, the later is a custom font for the ASCII table and you can still change that in 5x.xx as long as you pay attention to tile set resolution, because some of them dont work properly anymore)"

It&#039;s also possible that they cant ley eggs when the claimed nest box has eggs in it. Also forbidding the box from the dwarves might also bug it out and make them unable to lay eggs or even hatch.I did a test and let it run with only the use of the door forbidden while I fucked off and eventually it worked. I also learned that locking 8 turkeys up in a 6x6 room can lead to some nasty fighting. there was blood and vomit on the floor and the gobbler even attacked one of the poults.Also I realized you can bring next boxes as embark items so you can set this up day one.Since I&#039;m bothering to post all this, I have one more question. Does grazing inside with fungus after cavern breach have the same requirements as unirrigated indoor farming? Can you grow grazable fungus on stone like you can plump helmets and shit? I really like having one resource for meat, cloth, leather and milk. I think if they made a good sheep sim game I&#039;d play that instead."

Does the steam version give you that many extra points?I&#039;m still noob, but there&#039;s some ideas I have to improve it.Replace the bauxite with kaolinite. If other magma safe stone is found, it can make porcelain that from my brief experience can be worth 8 times more than a small cut gem (i still have to research gems, I don&#039;t know shit about what&#039;s possible yet, but my 1st year gems sell for about 40, I&#039;ve sold porcelain for 300.)If you want to shave points so badly you don&#039;t even take a pick, but take a copper bar just in case you have to make a bauxite and wood bunker and dig, why bring 1 unit of coke for 10 points? you can make a wood furnace and deconstruct it to get your ore back. It&#039;s not like you&#039;re going to be doing a hell of a lot waiting on picks anyway. Seems ridiculous. If you&#039;re bringing wood, maybe pick the lightest wood available, especially if you can use native wood and save the willow or feather wood for bins and wheelbarrows.Or bring the heaviest wood for shield bashing idk.Also, the author brings 50 sand? I get sometimes there isn&#039;t sand, but is glass really that good? And if he&#039;s exploiting it for cheap bags, why not bring wine for the extra barrel(s)? Finally there&#039;s no consideration for early strange moods. It&#039;s my understanding that you need to have 3 kinds of cloth (possibly as many as 5) uncut green glass (possibly 5, the articles aren&#039;t clear on this), leather (again, do you need 5?) and other things you can get by killing animals. I guess you can get leather by killing the guinea hens, and bones and skulls from the pack animals.

Same goes for some other stuff that comes with the default embark which can easily be sourced on site like buckets, stepladders and crutches, and the points for those can go in more iron ore and even flux stone for some of that sweet steel. Other than that, while cool, unless you have something partcular in mind or are RPing, I think the long term impact is minimal compared to the default gear.The biggest danger of this is actually mixing up or straight up forgetting to bring an amount of basic bootstrapping material, since if bring ores instead of axes you cant chop wood (previous versions allowed you to do that with trainning wood axes, but that is no longer the case), and whitout wood there is no coal to make axes. Similarly, is not having the right stones to usa to build a forge, a smelter and a wood furnace, meaning that you wont be able to do shit until the caravan arrive at the end of the year, and that is assume you actually deconstructed your wagon and used its wood for making a trade depot instead something unreversable like a bed.Another danger of this is that it will actually take about one or two months before you can actually start digging stuff, and in certain circunstances, like the possibility of an evil zombifiying weather, you really need to start digging ASAP."

In the absence of foes and in a wooded biome survival is pretty easy. The only reason I&#039;m having trouble is that for me the autism is the point. If wanted combat primarily, I&#039;d be playing something else. It&#039;s actually disappointing that many of these elements have little or no gameplay effect and are there for role play. I can overlook that as keeping my mind occupied is the goal and it&#039;s done that all evening and I didn&#039;t even play properly, just did some test embarks to confirm behaviors (leather milk and wool yields for different animals.)I think I&#039;m going to switch to sheep since you get twice the milk for about the same wool per embark point. It&#039;s also disappointing that there&#039;s no balance. Alpacas are objectively worse than the other 2. There&#039;s lots of things like this in this game, but again, it&#039;s not a deal breaker, just disappointing. But I&#039;m coming to the conclusion that none of this matters. I found a wiki entry describing how all you need technically is one anvil and one copper ore. I guess ash is technically a fire safe block? I do wonder if the starting points were originally 1000. They are 1504 when I zero out everything. This is the real issue with sandbox games. Since you can toggle everything there needs to be some sort of standard to make it challenging. Ironically, I keep restarting. I don&#039;t know why I don&#039;t just stick with the fortress and play it out. I think when the complexity is high but the layout is ugly I become unmotivated and want to start over. I recognize this is stupid as I can just go to another floor or corner of the map if I don&#039;t like it. But since it&#039;s a single player game, I don&#039;t really mind that I start over, or in this case spend all afternoon pouring over the wiki and forums to make trivial optimizations. As long as my mind is occupied and distracted from shit I can&#039;t do shit about rn it&#039;s working."

This game isn&#039;t designed for individual micro management. I mean, you can do it, but 5or 6 dwarves standing around waiting for a furnace and workshop to be built, 2 smelting jobs and then a picks to be made is pretty dumb. then you have to deconstruct it and move your anvil. Then having 7 proficient craftsman mining slowly and doing the jobs they aren&#039;t trained for while waiting on immigrants is also pretty lame. The guy also doesn&#039;t exploit for free barrels, but brings 50 sand. This is obviously for the bags. Why exploit halfway?It&#039;s also immersion breaking. I get that the point cost is a balance issue, but the caravans have weight limits, the wagon should too. Imagine 19th century gold rush prospectors went to the Yukon or whatever and instead of bringing picks and shovels, or even pig iron and coal, they brought unrefined ore. It&#039;s very stupid.I think the solution for me is just bring whatever feels realistic and challenging. As far as the skill points, I think that the embark portion of the game is really an afterthought. The random unbalanced nature of the starting attributes negates any kind of planning like this. It&#039;s better to just see what the dwarf is good at or inclined towards and spend the points in a narrative way.If this seems strange, it&#039;s my way of extracting maximum value out of my $26. If i spend and entire afternoon trying to prove the world gen is bugged, it&#039;s fulfilling my goal of distraction with an activity I wouldn&#039;t do after I get bored of playing properly.See you all for the next rant tomorrow or whenever.Posting here is also me extracting distraction value."

I wouldn&#039;t mess with the npp out of fear of messing up my system &gt;delete system32,lolor concern of what I&#039;m downloading with it resulting in decades of tech knowledge apathy and skill decay. I&#039;m not sure I could competently use DOSshell anymore without googling how. As I don&#039;t work in a tech field and I haven&#039;t played videogames much in the last 20 years (compared to the previous 20+) because they mostly suck, I&#039;ve become tech ignorant.&gt;illiteracyironic&gt;&gt;2088259It&#039;s the pro Ukraine shit. &gt;&gt;2088249&gt;you can do it in notepadYes, I realized that after I changed that one line. I ended up downloading vs studio instead of npp after a minimal amount of research. The hardest part was actually finding the file location for the steam version. I&#039;m not the tech person in the household, and this machine has several drives containing terabytes of &quot;fileshared&quot; data.Anyway, I&#039;ve been assured that there&#039;s nothing of value on this drive so If i fuck it up its no big deal, and windows 11 will have to be replaced soon on it anyway. Maybe It&#039;s time I learn linux or whatever. I hope I&#039;m done with waiting and distraction by then, but we will see.Now maybe I can actually play this game now that my dwarves are racially purified. I didn&#039;t think it would make a difference, but omg it does. Why so many shades of brown and 3 of white? I assume that &quot;1&quot; in the line is a measure of probability, making it so most dwarves are dark.I Just watched thishttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ttnk7gcOXUTarn (I assume that&#039;s toady?) is the spitting image of my cuck brother in law whose wife half his age blows arabs at the truck stop.

Right now, this affects procedural object generation, like the forgotten beasts, divine curses (vampires and werebeasts), divine items, necromancers and their lieutenants and experiments, evil weather, and so forth. For the last fifteen years or so, all of these things have been hard-coded in Dwarf Fortress, inaccessible to modders. Now the algorithms and data are available for modding. Scripting will come to encompass more hard-coded features of the game as we proceed.&gt;The relevant scripts establishing the vanilla procedural objects are in data/vanilla/vanilla_procedural. These scripts are structured in the same way as a mod, like the rest of the data/vanilla content, so you can use it as an example for your mods. The mod should have an init.lua file, but whether or not you organize further scripts and folders is up to you (the vanilla &#039;mod&#039; has a generators folder with several scripts and a few subfolders).General updates== Added lua scripting for procedural objects.== Fixed a crash related to personality testing of soulless creatures during conversation.== Made the legends mode creature list searchable by species and interaction name.== Repaired the &lt;&gt; buttons for Z switching after some strange behavior.&gt;Made the legends mode creature list searchable by species and interaction name.About fucking time you damned frog, now allow equipment search in arena mode again"

Which kind of sucks because the Warlord Era also enables the Revolutionary Activity event spam which blasts your militancy through the roof so you get a reform every 6 months until you become a Constitutional Monarchy - But that would suck anyway if I&#039;m stuck as a theocracy. Instead I&#039;m fighting liberal rebel spam even though my global militancy is below 1 (too low for my UH to allow reforms but individual pops of over 100,000 have 10 militancy). Basically it&#039;s just boring and I only want to play Taiping to watch gooks become good Christians."

The Christians are hard to play against and all the counties got respectable navy and tech. So alliances are much better.Next time, I&#039;ll do the Latin Empire or just before so I can play an interesting dynasty&#039;s beneficiary."

You and I, when a second passes, that&#039;s another moment of our life which we can never get back. For the Master and His angels, it doesn&#039;t affect them at all. For us we have to take it on faith the Master exists but for an angel they live in His uncreated light just as simply as the sun and moon rise for us every day. Yet somehow the main chief angel and about a third of the rest of them were so butt blasted about talking monkeys, they thought it would be a good idea to try and attack mighty Tengri who made and sustains literally all of reality. He whomped their asses so hard that He had to make a reality for them that&#039;s on fire. So, it feels bad to ask this but it makes you wonder are angels stupid or something. Compared to humans they&#039;re like gods from ancient myths but if you look at the source it just makes us seem even worse. Anyway, I don&#039;t know what you are asking but I hope that Tengri decides to favor you and your family with everything good."
