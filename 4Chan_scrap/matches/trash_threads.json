I just know they’re strict on women keeping their hair tied back, and dudes keeping it relatively short, and sometimes stuff with keeping facial hair clean. But that might be less important I’ll try to persuade a co worker to do itOn his own timewelp not in my lifetimeThe moment they set a “we give pokemon paychecks” precedent they’re opening a ginormous can of worms soyou better become a senator or something. Actually you better become like 300 senators at once. Yeah you’re basically a walking demigod now so ig I don’t have to give you advice about that Oh yeah that sounds easy peasy.

Aside from training and training related things, which is a hobby for all of them, Lightspeed likes to deliver stuff, Repose enjoys acting as a night guard even when we are in a safe place, I think he just likes patrolling, Inferno enjoys cooking and helps me a lot, Whisper likes reading and sitting in the sunlight-- preferably at the same time-- Dream enjoys dancing, Freedom likes being up in the sky with Cottonball, Fea, well, his hobby has mostly been his family lately, Tom likes to paint, and so on.Oh, and Star likes to meditate and read and help me with the money and planning and, well, everything.&gt;&gt;76477560&gt;&gt;76476991&gt;Inferno, Lightspeed, and Whisper, who seem to have gotten distracted in a conversation of their own, bring their attention back to the present happenings&gt;Lightspeed stands up, ready go to wherever, Whisper stretches and his leafy tail sways behind him as if blown in the breeze, and Inferno shakes himself, his fluffy coat being swayed back and forth with each shake&gt;Lightspeed is the only one who looks like he may have gotten bored, but then, he&#039;s Lightspeed&gt;Inferno turns to Whisper&gt;&quot;I know you&#039;d be fine with walkin&#039; but do ya&#039;ll want carried?&quot;&gt;The shy Leafeon wouldn&#039;t have asked himself, and doesn&#039;t seem to quite know if he does or doesn&#039;t&gt;&quot;...&quot;Maybe?&quot;&gt;&gt;76473310Does Flow have any good stories from the local Pokemon?

Imagine me squinting my eyes really hard at you right now.All of that makes sense, uh, though I don&#039;t really know if I react that much different that most people, but that sounds like the whole &quot;am I normal&quot; conversation we&#039;ve had several variations of at this point so, I&#039;ll just go with &quot;okay&quot; and we&#039;ll leave it at that. Unless you want me to, uh, defend my normalcy-- by the standards of Pokemon trainers-- again.Oh. That sounds reasonable, they wouldn&#039;t want hair getting in the way of, like, aiming and stuff, I&#039;d guess. Do the rangers not allow you to grow a beard?Uh. Let me know how that goes! And, don&#039;t mention me, in it.I don&#039;t know, I think it could already happen in some places, Ryme, Neos, maybe even Fiore! That can of worms has already been opened in a lot of places, heck, even Unova has hired Pokemon before, though mostly in construction, but some of them DO get paid! And some of the Pokemon Center Pokemon too! It&#039;s not that outlandish as to require all that, the world&#039;s already well on the way to that becoming how it all works.That&#039;s, um, a little bit of an overestimation there. And by a little bit, I mean, quite a bit. Now, maybe, all of us together at full power on a very good day with some friends/other advantages could take on a walking demigod and win, but that doesn&#039;t, uh, make any one of us one.I assume a demigod is, like, equivalent to a Mythical Pokemon but not a Legendary Pokemon.Do surfers and skaters overlap like that, most of the time? I&#039;d have thought the one hobby would always take priority over the other, so few would do both?"

        "text": "&gt;&gt;76473483Ok, thank you! To be honest I don&#039;t, uh, know if I even recall what we were talking about, aside from the whole chasing Pokemon thing.Thanks! Getting a picture of Star while she&#039;s using Swift in battle is, um, a challenge, so I had her just use it normally for that. It still took a few tries, and she had to slow the stars down from their normal speed, they were just too fast!If you benefit from it, then you are using it, and therefore, it is already upon and around you. That&#039;s not me, I can&#039;t do anything about that, that&#039;s just the truth.It depends on what those instincts are! Some things are better resisted, and being a better person IS a proof of power! We may just never agree with this.But what if some other Pokemon has instincts to chase you? That&#039;s not hypothetical, that&#039;s something that could happen. It&#039;d be fine though, right, as long as that Pokemon was following their instincts?Yuck. Even if they did, they wouldn&#039;t be textured like chocolate, they&#039;d be all slimy and gross. I can&#039;t believe you like the thought of eating eyeballs. What will people think when they realize you&#039;re an eyeball eater?When she&#039;s sleeping, I&#039;m sleeping, most of the time. What if you&#039;re sleeping? Should I wake you up instead?"

It&#039;s like that with society, if you are going to be part of a society for the benefits, you have to follow the terms and conditions. Not that I&#039;m going to be the one to enforce them, that&#039;s not my job, I&#039;m just trying to give you a heads up here that other people will feel that way and some of those people WILL try and enforce them, regardless of what you or even I feel about it.True, but they aren&#039;t chasing you with what seems like malicious intent, I don&#039;t think you are convinced that any one of them wants to hurt you. But if one was chasing you to hurt you, that&#039;d of course be fine as long as their base instincts lead them to do that. So I probably shouldn&#039;t help you if you ever get in that situation, is what you&#039;re saying? I&#039;m starting to understand. Though I think I&#039;ll only apply that logic to Pokemon who apply that logic themselves, with Pokemon who use different logic, I&#039;ll also use different logic, and help them out.So, if I put sewage on top of an ice cream, you&#039;d eat it? Noted. I&#039;m not going to do that, but, noted.Also the humans who cook eyes are WEIRD.Well, we&#039;ll see about that. I think I&#039;ve decided, I&#039;ll follow your morals when dealing with you, and I&#039;ll ask Star when it&#039;s anything else.&gt;&gt;76479977&gt;There&#039;s always time to learn a new skill! But maybe starting with the laptop and not a full BCI lol&gt;It does indeed, though he doesn&#039;t need that to earn the respect of at least the other Pokemon over time, it&#039;ll help!(And good morning!)&gt;That makes sense! That&#039;s similar to how Taner and Whisper play it too... though Whisper is really good at hiding, being the smallest target of the three playing that way½"

But I&#039;ve seen a lot of the world at this point and different parts of it are very much at different stages in this process, but I&#039;d say it seems to be heading in that direction in a general sense. I mean, even with so many Pokemon posting to the Internet-- I&#039;m sure that&#039;s not just happening here, and with that happening, don&#039;t you think people&#039;s views and attitudes about Pokemon are going to shift?

Since STAR reads everything, I’m sure it’s in HER nature to help her sisters in need, be whenever they are¡I said put on by ARCEUS, y’know the one that has put on everything else that is GOOD and TASTY. You’d be a pretty bad cook if you did that¡They are not MY morals, they are THE TRVE MORALS&gt;&gt;76494539It is simple DORO, when mons or hummies suddenly disappear I assume they died in a CAR CRASH EXPLOSION; until they show up again. Like the heroes in movies.... ＾▽＾It IS! Regret is the prime signal that you wouldn’t do something, since you’d feel bad ABOUT doing it later¡"

And, I do think, the time we were doing the gyms together in Sinnoh we didn&#039;t really have this happen much, so whatever the differences is, they end up being exaggerated when we only have text. Which is probably true in a lot of cases, come to think of it.That makes sense too, though, one has to eventually do their first co-op police mission. Are most of them boring, or do most of them end up being action packed? Do you look forward to them, when you get them?Politics always move slower than any other part of the equation, so I have no doubt that &quot;official&quot; change may lag a lot behind &quot;unofficial&quot; change in that direction, but I do stand by that it&#039;s going in that direction.Ok!I think I did. Wasn&#039;t there a VR POV movie of that? I remember I tried something like that at one point in one of those places that let you try VR stuff, and I, uh, didn&#039;t like it.I would bet money that he was a Pokemon trainer, for sure.&gt;&gt;76493494(Same! When Imigen5 is a thing, I&#039;ll try it with Phoxy!)See, yeah, that&#039;s the type of humor I&#039;m not good at, the whole threatening/mostly insulting the other person kind. You can go ahead and keep doing it, I know you well enough that you are probably getting a chuckle to yourself, but I&#039;m afraid I&#039;ll never really be able to give you anything much really as far as a response to any of that, I&#039;ve just... got nothing, here. And if any of it is coming from real annoyance with me or Star, which, I don&#039;t know what else you&#039;d mean by having a sliver of truth to them, I&#039;m really sorry about that, too. You know we&#039;re just going to keep on being ourselves no matter what, but, uh, if there&#039;s anything we can do to annoy you less, if you actually are feeling that way, then we&#039;ll make efforts to try!"

Just because you were born in the city and didn&#039;t leave it doesn&#039;t mean you aren&#039;t getting the advantages that being there instead of in the wild is, same as an advantage of being born now rather than, like, in the middle ages. Though the wild is basically still there, never moving forward in time, never getting better in any way, stagnant forever. Though I guess if you count the city as having been part of the wild before, there are parts of it that aren&#039;t stagnant, but when they move forward enough, they aren&#039;t called the wild anymore. Probably &quot;lawless land&quot; is a better descriptor than wild. But that brings us back to the whole point-- in a lawless land, the laws don&#039;t apply to anyone, but in a NOT lawless land, the laws do apply, to everyone. That&#039;s just a part of living there.I think that was a pretty clear line? I probably won&#039;t help you in breaking the law, or defending you from the law, unless it&#039;s pretty clear the law was in the wrong.I&#039;m sending who to you for what now? I didn&#039;t understand that sentence, sorry.I&#039;m not saying I won&#039;t, I&#039;m saying that, if I were to -actually- follow your own moral philosophy and apply it universally, I -shouldn&#039;t- help you when it comes to that. I&#039;m saying it&#039;s a good thing for you, if you ever get in such a situation, that I don&#039;t actually believe that anything done from base instinct is automatically good and okay somehow and I should just let it happen.I&#039;m just using that as an example of something gross, it&#039;s a good, working example!&gt;&gt;76512595We&#039;re always training! And we&#039;re always ready for a good battle, too. I don&#039;t think we&#039;ve had a training battle with Blazy before, only you, that&#039;s actually something Star and the others would be very interested in, if that&#039;s a real offer, we&#039;ll take you up on it!"

How about instead of a dance, they get a private chat with you? Then you can give them some hollow life advice that, since it came from their idol, they&#039;ll feel like it was the wisest thing they&#039;ve ever heard.Something like &quot;always follow your heart&quot; or whatever.Oh right, I&#039;m supposed to be there.Uhhh...

Again it was a bit of an adjustment for both of them since I hadn&#039;t genned them in so long, but... I think I got them looking close enough to the last time I genned them (and now the &quot;actually that&#039;s their look from a few months into the future&quot; explanation actually makes sense :P)&gt;lol probably&gt;Oh?&gt;&gt;76523530&gt;Ah.

Also, y&#039;know, it was mostly Ivy being Ivy&gt;It would likely make more sense for the older ones to be visiting than for them to go out, but maybe they went camping a few times once they were old enough (which for Taner is just normal sleeping in a tent lol)&gt;Proud but also probably a bit annoyed that his own kids are defying him at least a little lol&gt;But they all love their dad of course, and their entire family at that!

That it&#039;s a bit of both! He&#039;s learning to adapt, but also knowing when the glasses will be required, or not.

Even if the castle is way safer than the wild, there are still some questionable individuals roaming about...&gt;They both do, yes!

I think they realize it&#039;s safe to fight trainers like that when it wouldn&#039;t be for most other wild Pokemon. Maybe that&#039;s the other reason they do it? The risk of getting caught is less than the risk of, uh, a battle against another wild Pokemon? So they are basically trying to get some free training.As you say, there&#039;s probably a lot of different reasons! I really do have to find one I can ask, after a battle. Maybe I can try to just have Star ask for me. Or you!&gt;&gt;76524637&gt;Inferno held Foxparks style&gt;I have to gen that eventually, but for now have this instead(That&#039;s good, still probably healthy to have them off every once in a while)(That&#039;s also a good reason for it)&gt;&gt;76525183(That&#039;s nice!

Taner was planning to learn how to make it himself&gt;It does-- while some adventures are still a little much, like one of the recent ones in Galar, many of them at this point come at the request of rangers or someone else, and so they have a bit more warning for the more serious fights and can prepare (and have only those who are prepared there) accordingly&gt;That may not always be the case, but it is also the case that they have a lot more power these days, not just everyone being stronger, but with the backing of the League...&gt;It&#039;s one of the reasons Fea was willing to agree to allow the League to do testing and get the battle data and such from the kids, because now the League itself has a vested interest in keeping them in good health and unkidnapped, heck, if something like the ELG happened now, a champion or Elite 4 might even get involved&gt;I think you did! I can recognize both of them easily from these gens and I think they look great!&gt;Yes*4&gt;Yes, those type of scarfs&gt;That&#039;s good, and if he can do that without headaches, that&#039;s even better... the brain is very adaptable, so perhaps it&#039;s no surprise, even as a kid he didn&#039;t seem THAT disturbed by it, just very distractable&gt;&gt;76525557&gt;And probably has a corresponding move, too!&gt;It is just a little weird for a Fairy type to have a dragon type child, but perhaps thanks to being an Eeveelution, it&#039;s never seemed to cause a problem for Fea&gt;Nor did having a Poison type kid, for that matter, aside from the inherent Ivy-based problems that only had a little to do with type&gt;There was indeed, though, yeah, that... they were pretty young during that first thing, but Ivy was Ivy all while they grew up&gt;That makes sense!

I can, uh, comment on the ways in which we are different without implying that either one of us is weird for those differences.Or at least, I&#039;d like to be able to.That IS, in fact, a strange way to play a game, but I do think I&#039;d have a MUCH easier time playing a game like that, then being dropped into and out of the middle of a narrative, personally. But just because -I- wouldn&#039;t enjoy watching a movie like that doesn&#039;t mean I think it&#039;s weird you do!

Yes Taner all Pokemon are magical we know this already But that’s not within the same categorization of capabilities we were talking aboutBc no other Eevee has what she hasOr like any other being on earth be real hereI saaaaaid “try not drinking” And you said you will not try any of that Therefore You will not try not drinking That is how that shall be interpreted in the court of lawOkay well that’s not watching the movieThat is just watching clips of itI would get angry at anyone who says they “watched” a movie when that’s how they did itwhich is why earlier I specifically said I didn’t actually watch it, we just skiiiiimmed through cliiiiips. Idk why that’s bugging me but it MATTERS to meGet that into your brain It’s an action movieAnd every other second of it is fight choreography and cool stuntsIt is not very difficult to appreciate them without plot contextbut maybe that’s a personal thing so idk. It’s just when you say “watch” you’re clearly implying that you can’t personally commit commitment or investment in something you’re skimming through like that, but that’s not what I did at all either, so that shouldn’t be what differentiates us here.But yes thank you Star for the AI summary of Taner’s thoughts I get it now"

Being cruel isn&#039;t good and it isn&#039;t Fairy-like! Anyway, I don&#039;t believe that, I think you&#039;d be sad too if that happens, even if you don&#039;t want to admit it to yourself.At the very least, it&#039;d be the end of ice cream and candy and all that, because that stuff isn&#039;t found in the wild, it requires a functioning society to make it.No, the people don&#039;t have to force others into following them, most people will be following them by default, because it isn&#039;t like they are hard to follow, for most people. They have to find the outliers who don&#039;t follow them. I was just talking to Walker about this and he said most police offers and rangers end up being pretty bored.You can try to make your own money like that, but without getting people to agree it&#039;s worth something and take it in exchange for other things, it won&#039;t be very useful.No, I think the wrong laws are the expectation, rather than the rule, and it also depends on where you are, I learned the most important differences in the laws of all the League regions when I was in trainer school, but Paldea wasn&#039;t a League region back then so I&#039;ll have to do some study on that before I go there.Yes, and what I&#039;m saying is, that&#039;s a good base instinct to have, but not all base instincts are good, some people have the base instinct to BE the trouble for you instead, and do you think they should follow that?&gt;&gt;76548008That&#039;s fair, you know a lot more now, and know exactly what&#039;s going on when a Pokemon gets captured and how you&#039;d handle it. Still, I&#039;m very glad that -didn&#039;t- happen! Even though you&#039;d have been able to get away fine, I suspect, it&#039;d still be harder if you ever decided you wanted your own ball."

While I would say it&#039;s a minor-super power, I know there are humans that are like that, and I&#039;m pretty sure there are a lot of Pokemon that are too. Now, many of them may be, like, Alakazam or something, but not all of them. It&#039;s more of a &quot;mundane super power.&quot; Like the people who can sleep for only 5 hours a night and be just fine and awake and healthy, that&#039;s also a super-power.You, uh, really seem to have a strong desire to find ways in which we are abnormal, here. If you are looking for that, I&#039;m pretty sure Star&#039;s ability to learn those strange different moves is actually less common than having a really really good memory is.Oh.Well, I don&#039;t need to try not doing something I&#039;ve always not done, is how that worked in my own brain! I think I have a pretty good defense there! And if not, at least I know a good lawyer!I think a lot of people do that nowadays, watching clips from certain sites that show clips and never having seen the actual movie. To me, it sounds like watching a trailer of the movie. Then again, some trailers nowadays are practically the entire movie summed up, but that&#039;s a different topic.Okay, when I was thinking &quot;action movie&quot; I was thinking, like, Marvel, which does have a narrative even being an action movie, but it sounds like the narrative was a secondary thing here.It&#039;s in my brain now! It&#039;s not strange at all, it&#039;s perfectly normal, and I had the wrong idea about what you did, so there&#039;s no reason I&#039;d have trouble doing the same!Also, uh, it was me trying to talk like Star for that, but whenever I do that Star finds it funny so I don&#039;t think I get it right.Oh no, if it was an AI summery, it&#039;d have the strange middle em dash -- this thing. Which is not the way any human/Pokemon would do it, which is more like-- this. That&#039;s the proper way. It&#039;d also have the &quot;it&#039;s not just x, it&#039;s y!&quot; thing going on. AI&#039;s speak in a very strange way, but not like that."

People called them “autistic savants” for a reason, they literally have brains that allocated like 85% of their skill points into 1 perfect talent. Besides that though, no, that is like, only Star. If that’s a normal thing with some Pokemon then sure, who cares ig. And yes I acknowledge I keep doing that, my bad shit okay you win I’m gonna hurt my brain if I continue thisYeah the trend towards “shorts” has reeeally inflated the number of show/movie clips that get recommended and watched. And yes I’ll give you some credit, hardcore Henry is just way less plot intensive than even other action movies. It does have a narrative, but the point of the movie was to make a bunch of cool first-person action sequences, and so it does its best to focus on that.Okay this conversation’s wack bc I just screenshot an ai summary too. Funny.I uhh believe you, but I also don’t think I have enough AI experience to have seen that yet. I didn’t like, actually think that was ai. I was just poking fun of the way you translate her. Makin’ her sound like a robot. Who the heck says “nonstandard” in normal sentences yoI’ve gone way too far into the other end of the spectrum and now I say “like” in every other sentence as if I were speaking out loud its terrible and now you’re gonna notice it"

Overgrown grass, everywhere save for near the garden which is probably just to the side of the building with it&#039;s own path to it. The walls of the building are looking worse for wear.

She&#039;s able to memorize things very well. And I&#039;m not, so, to me, it seems all the more impressive. Star&#039;s often told me I&#039;m exaggerating. But she memorized the Pokedex... I don&#039;t know what else to say here. Maybe you&#039;re right. Maybe she is in fact a super genius like no other. That&#039;d be neat. I&#039;m always willing to say more nice things about Star!Okay!Yes. Can you blame me for thinking you were talking about something like that? I guess you can. But should you?Okay, that does make it make sense. I could watch those and be fine and enjoy them plenty, I just, wouldn&#039;t count it as actually watching a movie.It really stands out when you notice it. Also, if you ever correct an AI, &quot;that&#039;s a brilliant and insightful observation!&quot;I am known to exaggerate, and was purposely doing so in that case, but it still worked so maybe people should use &quot;nonstandard&quot; more often, it shouldn&#039;t be a nonstandard thing to say anymore! Oh no, that&#039;s something I do a lot too, I think as long as the person reading is reading it out in the other person&#039;s voice it&#039;s fine. It&#039;s fine on my end, anyway, I never notice when you do it.&gt;&gt;76562064Maybe, depending on what type of trainer you got.

Making something against the law doesn&#039;t stop it from happening, evil people gonna evil, but it DOES make it harder for the evil people to do it, and it does also make it easier for those type of people to be stopped, because there&#039;s actually resources and stuff to try and stop them!Maybe! Star wants me to say that she &quot;knows there&#039;s at one anon who&#039;d pay a lot for that 10 minutes.&quot;Okay! You do sometimes sound like a much younger Sylveon than Fea, from my perspective, but I suppose that may just be personality differences.Well, probably because their base instincts, being similar to yours, encourage them to make any Pokemon smaller than them fear them. And if they are really from the wild and not in a place where a law will make it so people try to stop them, they may also want to eat you, because that happens there and it&#039;s bad. But if base instincts are always okay no matter what they are, then I guess it&#039;s morally fine no matter what they do to you, so long as their base instincts are satisfied?I&#039;m, trying really hard to get you to see why my base instinct is that that&#039;s no good for anyone at all."

That&#039;s a lot of reasonability on your shoulders!I&#039;m sure there are too, and not many would actually be burning forests down.

Didn&#039;t you say that you think the Pokemon you chase have evil in their hearts, or something? I don&#039;t think your right about that, but still, you did say it. The law doesn&#039;t normally work to protect the baddies, and when it does, well, that&#039;s when the good people work to change the law! I have a friend I know who&#039;s doing exactly that.I, uh, don&#039;t know about that, I think, um, a costume like that would make it so I get caught too quickly...I told Star, and she just smiled and said &quot;that&#039;s fine.&quot;I, uh, suppose so.I like battles for sport and fun, and even for money, but battles when lives are on the line aren&#039;t good, I don&#039;t think anyone should have to battle for their life. Getting stronger is good so you can win if someone forces you to have that type of battle, or help others who are trying to battle for their life but might lose, but winning a battle only proves your stronger, it doesn&#039;t prove your better, morally, or in the right or anything like that, lots of bad Pokemon win battles.Our base instincts seem to conflict when it comes to this discussion, but we aren&#039;t having a battle. I guess we could, if I were to go to Pladea. Do you want to challenge me to a battle?"

It’s normal that it rubs off mons, something I’m trying to FIX. I think I’ve talked to your “mon lawyer” he is USELESS, and obviously there to leech off the system, couldn’t even get me a permit to burn all sylveons plushies.....Nonsense, it’d be an ICON for others to rally behind and join you in the hummie cleansing, but if you prefer a sylveon one I wouldn’t object.It’s called the CIRCLE OF LIFE, or what Tanner chan¿ you telling me you never ate meat¿ It’s all an Arceus given circle and plan, we are all just part of it¡I could take you on a REAL battle¡ and I’m talking me VS you, none of your other mons around to help you, that’d be CHEATING¡"

Any trainer who&#039;d catch you when you were actively trying not to be caught would have both pretty strong, but also not really considering your feelings on the matter, which puts them a step lower than most trainers in my book. Unless it was a version of you from a universe where you were actually trying to get caught, which is also possible...Yes, I agree. The potions are really good, but sadly limited.

If you limit my vocabulary with threats to do bad things just because I&#039;m trying to help, I won&#039;t be able to have a discussion at all, and I guess we&#039;ll just stop talking altogether? If that&#039;s what you want, just tell me, no need for threats... Though that&#039;s more of a threat that you&#039;re going to damage your own sovl just to spite me, like holding a knife to your own throat, but still, I don&#039;t want you to do that.Well, good luck with that.I&#039;m sure humans might burn down the forests too. Is that better?I think things only work when humans and Pokemon live in harmony. If they don&#039;t, chaos is chaos for everyone, if the world gets worse for one group, it always gets worse for every other group soon after. It just, becomes a worse world in general. I&#039;d like to aim for a better world for everyone, instead.Why do you think humans are so special? The only special thing about humans is that they are immune to Pokeballs. They certainly used that to their advantage when it comes to grouping together. They managed to build cities, that&#039;s impressive, but I think any group Pokemon could have also done it, if they had just banded together in the same way, perhaps being immune to the Pokeball really made all that difference, I don&#039;t know. But you seem to isolate humans as a special, different type of life than Pokemon. I disagree. Sadness can be traced to nature itself, the whole &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; thing is built to cause sadness, because then people/Pokemon will try to get stronger to avoid sadness.I have eaten meat, but I don&#039;t eat Pokemon meat. Again, I don&#039;t think humans and Pokemon are all that different from each other, the fact that we can even have this conversation is evidence of that, so eating Pokemon meat is about the same as eating human meat. Not great.No, my family is a part of my power, as I am a part of theirs, so we&#039;d be with each other in any battle of instincts."

It&#039;s a difference, if you define mischief, then you can change the definition, but if you define yourself by mischief, that&#039;s fine because mischief isn&#039;t b-- negative, on it&#039;s own.I think, we can just throw this whole line of conversation by the wayside, to be honest, it doesn&#039;t seem, uh, productive.Hmm. Well, good luck with that.I think, calling humans the root of all evil, is giving them far too much credit. You are acting like they are minor gods or something. They, uh, don&#039;t have any more control over the universe than most Pokemon. Not that they don&#039;t bare some reasonability for the world being the way it is, as a whole, they do... but Legendary Pokemon have much more reasonability than even that.Getting into a Pokeball isn&#039;t that big of a risk, if it&#039;s a friend ball. I don&#039;t think a mon-run society would be that much different, though whoever gets the second try is going to learn from the first, so. But that&#039;s already happening too, in places like Neos and Ryme and such, where Pokemon are considered equal parts of society. You know they banned Pokeballs entirely in Ryme? Actually, that&#039;s one of the reason Star and I haven&#039;t gone there... you cant transfer there with Friendballs, like we normally would.Yeah, it is. If that wasn&#039;t a choice I had, I don&#039;t know where I&#039;d be.

I guess I can&#039;t really hold that against you.It&#039;s not something I&#039;ve seen before, it&#039;s, um, a very distinct style of clothing. But agreed on the name. I hope people who know what it&#039;s called don&#039;t get the wrong idea. And yeah I suppose I&#039;ll ask her once I&#039;m a woman again so she can get my measurements if they end up different from last time, but hopefully they&#039;re the same. Illusions could be a backup plan, though I&#039;d worry about accidentally dropping the illusion in the middle of a dance or something and revealing I&#039;m not actually wearing anything...Um, yeah, wouldn&#039;t want that... though it might be useful practice for the Z-move dances, even if they&#039;re pretty different. I suppose having it as a skill couldn&#039;t hurt, anyway.That too!Oh? Interesting... alright, should be easy enough. I think we got the whole thing planned out! But... it will wear off, right?&gt;&gt;76592923(Goodnight Taner, feel better!)&gt;&gt;76593041You&#039;re talking like it&#039;ll be gone for good!Don&#039;t kill Celebi or Dialga, I can&#039;t imagine good things happening from that.Huh, really?
