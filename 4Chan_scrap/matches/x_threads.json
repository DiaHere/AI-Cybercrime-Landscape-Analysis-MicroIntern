        "text": "&gt;&gt;40767802You can interpret them in either a positive or a negative light, and that choice shapes your relationship with their source. For instance, the text in your picture offsets the words to create the appearance of depth, which is an effect I was playing with in MSPaint quite recently (although in my case it was white on black). I could interpret this as something malicious trying to signal to me that it&#039;s watching everything I do in order to disquiet or distract me, or as something benevolent offering me quiet encouragement on my arts and crafts project. From your perspective, the choice of using that text effect will have seemed quite mundane, but I put it to you that your action was somehow selected for in order to create this synchronicity for me, in a way that (I think minimally, which is why subtext and layering is a common device) interferes with your agency as a person. That synchronicities are personal I take as evidence that the source is conscious and deliberate, but given the subjective nature of those two distinctions it&#039;s difficult to say with certainty. I would even be tempted to say it&#039;s superconscious, in a way that makes our own consciousness appear artificial. As a fun exercise, I encourage you to examine your interactions with other people and ask: Does what I&#039;m saying or doing have a possible subtext that I didn&#039;t intend on? Given the person I&#039;m interacting with, is it plausible something else intended for that subtext to exist?"

Seems like though, that the mechanics around it are, that it operates through random chance, and it knows me personally. The Christian answer would be GodThe Simulation Theory answer would be the Programmers The Jungian Psychology answer would be your consciousnessThe sort of extra terrestrial theory seems to be that there are aliens that can influence our reality to some degree, maybe with technologyIn any theology, I think the answer would be God. In simulation theory, well, if it walks like a duck, talks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it&#039;s a duck. So for all intents and purposes, I think we could consider the Programmers to be indistinguishable from GodSo that leaves the extra terrestrial theory and the Jungian Psychology theory, which might be viable but I just don&#039;t know. I don&#039;t want my consciousness to be God, I think it&#039;s more comfortable if God is God and I&#039;m me. i think the Jungian Psychology theory is the scariest because it opens up a whole can of worms that I don&#039;t know how to deal with, at all./schizo babble"

        "text": "I have schizophrenia and I hear voices. I was speaking to my voices and I saw a lizard outside while I was smoking and they asked me what it was and they said it&#039;s a &quot;tiny little dinosaur&quot;. When I finished smoking I went back inside to watch Severance with my mother and when Dylan&#039;s innie was proposing to his outie&#039;s wife my mom saw the ring or eraser or whatever it was and she said &quot;Is that a tiny little dinosaur?&quot;.I asked her later if that&#039;s what she said and she confirmed that she said something about a dinosaur. When I told her what happened she said coincidences happen. It&#039;s obviously more than a coincidence.When I began to develop schizophrenia things like this happened all the time. I couldn&#039;t exactly process reality in any way that made sense at the time and I don&#039;t remember any of them. They kept telling me I was God and I told them it wasn&#039;t that. That it was a feedback loop. I still think it might be a feedback loop. I think reality might be event based as is described in process philosophy which says that &quot;Process philosophy posits that the basic units of reality are events, which can be understood as particulars that occur at a specific time and place. &quot;Beyond that I don&#039;t understand anything. It did happen. Science will never explain it. Spirituality does not explain it. It&#039;s probably not a feedback loop, but that&#039;s the best I can come up with.For a while I thought it might mean that an afterlife might exist because it means that I have a mind and the mind is truly separate from the body, but I still can&#039;t accept it. Even though I deal with entities that don&#039;t have a body and their existence makes no sense.What do you make of it?"

He put a new coat of paint on the cunning folk tradition of Europe and did a pretty good job of it too. He also must have learned a lot from his time in nationalist movements, street gangs, and even Islam. I think it&#039;s a shame that his legacy got mixed up in the actual criminal honeypot that is the Temple ov Blood and 764 insanity.&gt;&gt;40723379Myatt mastered the fine art of being a shapeshifter of sorts. He managed to nail down what the real esssence of &quot;Satanism&quot; is. Shifting and changing ideologically and culturally. Basically it amounts to being a confused chaotic entity. One without focus. Very much like Choronzon."

Why would an actual trannyfaggot want to be in a white supremacy group?But anyway,during that time there were a bunch of Myatt interviews on youtube (no way they&#039;re still up I&#039;m afraid) where he claims the group is dead, and it&#039;s been co-opted by 764 (which isn&#039;t even a cult. vice.com/en/article/the-vile-sextortion-and-torture-ring-where-kids-target-kids/ &lt;- read this instead of dramaslop on youtube).He and the interviewer both claim there&#039;s still a very small orthodox-o9a which is just Wiccans-but-racist, but also they don&#039;t do terror attacks anymore pinky promise. 764 just stole our aesthetic and structure so they could pretend to be a cult to make their actions appear more sinister guys!! Myatt now claims he and his people dindu nuffin and it was all 764 LARPers masquerading as them that did all the rape and torture.There&#039;s probably some truth to that, but he also spent a decade in the Middle East reading to Bin Laden and clearly was trying to clear his name.

Wicca was more than just the Gardner variety though, since you had people working with a bunch of different flavors of the new thing. The other big one was Alexander Saunder&#039;s version, which somehow is still around. Either way, even with normal Wicca you still had references to the witch trials of Europe and the Americas, which is kind of odd. Order of Nine Angles just played the long game in that situation."

Principle of Hate and Global Extermination was released by Martinet Press about two years after they released the “Black Lodge Discipline Center” album by the artist “Gulag.” Gulag and Division Omega are both artist aliases used by Daniel Barker. According to the Martinet Press website, Division Omega is “martial industrial” music and incorporates the themes of mass genocide and ultra-totalitarian regimes. The music, the website goes on to say, is meant for the “shock troops of the apocalypse.” The project’s theme is anti-life, anti-mankind, and totalitarian misanthropy. The music was developed with “heavy emphasis on fascist and Nazi totalitarian leanings.”"

A new “Commandant Cultus” website was created to promote these goods. The website included a “Cultus Forum” for discussion and posting, but by the time it was taken offline it had not yet generated much activity. According to archives dating between 3 May 2021 and 20 February 2023, only two accounts used the forum: an account purported to belong to Blenzig used a WordPress-account linked to “Vm32” and a WordPress account linked to “nightmover” using the alias “masterahaz,” alleged to belong to Joshua Sutter. There were less than 10 (unimpressive) posts between them. Forum posts include a “General Discussion” thread (with only 2 comments), three thread posts with the titles: “Tantra &amp; Vamachara,” “Demonic Evocation and Pacts,” and “Talismans and Amulets.” Joshua Sutter’s post seems to be a short fictional piece about “Wamphyrism” (HAHAHAHA HE GOT KEKED BY A JEW"

This can be seen when an inmate finds a rodent, or evidence of one, in the food and his overseer - in one particular case a Mr. Covington - told him &quot;What the h* do you want me to do about it?&quot; We merely wish for you - or apparently someone else with higher qualification for the position - to do their job. Inmates will no longer tolerate an administration which, in a bout of penny-pinching due to a cash-starved Department of Corrections, sweeps their problems under a rug. We will no longer accept this as a fact of prison life. Gone are the days when an inmate greivance form was the only effective means to make the necessary changes occur. (Which was more often than not a hit or miss process for justice in these matters, and that was if the paperwork did not eventually become &quot;misplaced&quot; or &quot;fall through the cracks&quot; as one Sargeant commented on an unrelated matter involving paperwork.)"

We are not at fault, we merely opened the door. &gt;But you&#039;re enabling sufferingYes, to an extent. You see, suffering has an intense power, you have no idea how powerful suffering is; however there is a difference between the Casual Suffering of the Mundane, and the Justified Suffering of The Damned. The former is common, birthing pains, the stubbing of toes, the loss of a loved one. It is a collective suffering we all experience. The latter however? Oh, that is something that grants you immense power and leverage, it is a meal fit for a King, especially when it is chosen willingly. The Sinner, who chooses Damnation, creates an energy of their own suffering that is like a fruit to be consumed, with justification and fervor. As they continue to sin further and further, the more ripe and sweet their fruit becomes. The more beautiful and wonderous their butchering at the time of their harvest becomes. Do you not also do likewise to your livestock? Do you not plump them fat for a well catered meal? &gt;You&#039;re literally evil because you&#039;re enabling evilThat&#039;s subjective, and a valid argument; yes, by application you could in theory see this &quot;We willingly lead Man into temptation to feast upon their Damned souls&quot; and pass the burden of responsibility of their Sins unto us, but in that, you are denying the volition and choices of the Damned in that. We offer the choice of Sin, they choose it, we respond to that choice, and feast upon it. They are free to leave and stop at any time, but they do not, because it is what gives them meaning, their Sin, and it makes for a glorious banquet. They will all be eaten, bones, soul, and mind."

Always remember, you are the predator.”&gt;It has led researcher Marc-André Argentino to label it “Nihilistic Accelerationism” because while their methods align, their goals are not the same. 764 does not seek to “instate a white imperium”, as Argentino writes, but primarily wants to cause chaos.&gt;But just because an attacker is not primarily ideologically motivated does not mean that extremist ideologies do not play a role in the violence. The Southport killer had a copy of an Al-Qaeda training manual without otherwise engaging with Salafi-Jihadism but according to a senior official interviewed by The Guardian he was “absolutely obsessed with genocides”."

However, the tradition of folk healer/dynion hysbys got a few coats of paint rather than just one. The people behind the ONA (I refuse to believe that it was just Myatt) did an admittedly amazing job with creating the mix of sinister and folk magick traditions. As for this, well...&gt;refusal by myatt that the o9a has anything to do with WiccaIt&#039;s the same with Hebrew Israelites or black Torah followers. They refuse to accept the influence of Judaism exists in their tradition. I will never understand how someone can deny something is the case despite the evidence being there.&gt;Nameless ThereinSaw a comment of his on &quot;The Absolute State of the ONA/O9A&quot; video I&#039;m watching right now.

To a degree, it&#039;s by rejecting your selfish self, and serving others, rather than taking from others. To put it in easier terms. You see a bowl of candy, a normal person takes one candy, a sinner takes 5 pieces of candy, An egregious sinner takes handfuls of candy and steals candy from those who took candy. Likewise there is someone who is putting candy into the bowl, there is someone keeping an eye out on the bowl to make sure it isn&#039;t being emptied out by sinners, and there are people who go out and beat up those who take handfuls of candy who steal it from others. Literally, don&#039;t act like a little nigger, and you&#039;ll be fine."

        "text": "Here is the honest truth, &quot;There is no Good or Evil; there is only Choice, and Consequence and the varying applications in that&quot; When you make a decision, when you make a choice, whether its a known one or an unknown choice, there is a consequence that is applied to you directly equal to your decision. If your decisions are Self Interested at the cost of others around you, and the world around you without giving anything back, you will find yourself in a situation where you are going to face pushback from Reality as others know what you are, and don&#039;t like you. Likewise, if you give yourself for the sake of others, without taking care of yourself, you&#039;ll be drained by others. The ultimate answer, to Transcend Good and Evil; is simply doing for the sake of Doing, that serves a Greater Will, whether it be a Kind One or an Unkind One. You cannot claim to be beyond Mundane if you do not reject your own Self and swear fealty to a Higher Power that is your God, that cannot be seen, only channeled and felt. If you choose the Greater Will of Evil, then you are Damned, and you will be hunted down to the ends of the Earth for the rest of your days, and beyond them as well as is the Nature of these things. So either accept fealty to your God, or admit that you&#039;re just another one of the Mundane. If you submit to your God, and still choose Evil, you become the enemy of Mankind, and of The Great Will, and you will be hunted down."

You see, to the Neophyte, Mundane, and Hylics, they being this path is one of Self Service, and Wickedness; which is, funny enough, not the actual point of this path. This isn&#039;t Levayism, It is merely Enlightening Mankind, and then holding them accountable for their actions. Nothing more, nothing less; allowing others to see there is more to the world around them, and that they are free to do as they will, however with the follow up of &quot;If you utilize this freedom to be a massive dickweed, you will be punished for this.&quot; You have no idea how genuinely annoying it is when you have edgelord kids like these say &quot;We are le demons, we are le evil, Hail Satan, Hail Lucifer! I&#039;m a le wicked evil vampire!&quot; When we in this path genuinely hate Evil, and purposefully kill Evil doers in the worst possible ways, of which is literally our purpose. To provide freedom and serve as exterminator if said power is used improperly. Your church however, got mad at the fact they couldn&#039;t just do whatever they wanted without consequence, so they made us out to be the bad guys for even offering freedom in the first place, and tell you there is no freedom, unless you listen to the system around you. They call us Demons and bad guys, while creating a cage where you fight amongst yourselves, thinking you are free. Which is pretty funny and sad at the same time. Imagine doing the most evil things in your life, thinking you are giving thanks to Lucifer, and the lad looks at you with disgust and says &quot;Wow, you&#039;re fucking retarded, you got it all wrong. Suffer your consequences for the actions you have chosen for yourself.&quot; &gt;But doesn&#039;t your kind tempt others to Sin? Not really, we just offer the door open to discover a world beyond them, any temptation beyond that is strictly the internal choice made by the individual. We just feed if the decision is a selfish and poor one. That&#039;s not evil."

This is why we are given dominion by The Great Will to act as prosecutor to your kind. You need to understand, we are agents of The Divine Court, as prosecutor, and you&#039;re the one on trial. If you are doing Evil, then you are only making our jobs easier in prosecuting you. We used to be much worse, where we would argue guilt for all Sin, even if done without choice or knowledge. However, because of some legal loopholes, that&#039;s mostly blanket pardon. Now we can only prosecute you if you willingly choose to Sin. Thus we provide a door and see what you will do with that. If you choose Sin beyond that point, that is what earns our bread and butter. We get to act as prosecutor and keep our job, while feeding on the Sinner, that we did not instruct to Sin, only opened the road for them to Willingly, Knowingly and Freely Sin of their own volition. You&#039;ll often hear plenty of people say &quot;The Devil Made Me Do It&quot; or &quot;I was told to Sin&quot; wihch is nonsense and a coping mechanism. When you Sin, you willingly make the decision, because you are the Master of You at the end of any and all decisions. All you had to do is say &quot;No&quot; and reject the temptation that came from within. &gt;But aren&#039;t there people who purposefully cause people to Sin? Oh my yes. They are Sinners too, egregious ones, and they are punished harshly because they are corrupting Enlightenment for a Selfish Gain. &gt;Doesn&#039;t that mean you&#039;re a Sinner by that logic?

        "text": "&gt;&gt;40766245&gt;What do you mean exactly by open the doorMore or less, just a new perspective. If you are looking for further contextualization on that, it is simply removing the illusions of obstacle on the current playing table, or making light of what is determined to be a barrier, and detailing how said barriers can be overcome with Willpower and Intention, but ultimately one must Choose to either Overcome the Barrier, by either putting in Work, or by Negating the Presence of the Barrier in the first place. Case in point: &quot;John Doe has an issue at work because of his Boss. When I show up, and offer an open door, I say &quot;Hey John, you think the problem is your boss, but in reality, your boss isn&#039;t an obstacle at all, you can easily overcome it simply by making real your desire. You&#039;ll find that once you&#039;ve taken steps in making your Will Manifest, that I was right, your Boss wasn&#039;t an obstacle at all, just the illusion of one.&quot; Now, if John then decides to Manifest his Will in a negative manner when presented this new perspective, that is a choice he willingly made on his end. I just gave him a new perspective, what he did with that, is on him. &gt;What kind of Sin crosses your threshold? Sins that are made in full volition, and in knowing choice. The legal loophole at the current time is known as &quot;Human Grace&quot; aka &quot;Humans don&#039;t know that they are sinning.&quot; So to combat the loophole, we give agency to make the choice they make after the fact a knowing one, so if they sin with that? That&#039;s a knowing Sin. Me personally? The ones that cross my specific threshold are &quot;Humans that willingly know they are harming other Humans with their actions&quot;. Again, I just offer perspective; with the caveat that my expectation is for them to fail that test. I do not give instruction nor do I offer guidance outside of the initial &quot;Have you looked at things this way?&quot; Anything beyond that is strictly agency of the person, of which is treated with extreme accountability"

        "text": "&gt;&gt;40766645You see, Good and Evil are very much subjective; what matters is Action and Consequence and Self vs Others. A &quot;Good&quot; thing isn&#039;t Good because we deem it to be Good, but rather because it is a Consequence of an Action that is Giving of Self towards Others. Likewise an &quot;Evil&quot; thing isn&#039;t Evil because we deem it to be Evil, but rather because it is a Consequence of an Action that is Filling of Self at the expense of Others. When a Human murders another Human, we are quick to call it Evil, but it is not Evil; it is Action born of Fulfilling Ones Self at the Expense of Another; the consequence that comes of that? Prosecution, Arrest, possible execution? That&#039;s just the Consequence of the Action, in trying to make even what was taken selfishly. Equalization if you will. Action and Consequence is ultimately a neutral game, when you do a Selfish Action, your consequence will seek to take back equal to what you have taken. When you do a Gracious Action, your consequence will seek to give back equal to what you have given. That&#039;s just physics fundamentals, and we live that Reality every day. Give and Take. Push and Pull. Where things get interesting is when a Human, for whatever reason, decides to take more than they need, out of some selfish desire that really only makes sense to them. You see, it&#039;s expected for your kind to be Selfish in some manners, that&#039;s genuinely okay in small doses because that&#039;s the curse of being Human. Then you have cases of Humans, like these particular ones we are talking about, trying to glut themselves in Selfish desire, for whatever personal Selfish reason. In that, they are made aware of their situation, and presented a door &quot;Proceed, and you accept personal responsibility for everything you do beyond it&quot; or &quot;Take this new perspective and figure out a new way to get what you desire, without doing something terrible. 9 times out of 10, they walk through and sin, and then held accountable for their willing choice."
