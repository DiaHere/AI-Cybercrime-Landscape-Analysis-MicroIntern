They get around it by making herbivores more viable. In Ecos:La Brea the bison is actually fun to play because it&#039;s the strongest animal in-game so far. You can kill a dire wolf in one hit. &#039;Points&#039; are easier to get as a herbivore, there&#039;s migration mechanics &amp; the map is big enough to avoid preds, even on a full server.Basically what I&#039;m saying is the animal survival game of your dreams /an is on Roblox."

I thought it would be cute to have it sitting up and using its forelimbs to manipulate chunks of meat and severed limbs like a typical squirrel, but then I&#039;m not sure if that behavior would carry over.Squirrels do that shit because they typically eat small portable meals, while a predator like this would most likely kill and eat things as big or bigger than themselves, not something they can just hold in their hands. That stuff would be better pinned to the ground. Also I wonder if the larger more muscular size would make it inflexible. I mainly want to have it eat something while sitting up like a squirrel to further distinguish it behaviorally and physically from a large cat, which it is evidently based on partially through convergence, but again idk if it makes sense for it to be doing that. Lmk what you guys think. Also, please talk me out of giving it a giant claw on its semi-opposable thumb and ripping off the marsupial lion."

Mostly because it literally doesn&#039;t matter, it&#039;s not exactly killing them, and the number of mutations needed to eliminate a behavior that is highly conserved in all rodents makes it unlikely. Even with altered limb structure and reduced dexterity, a predatory rodent lineage would likely still attempt some form of &quot;sitting up and manipulating food as its eaten using the forelegs&quot;. Just on principle.Or to be a faggy adaptationist, because it lets them strip meat from bones faster so they have fewer problems with thieves and are less likely to be prey while eating.

        "text": "In 2010, Martin A Nowak, Corina E Tarnita and the late Edward O Wilson published a landmark paper on the evolution of eusociality.In it, they point out that every known instance of eusociality occurred in the context of defending a relatively high-investment nesting- and occasionally feeding site.Amongst mammals, this is known to have happened twice, with Heterocephalus glaber and Fukomys damarensis.Both species tend to feed on roots and tubers, and are specialised for digging, creating huge underground networks in which to dig, feed and breed. They also possess peculiar adaptations to deal with low oxygen- and high carbon dioxide concentrations underground.Unfortunately, it is unlikely that either species is made to last since inbreeding rates are sky-high. Something all eusocial species without flight capability tend to suffer from.But all of this brings up an interesting speculation. Lystrosaurus lived in the late Permian and early Triassic. Lived through an era of low oxygen concentrations. Had adaptations for burrowing/digging. Some possessed tusks that could&#039;ve easily fulfilled the same role as Heterocephalus glaber&#039;s enormous front teeth.None of this HAS to result in the evolution of eusociality, but the conditions to enable it were assuredly there.There is a timeline out there where one, or perhaps even several, species of Lystrosaurus became eusocial, explaining their staggering abundance in the early Triassic, only for inbreeding to render them extinct again after a few million years.Maybe it is our timeline."

I am working on a very soft-scifi post-singularity-collapse type setting and I am wondering, what would a creature that dwells in magma look like? Yes I am aware no biological creature on earth can survive in magma but if you had to design one what sort of traits would it have? Metal scales like that one abyssal sea snail? Leathery skin of a particular color? Glassy chitinous exteriors? Would it just be like a big crystal? I&#039;m less looking for a detailed rundown and more to hit whatever notes would make a speculative biologist &quot;feel like&quot; it would conceivably fit into a magmatic environment, even if it is an absurd premise if you really think about it. Like for example if you wanted to design a deep sea creature the &quot;notes to hit&quot; would be bioluminescence, unhinging jaw, lures, either very small or very big, something something volcanic vents, you know. What would be the theoretical aesthetic key points of a magma-dwelling creature?"

Got this:Hydrotherimys abyssoratus - “abyss-burrowing water rat”Earth’s surface is mostly uninhabitable: a hyperarid supercontinent under a brighter sun, with low oxygen and high CO2. Mammals are nearly extinct, but this massive capybara descendant survives underground.It lives in deep aquifer systems beneath the continent’s interior. About 2.4 meters long and 300 kg, it’s built like a cross between a capybara, a tank, and a mole rat. It has a flattened, armored skull for digging and keratinized scutes covering its back and tail. Eyes are vestigial - it relies on electroreception and subsonic vibrations to navigate.Colonies are eusocial: one breeding queen, dozens of sterile workers. Communication happens through chemical trails and low-frequency pulses. They construct complex tunnel systems, complete with heat-exchange vents and mud siphons to manage water during dry centuries.Their metabolism is adapted to low oxygen, using sulfur-based anaerobic respiration. A modified colon functions as a buoyancy organ in flooded tunnels. Diet consists of root starches, chemosynthetic algae, and decaying fungal mats.The tunnels host a full biome: glowing fungi, parasitic arthropods, eel-like predators. They&#039;re hunted by blind, python-sized worm-lizards that track body heat.Hydrotherimys isn’t intelligent, but its hive-level coordination and ecological influence make it one of the last successful mammalian lineages - a relic from Earth’s warm-blooded past, surviving in darkness beneath a dying sky."

As the sun brightens, the planet’s orbital and axial changes trigger frequent hyper-glacial periods. Most surface life clings to equatorial refuges or sub-ice ecosystems. But turtles - absurdly resilient survivors - have taken an unexpected path.Glacioscutum is a descendant of softshell turtles that colonized geothermal fissure lakes under ancient polar ice. It&#039;s now a deep-subglacial aquatic specialist. Around 1.8 meters long, it has a broad, semi-transparent carapace with embedded antifreeze glands and bio-optic cells to absorb faint geothermal light.The skull is elongated with a retractable siphon snout - used to inhale warm, mineral-rich microbe plumes from hydrothermal vents. Jaws are adapted to filter mats of extremophilic bacteria and sulfuric biofilms. The limbs have become paddle-like and end in cartilaginous hooks for anchoring against currents.It breathes both through lungs and highly vascularized throat tissue - a holdover from earlier aquatic turtles - and can enter torpor for months during energy shortages.Behaviorally, it’s solitary, slow-breeding, and shows minimal learning capacity - but its biological efficiency is unmatched. Eggs are laid in silica-crust domes near warm fissures and left to incubate in geothermal heat.Glacioscutum has no eyes. Instead, it detects pressure, temperature, and faint bioelectric fields. Its only real predator is a blind, eel-like scavenger that tears open weakened shells during nutrient crashes.Despite a billion years of change, this turtle remains what it always was: a quiet, cold-blooded survivor. Shelled, slow, and eternal."

In the twilight zone of a mega-glacier spanning half the globe, a new kind of spider has evolved, thriving in sub-ice volcanic caves where warmth and minerals bleed upward.Cryarachne spirafons is a distant descendant of trapdoor spiders. It&#039;s now 1.2 meters across, adapted to live inside silica-walled lava tubes beneath the ice. The exoskeleton is ultra-dense, infused with volcanic glass proteins and reflective scale-patches for radiation shielding.It doesn’t spin silk - instead, it builds crystalline spiral lures, grown from dissolved minerals in geothermal runoff. These spirals pulse with thermal gradients that attract chemo-sensitive prey. The spider hides behind them in fissures, striking through with needle-like forelimbs lined with barbs that inject neurogel.Cryarachne’s brain is heavily lobed for spatial and thermal mapping. Its eight eyes are reduced to bio-photonic nodes tuned to infrared and pressure gradients. It doesn’t “see” in light - it perceives heat, airflow, and seismic hum. Mating is rare and highly ritualized: pairs construct counter-spirals and sync pulse patterns before merging burrows.Its prey includes geothermal crustaceans, fungal crawlers, and planktonic glow-worms that drift in subglacial currents. Its only predator is a blind, serpentine pseudoscorpion with snapping heat-sense claws.Cryarachne spirafons is not venomous in the traditional sense - its neurogel rewires prey nervous systems in seconds, causing paralysis, shutdown, or disorientation. It feeds for days on a single organism.It is not sentient. But it is methodical. Cold. Patient. And completely adapted to a world we would no longer recognize."

The sun is brighter, but the atmosphere is thinner, and the magnetic field has weakened - exposing life to extreme radiation and ion storms. True birds are mostly extinct, but a few descendants endure in alien niches. Among them: the dusk penguins.Aerodyptes vespertilio is a flying, cave-dwelling penguin species that re-evolved powered flight in the perpetual twilight of Earth’s shadow hemisphere. Once exclusively aquatic, these penguins adapted to survive in deep atmospheric canyons where heat, shelter, and prey converge.Wings are now leathery and bat-like - derived from fused feather filaments hardened into flexible membranes. Their flight is silent, gliding through sulfurous thermals in bio-luminescent rift valleys. Unlike any modern bird, Aerodyptes echolocates with pulsed trills from its syrinx, navigating pitch-black canopies of fungal towers and gas vents.Their bodies are coated in reflective down to shield against cosmic rays. The beak has evolved into a hooked, infrared-sensitive organ, used to pluck thermal plankton from geothermal bloom clouds. Eyes are reduced, but their lateral line system - once primitive - is now hyper-sensitive to air currents and electromagnetic shifts.They nest upside-down in insulated vaults carved into canyon walls. Eggs are gelatinous, semi-buoyant, and incubated in hanging mucus sacs. Colonies operate like loosely coordinated bat rookeries - vocal, mobile, and territorially aggressive.Aerodyptes is not warm-blooded in the traditional sense. It “ram charges” internal heat through sustained wingbeats, and shuts down nonessential systems during cold cycles - a flying ember in a dying sky."

The climate has cycled through extremes. Forests now grow in dense, biomechanical symbioses with metal-absorbing plants and fungal intelligence networks. In one such biome, an herbivorous colossus roams: the descendant of the panda.Ferrosoma stands nearly 4 meters tall at the shoulder and weighs over 4 tons. It has retained a digitigrade posture and general ursine form but is armored in a flexible lattice of bioaccumulated metallic tissues - iron, manganese, even rare earths absorbed via diet and stored in keratinized skin nodes. This gives the creature a dull, living sheen like oxidized bronze.Its jaws have lost their carnivorous lineage entirely. The skull is wide, flat, with molars evolved into slow-grinding plates used to process silicate-rich mosses and metallic cellulose analogues. A secondary throat chamber filters and excretes biohazardous trace metals.The iconic panda coloration remains, though distorted - swirls of high-reflectivity nanocrystals embedded in the skin confuse heat-sensitive predators and airborne parasites.Ferrosoma doesn’t use vision much. It relies on magnetosensory mapping and low-frequency vibrations. It communicates in rhythmic thumps and deep growls that pulse through the fungal-rooted earth.Behaviorally, it&#039;s solitary, contemplative, slow. Each individual maps and cultivates its territory, tending to certain plant species in an ancient, co-evolved exchange of nutrients and protection.In a world of synthetic predators, hyperfungi, and rogue gene clouds, this panda-descendant survives not by speed or intelligence, but by becoming part of the landscape itself - a walking piece of living geology."

Aelonautilus is no longer a vertebrate in any meaningful sense - bones are gone, replaced by hydrocarbon microfoam structures. Feathers are long abandoned; its outer surface is a taut, semi-transparent dermis filled with lift-gas symbionts and myco-luminescent lichen.It drifts in the aeropelagic layer, 30–50 km above sea level, suspended like a jellyfish in oceanic sky currents. No eyes. No wings. Aelonautilus &quot;swims&quot; using undulating radial lobes that contract in slow pulses to steer through thermals. Once a penguin; now a heliotropic blimp-organism, 12 meters long.Feeding structures dangle downward - kilometer-long cilia trails that sift microplankton and photosynthetic spore-clouds rising from equatorial jungles. It doesn&#039;t hunt. It doesn&#039;t land. It harvests sky-nutrients.Reproduction is asexual and slow: one individual grows an internal clone over decades, which buds off during solar flux events and drifts away. Colonies may span the whole sky above continents, but no two ever meet intentionally.Behavior is distributed across neural ganglia suspended in magnetic fluid chambers. It senses ultraviolet gradients, magnetic fields, and atmospheric vibration. There&#039;s no sociality, no memory, no panic. It simply floats.Aelonautilus is not the penguin&#039;s future - it is its echo, inflated and rewritten by time, unrecognizable but still, somehow, born from wings that once forgot how to fly."

From those remnants emerged Cryosutura fractalith, a quasi-living, self-replicating structure that mimics organismal behavior but is no longer an &quot;animal&quot; in any traditional sense.Cryosutura is a modular crystal-colony, composed of silicon-lattice chitin nodes arranged in branching, recursive geometry. Each “limb” is a repeating chain of subunits that grow, detach, and recombine depending on local chemical gradients. It doesn’t walk.

Energy is stored in ferroelectric folds that open and snap shut like clockwork petals.There is no mouth. No eyes. No web.

Cryosutura senses fluctuations in gravity, electric fields, and magnetic shear, reacting by shifting its shape like a kaleidoscope under stress.It is not conscious. But across its miles-long scaffolds, patterns emerge - pulse rhythms, information blooms, recursive logic knots. Communication may be occurring... through form, not sound.Predators? None. Parasites?

The surface is sterile - bombarded by UV, stripped of nutrients, and scorched by a sun 10% brighter than today. Deep within geothermal tunnel networks, a strange entity exists: Fluvimorphus lacrimosus, or “the weeping river-form.” It’s not an animal in any modern sense. Possibly descended from cnidarians, synthetic life, or even fungi, it exists as a self-replicating liquid colony - a glowing, viscous “river” that winds through rock in search of chemical gradients. Its body is made of ion-conductive gel filled with modular microbeads that act like organs, nerves, and sensors all at once. There is no head, no limbs, no brain - just waves of synchronized pulses and phosphorescent ripples across kilometers of soft-flowing matter. It feeds on sulfur, mineral ions, and fungal detritus, sometimes engulfing and digesting other lifeforms at the molecular level. It doesn’t reproduce traditionally; segments shear off and form new colonies over millennia, slowly mutating into separate identities. Sometimes, two colonies merge and exchange complex bioelectrical patterns in a kind of silent “conversation.” The creature appears to “weep” constantly - droplets condensing along its body, dripping into the stone. These may serve a metabolic purpose or be remnants of a behavior loop long lost to memory. It is not intelligent in the human sense, but its body reacts with precision and adaptability, adjusting tunnel flow, cultivating microbial gardens, and regulating heat. Entire ecosystems depend on it - parasitic scavengers, symbiotic worms, and dust-borne fungi live in its wake. Seen in the dark, it resembles a slow-moving river of cold blue light, humming with unseen charge. Fluvimorphus is not a creature - it&#039;s a process, a behavior, a rhythm etched into the rock, still flowing long after animals have vanished."

Temperature remains stable at 21°c on the cool UV end of the tank with a dryier peak of 28°c on the other end (although 25-26°c is the average). The only denizen in the tank is a juvenile african bullfrog who is getting on comfortably for the most part. With these conditions could I support porcellionides pruinosus along with springtails if I include daily food and occasional calcium and if so could leaving fruit/veg pose a risk to my bullfrog? Can I just sprinkle calcium powder onto the fruit/veg instead of leaving cuttle bone? I had the option early on to go with a bioactive substrate but chose not to as I thought I wouldn&#039;t need vegetation or CuCs, but the idea of having grubs that could eat droppings, loose hopper legs or keep mold down is sounding more appealing to me (and some of these isopods look really neat)."

At the moment though I am just building up my culture so there will be enough when I come round to the project, but I have found out that temps seem to make a difference with the springtail culture I currently have. I have had them for about a month and they are starting to fully eat the nutrional yeast I chuck in there, but they have done so in high temps due to the past week having a heat wave. Before then they were slower and I had to keep removing mold that developed overnight from the yeast. This has started to make me think about whether I should start temp regulating them around their native range of just below 27°C. I have a lab temp controlled imcubator which I used to use for mycology that I am thinking of using by putting the culture inside it to temp regulate. Is this a good idea as long as I on a daily basis remove the culture and open the lid to replenish oxygen levels?"

Just tiny snails that came in on one of the plants. Recently I set up a second filter with lucky bamboo and a week after that I bought two oranda goldfish. One of them is thriving but the other one spends most of his time hiding/resting near the bottom just facing the wall. He comes up to eat but doesn&#039;t do much else. I noticed his scales are flaring off his body. Water tested ammonia at 0.25-0.5ppm and nitrate at 5-10 ppm. When I google it I only get results for dropsy. I think he&#039;s stable since he&#039;s eating but he&#039;s been like this for over a week now. There are no fish vets in my area. I&#039;m considering giving him a salt bath or adding it to the tank. I&#039;ve heard some people say salt baths can be beneficial for goldfish but I don&#039;t want to stress him unnecessarily.

If I have lots of shrimplets I sometimes crush the wafer into powder and spread around tank so it&#039;s easier for them to get some food.5-7 days without food seems to me like survival mode not thriving.&gt;&gt;5010786Real.

My shrimps never freak out like that over food, they are calmly picking at pellets or veggies and swimming around not trying to swarm it in a deathmatch manner. All your shrimps have is biofilm and algae and maybe a rotting plant sometimes, barely any protein. Lots of berried shrimp is also an indicator of good conditions. My shrimps barely released first batch of eggs and now they are berried again like it&#039;s some factory. I&#039;m not very experienced so it&#039;s just my observations and whatever info I&#039;ve gathered doing this hobby."

Well.. the Pogostemon stellatus https://tropica.com/en/plants/plantdetails/4498/4498 keeps disintegrating for some reason.. They grow up to the surface, then from the ground up they starts falling apart, leaving only tiny strands of fiber. I then cut the tops off, replant em, repeat.

I haven&#039;t filled the water on it and its evaporated down to about half capacity.I&#039;m thinking about taking a break from it all to be honest. I was never as consistent with doing water changes and maintenance as I should have been, and I rarely actually watched the fish for a good while now. It felt like a never ending chore that I was just doing the bare minimum upkeep on, and I&#039;d have lots of algae growth on the glass that I&#039;d take a long time to clean off. My tank rarely looked good to just look at for a while now. At the same time I feel bad about totally shutting it down. I&#039;ve had at least one tank running since 8th grade.Part of it is it&#039;s location. I got used to them over time, but the pump sounds would slowly drive me crazy at least a little bit with them being in my room. Plus I dont spent a lot of time there anyway. And it&#039;s also taking up desk space. (I have a stand but it&#039;s not in use right now)What do I do?

They do all sorts of things when on holiday that leads to serious injury or death, moreso that any other group, just to capture it on video.

For example in an arthropod, a segment below their head could elongate just because a gene switching off growth hormone sensitivity no longer worked.

H. Christy to theorize that this is a method of coaxing invertebrates such as earthworms closer to the surface.[22] The foraging theory is the most common explanation of the behavior, and it is often cited in field guides.[23] This theory is complicated by observations of rocking while slowly walking across ground that cannot be foraged, such as hard roads or deep snow.[24]&gt;An alternative theory for the rocking behavior has been proposed by some biologists, such as Bernd Heinrich. It is thought that this behavior is a display to indicate to potential predators that the bird is aware of them.[25] Heinrich notes that some field observations have shown that woodcocks will occasionally flash their tail feathers while rocking, drawing attention to themselves. This theory is supported by research done by John Alcock who believes this is a type of aposematism.[26]I suppose the latter theory could be tested based on whether they still do it if only observed by a remote camera."
