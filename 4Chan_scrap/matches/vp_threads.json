She is a very powerful Pokémon, but to balance it out, her power is sealed. Quartez wanted all of her power, so he had the symbol, an X (From the Roman alphabet, Chi), placed on his eye. I&#039;d say that&#039;s quite the development. Quartz started his journey as a bit of a doormat, but now he&#039;ll sass you back and has way more of a backbone."

I&#039;ve got a few chapters of his story done, but want to get more finished before I really start posting it.&gt;&gt;57993039Potentially entertaining, but I prefer elder/younger sibling dynamics.

Beefcake Ivy was funny but I think the way that you softened her figure, it makes her design work better. I like both the old and new shirts and I think Ivy might change between them occasionally. It seems like you&#039;re going for a cross of &quot;streetwear&quot;, nurse, and &quot;formal-ish&quot; attire. Now I&#039;m going to review her shopping list.&gt;New shortsI like the reference to the BW fem-protag with the coloration. The color also just feels more natural.&gt;New beltAwesome. Definitely an upgrade.&gt;Frilly fist guardsI welcome the frills, but I&#039;d make the red pink, personally.&gt;Frilly thigh highsThey&#039;re certainly more feminine, but I feel like the old socks were more... athletic?&gt;New HatI like the idea of that star being Ivy&#039;s sort of &quot;personal&quot; logo, but I&#039;m not sure if the red clashes with the rest of her outfit.&gt;New topI like this one because it looks just a little bit more formal to contrast with her old outfit. She could maybe wear this to stuff like gym battles while her shirt with the pocket could be more &quot;formal&quot;&gt;PumpsI&#039;d make them pink, personally.&gt;Heal BallsIt makes sense for her occupation. However, I&#039;m not sure if the color scheme matches up exactly with the rest of her outfit. She may want to paint a custom color combination with the same pattern. It could be a way of showing how she makes stuff for her Pokemon.&gt;Thong...I don&#039;t know how I feel about it. &gt;///&lt;Bibi-moding again?I like that you didn&#039;t shoehorn asymmetry, but I&#039;m just a bit iffy on the inclusion of such a vibrant red because imo it kind of conflicts with the more pastel-ish shirt and pants. If you want to lean more into the “mature and feminine” aspects you could give her some jewelry maybe some cute bracelets, necklace, or a navel piercing (yes I am biased but I do think she’d look good with one and it would help bring out the more feminine figure of her redesign)"

        "text": "&gt;&gt;57994876&gt;&gt;57995088Now to answer your questions.Wol starts the story with only a Blastoise, but so far he&#039;s gotten a Hitmonchan, Chansey, and Vileplume on his team. Pretty much, since there are six classes in FF1 he is going to have a pokemon for each of them. Blastoise as the Warrior/Knight, Hitmonchan as the Monk, Chansey as the White Mage/Cleric, and Vileplume as the Black Mage/Wizard. I&#039;ve got two more mons planned for his final team, but that would be spoilers.Tobio only has his Poochyena as the detective is not a battler. The dark type is the friendliest puppy in the world and will happily burn or electrify its tongue to give a friendly lick to anybody. And while more of a lover than a fighter it will firmly stand its ground against the non-pokemon ghouls and specters that the agency has to deal with. Despite its antics, its a surprisingly polite puppy. It makes sure that its goofy shenanigans only ever inconvenience Tobio and never the clients.As for why he stopped being a conman... Its fairly simple. The detective agency gave him a chance to use his skills of charismatic manipulation and quick thinking to leave a life of crime behind. He can&#039;t remember how it happened, but he feels a debt of gratitude that could only be for the detective that was erased. So the only thing to do is find them regardless of the dangers. He ain&#039;t gonna lose to some memory loss."

        "text": "&gt;&gt;57959892So I worked out the kinks of my OC&#039;s backstory, but then opened up a whole other can of worms with how the overall story of the region plays out. The Player (Protagonist) is sent 10 years into the future by a Pokémon with dominion over Time (Arceus/Dialga/Celebi) and has to continue their journey as if nothing happened, but they learn gradually about their predicament. The Rival (my OC) suffered a number of crushing defeats against the Player &amp; in fact lost one of their Pokémon during their &quot;final&quot; battle against each other (likely either their Morpeko or Weavile- which causes serious, gutting trauma) leading them to changing their entire Type Specialty from Dark to Poison to mitigate all of Dark&#039;s weaknesses, becoming the 8th &amp; final Gym Leader of the Region (possibly Unova?) after Roxie leaves the Gym to pursue her career as a Rock Star- but returns after the Rival- whom I&#039;ll call Magenta for simplicity&#039;s sake, requests their return (or maybe Klara? Idk) in order to challenge the Pokémon League to become the Champion and final challenge in their shared journey. The Rival&#039;s Starter will depend on the Type chosen by the Player as usual- but those wouldn&#039;t be the official starters of the region obviously."

And no, the trauma from losing their Sneasel (decided to un-evolve the Weavile making it to where they never got to use the Razor Claw on it, and ended up finding a Hisuian Sneasel to use it on instead) is what spurs them on to change their type specialty and get stronger, but then the Player goes missing because of the 10 year time travel, and without the losses to the player constantly holding them back- they&#039;re able to excel and achieve their status as Gym Leader- but upon hearing that they&#039;ve &quot;returned&quot;, that prompts them to relinquish their Gym to their Disciple &amp; become the Champion before the Player has a chance to.And yes, time changes a lot of things-"

        "text": "&gt;&gt;57996035For Wol, well is relative. His story is going to hit every story beat of the original, but the details of why events play out the way they do are fleshed out to suit a story about Pokemon. So if you read like a wiki summary of the story you will know stuff like &#039;They defeat the pirates and gain a ship, meet a blind witch, meet the dwarves, discover the cursed elf prince, head to the marsh caves to find a crown...&#039; but the actual specifics will be played around with.For example, the blind witch Matoya in the original games? Matoya is a hex maniac black mage living with the white mage Joy of Pravoka in a pokemon TM (Type Magic) shop they own together. She tends yo an exotic garden behind the shop with her Paras which they use as ingredients for the TMs they sell. But she insists that she is not a witch. That would be her cranky mother, who lives in cave to the north. And her mother is in fact an wise, powerful, and sassy blind Vileplume who has been attacked, cursed, and robbed by an unknown dark elf. Refusing to sit around and rot away while Wol attempts to find a way to save her she joins him as one of the prophesied Pokemon of Light. But as for well, Wol is suffering from grief of the events of the chaos temple as best as he can. He is also doing his best to protect Princess Sarah&#039;s younger sister, Jane Corneria the Second and her pikachu, who immediately ran away from home to follow him on an adventure. She is dealing with her own grief, and despite being an energetic brat the two end up supporting each other as an older brother younger sister sort of relationship. Especially because Jane already assumes the clueless Wol is going to marry her sister Sarah."

I&#039;m a big fan of the series as a whole and decided that FF1 would be a good place to start when it comes to writing a pokemon fanfic for it. Its so barebones that you get a lot of freedom in interpreting it, which is apparent for the different interpretations the first game has gotten in different remakes and spinoffs. Wol is actually named after the protagonist Wol from FF Mobius, a phone game that got discontinued that does an alternate tale involving Garland and Sarah and all that. Pretty much the world is prophesized to be saved by a man name Wol, so there is just a constant wave of guys named Wol being isekai&#039;d to the setting in masse. So the majority of NPCs you meet in the game are actually other guys named Wol."

He deserves a spotlight for his hard work &lt;3 Also great job on the updated archives, I can tell a lot of time and effort went into sorting everything.&gt;Thread question: What kind of books does your OC like to read?Despite her appearances, Ivy is quite studious and often reads text books about medicine or other pokemon aid related topics. She&#039;s not the naturally intelligent type, so she works hard to keep up when it comes to book smarts in her field and loves keep tabs on Pokemon with healing capabilities in her notebook.

She loves a good macho publication.&gt;Drawing Task: Draw your OC as if they are from another IP, could be Digimon, could be monster hunter, etc.In honor of the new Panty and Stocking season coming out, enjoy Ivy in that style&gt;&gt;57990455&gt;Is she tough enough to spar with Pokémon?Sure is. I like to imagine the black belt trainers regularly train and spar with their pokemon and Ivy&#039;s no exception. Hitmonchan is her main sparring partner, but she often likes to compete with her other Pokemon in other ways too, like racing or other physical feats. In her epilogue Alola arc, she also manages to subdue a Buzzwole in combat and catch it, adding another sparring partner to her roster.&gt;&gt;57995384Wow Magenta really went full send after losing one of her mons, she&#039;s barely recognizable after the fact. Really cool backstory though. I&#039;m a huge sucker for different variants of a team based on starter choice too.

I&#039;ll explain my thought process behind some of the design choices&gt;Frilly thigh highsI thought it was an easy way to soften her up overall and make her a bit more girly. Fun fact, I added the frills on the fist guards to match the ones I put on the socks. So in a chicken and egg situation, thigh highs came first.&gt;Star logoI&#039;m not entirely sold on the star logo desu, especially cuz Miko has a heavier star motif. I meant for it to be a kind of an alternate take on a red cross (four points), just felt appropriate to give her some sort of emblem. I considered making it a half pokeball design to ground her in the Pokemon world more, but truthfully just got lazy and didn&#039;t want to go back and change it.&gt;New TopChanging out her outfit/mixing and matching is a good idea, especially for a girl who&#039;s interested in fashion&gt;Red pumpsI originally had her wearing some form of pink boots/footwear, and it just felt off to me. I think the red on her feet and fists in contrast to her overall pink appearance is a good signifier that those are her &quot;weapons&quot; so to speak. The accents on her top and headgear are there to tie it all together. And it&#039;s not like red wasn&#039;t a part of her color palate prior. Red and pink go together imo, very valentine-y &gt;ThongJust some classic fighting game character spice of adding unnecessary sex appeal :P&gt;Heal BallsPainting a custom pokeball isn&#039;t really her style. When it comes to superficial things, she&#039;s not really a crafty type of person. She much prefers to buy things already made and wouldn&#039;t spend the time it takes to DIY, she&#039;s much to impatient for that. That&#039;s not to say she won&#039;t mix up her own medicines or make a protein shake for her mons, she always has time for fixing up others or getting stronger. Besides, they&#039;re too practical and cheap for her not to love them."

And I think getting defeated as the champion for the same reason will be very humbling for her character.&gt;&gt;57999754&gt;&gt;57999788The timid, shy version comes first- there is a 10 year time gap between the two versions, and there was a 3 year period during which they couldn&#039;t get over what&#039;d happened- but it was also around that time when they encountered their Hisuian Sneasel and it made an impact on her life to help in her character development.It was during that time that they became a disciple of the region&#039;s Poison-Type Gym which was eventually handed over to her."

Haven&#039;t decided between these two scenarios yet- but it turns out that she&#039;s responsible for the Player being sent 10 years into the future. (I know this isn&#039;t how it works in-game but-) Space Time Distortions pop up occasionally (haven&#039;t decided why yet) and similarly to how Pokémon that appear in them vanish along with the Distortions, the Player is either:Shoved into the Distortion just as it&#039;s closing by a shadowy figure (the Rival), or-The Player &amp; Rival are exploring/investigation a Distortion when it begins to close, and either trips or abandons the Player inside the Distortion after they&#039;re able to get out safely. The guilt causes some major changes to their character both good &amp; bad. With their Rival &amp; their greatest obstacle out of the way, they&#039;re able to excel and achieve things they weren&#039;t previously able to due to discouragement, coming into their own as a successful and well know Gym Leader &amp; member of the Pokémon League. It&#039;s only after the Player reappears 10 years later does the trauma kick back in and she has the sudden desire to fight her way to the top again tooth &amp; nail in order to stay ahead of her Rival. She requests the return of the original Gym Leader and leaves the Gym in their hands."
