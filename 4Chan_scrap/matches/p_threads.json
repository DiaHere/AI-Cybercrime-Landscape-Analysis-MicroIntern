If not then you don&#039;t need MF. Do you need quick and reliable AF? If yes then stay away from spending money on MF.MF is specific in what it does good that if you need to ask if MF is better or FF from upgrading from your APS-C system then you don&#039;t need MF. Just stick with FF, for the majority of everyday photography (including pro and art photography) you can do with FF or even with APS-C system.If you really do want to move away from your Fuji APS-C system then look around the market, look for photos you like and with what system it was made with and rent it out for a week or two, then rent something else. Then decide on what to buy. Just forget about MF.Ps.: modern digital MF is not much bigger than FF. Film 645 has considerably larger frames than digital 645. Digital 645 is basically FF with higher pixel density, the emphasis is on the lenses."

        "text": "&gt;&gt;4445915&gt;Color calibration is tonalityLmao no, tonality is basically color depth/bit depth plus resolution.medium format shoots 16 bit raws and can actually fill those 16 bits with accurate info, and the resolution is a major factor here. 100mp bayer is about 80mp non-bayer, or the peak resolution of scanned 6x7 slide film, which gives it the same ability to record gradients and surface textures as 6x7 slide film if you simply resize your files to a saner size. digital accuracy IS tonality. film had practically infinite &quot;bits&quot; and covered deep, saturated colors most digitals still cant record. LF film is even better than a 150mp MFDB, and is still produced because basically no one needs that resolution every day and shooting film is actually more cost effective than shooting digital there.100mp dx medium format is the point where photos start approximating life better. the camera does less reduction, and things that would be messy and harsh on a lesser camera start to look more structured because all the fine shading and color differences were preserved and give things more shape and separation. if you&#039;re a skin tone autist or shoot landscapes in a place with actual woods medium format is it, either go 100mp or buy a 6x9 camera.even when you reduce your files to a shit ass 4chan jpeg to show them to some loser furfag weeaboo that doesn&#039;t matter, a lot of the color/shading/texture is still going to be there and lesser sensors will look more contrasty and plasticky in the same scenarios."

Very big deal.- Tends to provide better optical quality with less loss of detail (IBIS isn&#039;t perfect) (not big enough of a difference for me to care).Cons of Lens IS:- Needs to have it on the lens, so not all your lenses benefit.- Increases the cost of every lens it&#039;s on.- Doesn&#039;t have as high of max capability.- Only corrects for two axis.Honestly, lack of IBIS isn&#039;t going to keep me from buying the R8, as Canon lenses tend to have IS where it matters. If my camera ever pays for itself, THEN it justifies spending even more for a better system. Lens IS works well enough for casual stuff."

Kept missing eye focus even though the eye track was spot on. It would instead focus on eyebrow or eye lashes leaving the eye soft. Had some weird focus issue in general as well. Happy I upgraded to Sony. The R8&#039;s 40 shot burst was cool though. but having 7+ stops of IBUIS is game changing for low light / slow shutter shooting."

If you want 45 megapickles get a refurbished z7ii from Nikon. The z7ii has good enough IBIS for me to shoot at 1/15th using a 35mm in low light easily. The af isn&#039;t quite as snappy as the zf/z5ii but it&#039;s honestly good enough for me since the main difference is the lack of subject detection outside of people and animals. If you want to spend 3k get a refurbished z8 and you can have the best of both worlds. It is larger and heavier though."

Does AF really improve that much compared to the older 23/35 f/2s or f/1.4s? • Do these lenses put Fuji closer to FF-tier IQ (realistically), or is it still a dead end vs jumping to A7R III/IV or Zf? • Worth trying these lenses first, or just commit to FF now?Trying to make the smartest leap - or not leap at all.Someone also pointed that the XF 23mm f1.4 R LM WR is a better lens than the 33mm. Have a look at the resolution charts from lenstip, comparing 18, 23 and 33:https://www.lenstip.com/611.4-Lens_review-Fujifilm_Fujinon_XF_18_mm_f_1.4_R_LM_WR_Image_resolution.htmlhttps://www.lenstip.com/628.4-Lens_review-Fujifilm_Fujinon_XF_23_mm_f_1.4_R_LM_WR_Image_resolution.htmlhttps://www.lenstip.com/622.4-Lens_review-Fujifilm_Fujinon_XF_33_mm_f_1.4_R_LM_WR_Image_resolution.html"

        "text": "&gt;&gt;4449987&gt;&gt;4449988A lens can be one or the other or both. A macro lens is one that allows you to focus closely, resulting in your subject taking up more of the frame and being more magnified. A telephoto is one with a long focal length, or a higher number before the mm (which if you didn&#039;t know stands for millimetres). At what point a lens becomes telephoto (ignoring the technical definition) can vary slightly from person to person, and also changes based on the sensor size of your camera. Generally speaking it&#039;s anything longer than around the diagonal dimension of the sensor, so longer than about 50mm for full frame, longer than 35mm for APS-C, longer than 25mm for a four thirds camera, etc.Combining these two, a longer more telephoto lens that is also a macro lens will allow you to get high magnification on your subject while also being further away from it, because it will be more &quot;zoomed in&quot;. For simplicity&#039;s sake that&#039;s what the focal length means, a longer focal length gives you a tighter field of view that is more zoomed in. Double the focal length and you&#039;re basically cropping a quarter off each side of the image, or you can double your distance from your subject and get essentially the same photo (not exactly, but again we&#039;re simplifying things)."

The majority of lenses nikon makes for this thing are slow as balls. The viewfinder mode autofocus is slower than my old canon rebel. Live view is much worse than my old canon rebel. Not to mention a modern camera. And it&#039;s not a good sensor like everyone says, it&#039;s noticeably noisy. Nikon d750 ISO 3200 looks like sony a7c ISO 6400, and pushed shadows turn mushy and purple. the AA sensor is so strong 24mp actually resolves 20mp. I&#039;ve already returned it and will be keeping my a7c. /p/ was wrong about everything, nikon fanboys are just insane and delusional. these old pieces of shit do not offer image quality that competes with modern mirrorless. i would rather use a fuji x-t30ii than a nikon d750. it would still be a huge step up in almpst everything."

The Classic encourages you to use a more SOOC workflow (if any) as it sacrifices detail, even in RAW for more contrasty &quot;ready-to-use&quot; tonality. While the colours remain almost identical between the two models, the higher dynamic range of the mark II and the RAW files it produces are definitely much flatter, reserving better detail in the shadows and MUCH better detail in the highlights than its predecessor. For me, I would never get rid of either camera, I love them both and still use a mark II for my paid work today, but it&#039;s obvious why the classic has such a cult following. While it&#039;s results never looked particularly filmic to me, the shooting experience of having a full frame camera with manual controls and great lenses while not necessarily having to edit your photos at all to achieve good results is definitely reminiscent of using something like an EOS 1n or Elan."

Cheap, plentiful, easy to find. The peak of film camera design. Huge lens ecosystem, most compatible with modern lenses.All the modern auto-focus and conveniences if you want it, or drop it into manual mode for full control.Everyone should be starting off on some $50 Rebel EOS or Maxxum or something.

        "text": "&gt;&gt;4443454Yes. Give up trying to optimize your photography with your camera, get something that actually has soul™, git gud, and learn to actually enjoy photography. The KP&#039;s image quality is only a little behind the Sony unless you&#039;re trying to get your camera to see in the dark and slow shutter speeds aren&#039;t an option. That&#039;s the main thing that matters.You&#039;ll never enjoy photography using a Sony. The enjoyment of Sony comes not from photography, but from wearing beanies and hiring hot models so you can show off on instagram and tiktok.Notice very few people run Youtube channels about Pentax except Snappiness, despite it being an uncontested niche. That&#039;s because once people buy Pentax, they actually start taking pictures.&gt;&gt;4443464Just get a Pentax K3iii with DA Limited&#039;s. 15mm for your wide-ish, 40mm or 70mm depending on what you consider a short telephoto, 35mm for your macro. For your super telephoto you can pick up the 300mm.&gt;&gt;4443465Google &quot;Pentax Limited Lens Special Site&quot;. Start collecting.&gt;&gt;4443479Once you start printing large 24mp because inadequate. 40MP sounds like what I&#039;d like to shoot for, but 30s are more realistic. Once you git gud someone always has some rich aunt that insists on buying large ass prints as a Christmas gift regardless of your genre of photography. 20x30 prints are not uncommon.&gt;&gt;4443460Are you printing large? No? Doesn&#039;t matter.Are you enjoying photography? Yes? Does matter.Gigapixel AI works in a pinch if large prints do matter (although it&#039;s nice being able to say your art is untouched by AI, AI denoise and upscaling seems to be legit areas to use AI -- basically use it to make up for technological shortcomings, not artistic vision shortcomings)."

I&#039;m a Pentax fanboy and 80% of my posts on this board are trying to convince people to buy Pentax.This makes the Sony fanboy seethe, because they hate knowing people are taking better pictures on gear they deem inferior, and what&#039;s worse from their perspective, is people shooting Pentax actually enjoy doing photography.&gt;&gt;4443559Just buy something cheap. Like a Pentax K-70 or KF. But seriously, you don&#039;t need to spend $1500 to take pictures of fucking butterflies. If you don&#039;t like my Pentax recommendation then I recommend the Canon R50, seriously. You won&#039;t have to learn much photography and can rely on auto modes like your phone camera, but end up with much better pictures. The 55-210mm lens will be good for butterflies because it&#039;s actually pretty decent at &quot;close up&quot; photography and will let you keep your distance without spooking them, and Canon&#039;s autofocus is very good making taking those pictures super easy."

Only exception is if autofocus performance is important to you, where the K3iii is a little behind Nikon D500 performance and ahead of the K1ii and KP. But the K1ii is probably better than the KP for autofocus.KP is Pentax&#039;s &quot;I just want to enjoy photography&quot; camera. By all accounts, it lives up to that standard.My plan is to get a KP to take over as an EDC camera from my KF, and the KF will be used for social outings (because of the flippy screen) and for making videos for social media.The latest rumor is that a refreshed K3iii is coming out somewhat soon (which in Pentax time means it could be 3 months or 3 years) to replace the K3iii as parts became unavailable during COVID, so I&#039;m personally holding off on a K3iii for now. I&#039;ll pick that up once it comes out.(A cool thing about buying a mature system, is eventually you actually have everything from the brand that you care about, and it becomes super affordable (relative to the camera market overall) to keep up)."

I started from scratch, so I was able to buy with intention to use lenses on both FF and APSC. The FA 21, 31, 43, 77 work great on both systems, and then I have the 15, 2.8 f/2.8, and 18-135 for APS-C itself, and 28-105 for FF itself. A lot of overlap so it&#039;s comfy to have both systems.Thinking of getting the 300mm to use on both systems, too.Sometimes I use the 18-135mm on my K1ii, as it&#039;s nice having that extra few MM&#039;s to hit 200mm equivalent. It&#039;s a better experience than I thought it&#039;d be.&gt;&gt;4443701It&#039;s about the same size as a Lumix G9 m43 lol.I think they really nail ergonomics and &quot;user experience&quot;. I turn the screen off and just start shooting, only looking at the screen to review at the end of every &quot;sprint&quot;. I prefer the OVF experience and Pentax is the only brand still saying they&#039;re invested in DSLRs (whether Pentax will discontinue it is yet to be seen and up in the air -- no one except the people at Ricoh knows, but they&#039;re still releasing firmware and &quot;premium features&quot; so it&#039;s a good sign). Using Pentax cameras, more than any other brand, I find I can focus more on photography instead of the camera."

        "text": "&gt;&gt;4443701&gt;&gt;4443706Just wanted to elaborate on OVFs.I have a theory about OVF&#039;s.So, human sensory experience -- our vision is very, very strong. We are vision-centric animals. It overrides all of our senses *and even our imagination*. Do an experiment for yourself: close your eyes, imagine your phone. Imagine it with a background wallpaper that&#039;s green instead of whatever color it is (if it&#039;s green, then imagine it&#039;s like red or something). You can probably imagine it pretty vividly.*Now look at your phone* and try to imagine it again. You&#039;ll notice it&#039;s much less vivid, if you can imagine it at all. You can probably notice your imagination competing with what you actually see, with your focus veering back and forth.*This leads us to the advantage of OVF*. EVFs are WYSIWYG -- generally, what you&#039;re actually seeing in the EVF is the actual picture you&#039;re going to end up with. It&#039;s the exposure you&#039;ll get, it&#039;s the color you&#039;ll get, everything. Seeing what you&#039;re going to get overrides your imagination for envisioning the photograph you want to get.An OVF, however, requires you to use your imagination more, to think about how what you&#039;re seeing will transform into a photograph you&#039;ll eventually get. You stop relying on the EVF to get the result, and you become a more imaginative photographer for it. How will your framing and composition work with the contrast and colors present? How will your exposure lend to developing contrast in the final image? I find I&#039;m thinking about all of this stuff far more with an OVF. Not having the WYSIWYG image helps this process come far more naturally.This is reason #1.Reason #2:There&#039;s also something intangible -- you look into an OVF, and you&#039;re seeing the real world. It enhances your interaction with it. It&#039;s a human touch, that EVF just doesn&#039;t come close. Would you rather watch a sexy woman undress with your own eyes in the same room, or just watch a live video of it behind a partition?"

At least the Minolta stuff I can throw it on a new Snoy mirrorless and have vintage glass when I want while still keeping the benefits of new tech (best in class AF, low light performance/DR). Minolta glass is nearly worthless too. Its not like the professional Nikon/Canons are bad cameras either. Most of the Disney photographers at the parks use D750s/D810s. Canon 5Ds were used by most of Hollywood/Media for a good 10 years (and stuff like the 5D Classic/Mk2 + Nikon D200s became cult classics for their SOOC photos). Canon EF and Nikkor glass is some of the best in the industry too (Canon 24-105 f4 USM for example).Its just that Pentax stopped being competitive in 2018 and as everyone swapped to mirrorless it meant the old legacy DSLRs depreciated hardcore to the point that they&#039;re often 50% the Pentax equivalent (when brand new they cost the same). You can buy a D810 or a 5D Mk3 on Craigslist/Facebook locally, there&#039;s maybe 10 K1s for sale in the United States at any given time and they&#039;re almost always 2x the price.I only bought my KF cuz of the ergos, but I kinda feel like I would&#039;ve gotten a better camera if I tried a D500 or a 7D MK2 instead. I will say Pentax does do magic with their sensors imo, they do awesome at higher ISOs. It might be due to the lack of AA filter + thin glass over the sensor. Pic rel is with a 70-200mm Pentax-F I paid $20 for (there&#039;s a Takumar-F 70-210mm on eBay if you wanna try)"

Dog people aren&#039;t capable of art. They can only analyze specs and participate in pseudo-social brand wars. Cat people are the only real artists.https://leica-camera.blog/2020/09/28/nikita-teryoshin-backyard-diaries/Cat people are more creative and artistically daring. Dog people can make good particle physicists and engineers. Look up famous cat people, all artists. Look up famous dog people, all politicians and scientists. Ever seen cat person art? Its amazing. Dog person art? Its accurate, well done, and boring. Dog people have hitlers artistic sense, cat people have that black jazz and jewish funk. If you’re a dog person you probably shouldnt be wasting your time with photography as an art because jazz and funk is all that stands out. Anyone can be accurate and realistic if they buy a nice camera.Its ok if you arent and cant be an artist. You are still a person. Most people make fun of artists for our mental illnesses and trouble paying bills anyways lol you’re not missing out on much."

        "text": "&gt;&gt;4443820&gt;i posted tons of photos then i quit from gearfaggotry overloadThe cure is simpleBuy a canon or a sony. Go against the hipsters. Separate yourself from them permanently. Reject their ideology. Reject their priorities. Reject their lifestyle. Stop going to hipster hangouts like 4chan and reddit.Stop exposing yourself to hipster subcultures like photography youtube and photography instagram. Your life will improve before your eyes. The longer you go without seeing the word &quot;soul&quot; ascribed to an electronic camera, the more soul your actual photos will accumulate. Your photos can have soul or your camera can have soul. Pick one. Leicas and hasselblads are the only exception because they are the most socially acceptable camera to wear as part of an outfit. Wearing a sony makes people think you’re with a government backed news source. Wearing a leica or hasselblad makes people think you’re a harmless college student taking shitty photos to submit for finals. In this case, using the &quot;wrong&quot; camera beats not using any camera, because wearing anything that looks like asian electronics (even a fujifilm xt5 can be mistaken for a 100mp pro camera) is a great way to be told that staff will hang on to your camera unless you want to leave."

The more you buy and sell, the less time you spend shooting and figuring out your actual needs.You already have a near mint 5D4 at half off the usual price. A 50/1.4 (or 1.8 if you really want to play it safe and skimp - it&#039;s €80) will run you for not much more. I would start with that, then add on a 24-70/4 if you like the experience. It will only get cheaper in the future.Until you have legitimate, strong reasons to sell your gear and buy an A7III (or any other camera), use what you have. None of what you described gives me any indication that you need to run back to the shop. And don&#039;t listen to people that have personal conflicts of interest because they spent way too much money on a gear they don&#039;t need and feel a desire to cope and justify their purchase to themselves by shilling online."

It’s not something you need to get started.Like other anon said, start out with matrix metering (the camera will determine exposure by itself), and learn when and why to usr Aperture priority and Shutter priority modes. Once you understand those, you can use manual mode where you’re using both aperture and shutter together, using either auto ISO and manual ISO.Sometimes matrix metering won’t work very well because your subject is really bright or dark. In these situations you can use center or spot metering, which gives you more control over what the camera will try to optimize exposure for. Learn to use those metering modes when it makes sense.After you understand all of that and get a bit good at it, THEN worry about the zone system and all that. Learn to walk before you run."

They might bite instead of worrying about shipping + eBay or trade in fees. That&#039;s why lately I&#039;ve been shilling the CanoNikon DSLRs, they&#039;re cheap and common enough with everyone switching to mirrorless systems that you can get them relatively cheap. On that note a Canon RP is probably the cheapest FF mirrorless you can buy ATM other than a Sony A7.M43 is hard to justify. But a EM1 is a good camera. It depends on the application. If you&#039;re doing a lot of outdoors distance photography of stuff like wildlife that&#039;s the M43 niche. Olympus in particular has razor sharp glass that I wish you could get on other brands. But the problem is the lack of dynamic range which means that photos that are under or over exposed are harder to recover, and the cameras can struggle in low light moreso than other larger sensor cameras. Just spend 5 minutes here and you&#039;ll get spammed to.death about how it&#039;s good or bad. I disagree with it being &quot;the same as a cell phone&quot; though, a M43 sensor is still bigger than any phone and 1in sensor phones are exclusive to $1500+ Chinese market Androids, plus half the reason to shoot with a camera is because of the glass which you can&#039;t put on a phone."

Panasonic is less than 5%. Olympus went out of business. That is because almost no one bought that garbage.The people shilling micro four thirds are camera nerds. They are pursuing them because they look more like classic film cameras. That&#039;s all there is to it. Then buy these, then buy $1500 f2.8 prime lenses because they say leica on them and have aperture rings like classic film lenses. Micro four thirds is leica faggotry for the working man. the working man that can&#039;t even afford fuji.And you need to believe me about this, because I shoot micro four thirds. I just can&#039;t afford full frame. I&#039;ve rented FFs for gigs before and it&#039;s just a straight upgrade except for a small handful of edge cases."

That&#039;s why studio professionals always shot medium format as a minimum (but ideally large format), with 35mm only for personal works or photojournalism where quickness was more important. You can see the difference very plainly in some collections - for example, Yoshihiko Ueda&#039;s works for Suntory, shot on 8x10 (on-site, posed) and 35mm (b-roll, personal snaps). Pic rel. With digital sensors, the difference is somewhat less pronounced, because the size difference between M43 and FF is a lot smaller than the difference between FF and 8x10 and M43 sensor resolutions have reached full frame (25MP). Now the differences come in rendering style (for M43: flat, worse color gradation, subject separation) and technical quirks like pixel pitch, lower DR. As such the only benefit M43 ever had was compactness, which is now moot when APS-C bodies can be just as tiny."

Most of this is subject, but if the subject/light is good they can then appreciate quality or be disappointed.Most image quality comes from the lens, next the image processing, then the sensor quality.Smartphones fail at the lens but so did old point and shoots, they don&#039;t fail bad enough to complain about unless it&#039;s for portraits or important shit. Snapshots, they&#039;re fine. Biggest issue with this is people DON&#039;T CLEAN THEIR LENSES but clean phone lenses are good enough for most things, including landscapes.Smartphones majorly fail at the image processing. This is what defines &quot;the look&quot; of the image beyond the subject/lighting and is where things go horribly wrong. You can get around this by using 3rd party apps and shooting RAW but most don&#039;t bother, and wind up with the &quot;Samsmug&quot; or &quot;Applel&quot; or &quot;HuaWHY&quot; look on their images and then blame it on the lens, and think a new one will do better, and it doesn&#039;t, it&#039;s just more of the same with different post-process/ai shit and they become repeat customers never understanding why their images look so fake.Smartphone sensors are actually good enough for a lot of things but for single-shot (no bracketing or multi-sampling possible to increase IQ+DR) capture they are a bit too noisy, and this results in copium attempts at de-noising, and this just circles back into shit image processing with fake looking NR artifacts. In a well lit scene within the DR of the sensor (not extreme contrast) and for a subject that doesn&#039;t require cropping/digital zooming, they&#039;re fine.Problem is people want to crop/zoom, not shoot RAW, and shoot under shit lighting, never use a tripod, never clean their lens, and shoot without blocking sources of glare, so it all adds up to BAD. Mostly user error, but a good chunk is the device.Used $100 DSLRs do better in the hands of retards."
