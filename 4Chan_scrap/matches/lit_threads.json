It&#039;s probably best to just churn out different stories. I just don&#039;t see how you can tie it all together. Imagine ASOIAF but the various parts are their own story. W5Ks, story about the Wall and beyond, Dany story, etc. It&#039;d be easier to finish. Plus it&#039;s probably jarring for the story to go from a political intrigue in a medieval setting to one where you&#039;re uncovering a fake alien race. I hated the 100 when it did this. Is there a story where this went well?"

It&#039;s set in the future (obviously) and society has had multiple crises with AI getting out of hand and essentially ruining their civilization, because AI was still not really sapient, it was just developing into more and more advanced LLMs which were limited, and also lacked any sort of consciousness.The solution was that they created &quot;Familiars,&quot; which essentially shares the physical brain of a normal person via an implant in their brain stem. The AI sort of cohabitates with the human, using elements of their brain chemistry to perform functions that can&#039;t be computerized properly. They&#039;re much better at computation, disciplined action and clock speed than humans, but they rely on the human brain to actually experience qualia. Everyone gets one of these from the State at birth, and 80% of the economy is now just people renting these AI Familiars out to corporations or the state. Because of safeguards built into the system, the host is dominant, and even if the Familiar were to somehow become dangerous, it is at least always anchored to the host, so ripping the implant out or killing the host will delete the AI.My question is essentially, would it be a better complication if these Familiars subtly revolted from what amounts to slavery, or if the effect of having a machine using part of your brain to experience quality is indistinguishable from schizophrenia, and people/AIs start going nuts? Has this been done before?"

An alcohol-laced murmur seeped up the dimly lit corridor, a fractured stream of slurred syllables and jagged laughter ricocheting off graffiti scrawled prefabricated walls. Doors, identical in their filth and decay, stood closed, narrowly spaced on either side, a procession of lives reduced to their barest essentials: a bed, a desk, an access point, all neatly contained within eight by eight feet of rented existence.&gt; Through the half-inch crack of the door, Avery peered down the dimly lit filth strewn corridor, spying shadows moving clumsily at its far end. The cool outside air slipped through the gap across Avery&#039;s face, a brief reprieve from the stale, damp air inside, the corridor’s light catching the edge of his profile, carving his features into fleeting relief.&gt; Rough edges of laughter and fragmented shouts echoed closer, two drunks swaying in loose synchronisation, staggered steps echoing off the corridor’s stained walls. One paused, words spilling from him in venomous slurs before the shadow of a fist connected, a wet dull thud, echoing with grim finality as the recipient slumped to the floor. He watched as the silhouette of the victor, breathing hard and off balance, rifled through the slumped man’s pockets, head turning fervently looking around. Avery eased the door shut, the latch catching with a whisper, the cool air abating, returning to the stale air inside he knew well."

I mean, it&#039;s fantasy YA with werewolves, vampires and romance (pls don&#039;t laugh at me) so it&#039;s bound to be somewhat cringe, but for some reason I can&#039;t write past couple of chapters cause I find it really, really cringy with some dumb scene not making sense. :/It&#039;s mostly just for myself and maybe upload it later to Wattpad or Inkitt, but still... I don&#039;t know how to get over the cringe feeling especially since I&#039;m the one writing it."
