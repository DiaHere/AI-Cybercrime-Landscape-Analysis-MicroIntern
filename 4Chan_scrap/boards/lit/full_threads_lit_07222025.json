People talk sometimes of bestial cruelty, but that\u2019s a great injustice and insult to the beasts; a beast can never be so cruel as a man, so artistically cruel. The tiger only tears and gnaws, that\u2019s all he can do. He would never think of nailing people by the ears, even if he were able to do it. These Turks took a pleasure in torturing children, too; cutting the unborn child from the mother\u2019s womb, and tossing babies up in the air and catching them on the points of their bayonets before their mothers\u2019 eyes. Doing it before the mothers\u2019 eyes was what gave zest to the amusement. Here is another scene that I thought very interesting. Imagine a trembling mother with her baby in her arms, a circle of invading Turks around her. They\u2019ve planned a diversion: they pet the baby, laugh to make it laugh. They succeed, the baby laughs. At that moment a Turk points a pistol four inches from the baby\u2019s face. The baby laughs with glee, holds out its little hands to the pistol, and he pulls the trigger in the baby\u2019s face and blows out its brains. Artistic, wasn\u2019t it? By the way, Turks are particularly fond of sweet things, they say.\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cBrother, what are you driving at?\u201d asked Alyosha.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cI think if the devil doesn\u2019t exist, but man has created him, he has created him in his own image and likeness.\u201d</span>",

No, I do not object to soul-searching and self-revelation, but in those books the soul, and the sins, and the sentimentality, and the journalese, hardly warrant the tedious and muddled search. Dostoyevsky\u2019s lack of taste, his monotonous dealings with persons suffering with pre-Freudian complexes, the way he has of wallowing in the tragic misadventures of human dignity \u2013 all this is difficult to admire. I do not like this trick his characters have of \u201dsinning their way to Jesus\u201d or, as a Russian author, Ivan Bunin, put it more bluntly, \u201dspilling Jesus all over the place.&quot; Crime and Punishment\u2019s plot did not seem as incredibly banal in 1866 when the book was written as it does now when noble prostitutes are apt to be received a little cynically by experienced readers. Dostoyevsky never really got over the influence which the European mystery novel and the sentimental novel made upon him. The sentimental influence implied that kind of conflict he liked\u2014placing virtuous people in pathetic situations and then extracting from these situations the last ounce of pathos. Non-Russian readers do not realize two things: that not all Russians love Dostoevsky as much as Americans do, and that most of those Russians who do, venerate him as a mystic and not as an artist. He was a prophet, a claptrap journalist and a slapdash comedian. I admit that some of his scenes, some of his tremendous farcical rows are extraordinarily amusing. But his sensitive murderers and soulful prostitutes are not to be endured for one moment\u2014by this reader anyway. Dostoyevsky seems to have been chosen by the destiny of Russian letters to become Russia\u2019s greatest playwright, but he took the wrong turning and wrote novels.",

Basically what I would posit is that the novel was a phase, whereas poetry is eternal. The ability for stories to be told on a screen has supplanted a lot of prose fiction&#039;s power, in the past it was the only option. This is especially the case as we increasingly become cyborgs and so much of our time is spent online. How are you supposed to realistically convey a day in the average person&#039;s life when it consists of gooning on X and updooting on reddit? In the past the novel could show conversations over a distance very eloquently, because people wrote very literate letters to each other. Now the average person is a subhuman who sends a string of emojis or reaction gifs. It&#039;s very easy for a camera to show a phone or computer screen, but a writer sounds retarded if they have to say &quot;Jayden sent five fire emojis with one laughingcrying emoji and added &#039;Fr bruh&#039;.&quot; But at the same time if you don&#039;t show the digital part of a person&#039;s life, which these days is like 85% of it, you&#039;re simply conceding that you&#039;re not capable of rendering a full picture. The camera also has the advantage of focusing on exteriority, we can simply take it on faith that people are also online. Whereas the novel is primarily about interiority, if you&#039;re going to realistically show someone&#039;s thought processes you can&#039;t leave out that most of it relates to content they see on a screen. Beyond this, a screen is far more capable of achieving scope and kinetic effect. This is why any sword and sorcery slop can be elevated to legitimate cinema. You can read &quot;Dany had a dragon that went woosh&quot; or you can see the fucking dragon and hear it go woosh and go holy shit, that&#039;s a dragon. So both actual literature (which is interior) and genre fiction (more about action) are no longer capable of competing with stories on screen, which is not hampered by the need to translate the digital world into undignified description, while also outmatching words for kinetic effect. This is why modern novels, like Sally Rooney&#039;s, are increasingly spare in description and light in substance. People who grow up reading classic novels still dream of being novelists so that&#039;s what they try to do, unaware of the fact that it&#039;s over. The only way to write a legitimate novel anymore is for it to be Period, but once you concede that fact the question you have to ask is why even keep the medium alive at all. Just become a writer-director and do what you want.</span><br>This doesn&#039;t mean literature as a whole is over. Poetry preceded the novel and will still be here after. There is no medium that could replace it, whereas storytelling has a spectrum of options: novel, stage, screen. Literature will soon be exclusively poetry, and once again the pastime of a literate elite.",

This is so, partly because it then takes unobstructed possession of the hearer&#039;s whole soul, and leaves him no by-thought to distract him; partly, also, because he feels that here he is not being corrupted or cheated by the arts of rhetoric, but that all the effect of what is said comes from the thing itself. For instance, what declamation on the vanity of human existence could ever be more telling than the words of Job? Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live and is full of misery. He cometh up, and is cut down, like a flower; he fleeth as it were a shadow, and never continueth in one stay.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For the same reason Goethe&#039;s na\u00efve poetry is incomparably greater than Schiller&#039;s rhetoric. It is this, again, that makes many popular songs so affecting. As in architecture an excess of decoration is to be avoided, so in the art of literature a writer must guard against all rhetorical finery, all useless amplification, and all superfluity of expression in general; in a word, he must strive after chastity of style. Every word that can be spared is hurtful if it remains. The law of simplicity and na\u00efvet\u00e9 holds good of all fine art; for it is quite possible to be at once simple and sublime.</span>",

Even 4chan can get you censored when you&#039;re too flagrant. Sure you can say nigger and faggot but that&#039;s about the biggest difference between current day 4chan and twitter.

There are so many people, even the more liberally minded who are so fucking fatigued with woke and it&#039;s resulting anti-woke grifting, that I think the moralfagging millenials and soulless corporatists who would cancel you will not be able to so in a couple of years or so. Maybe this anon<a href=\"#p24572772\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;24572772</a> is right when he says that 4chan is becoming a legacy website, were the idea of 4chan has a greater impact then what 4chan actually does now.",

I blame me waiting until 100+ch before starting patreon, but it&#039;s slowly been increasing.</span><br>As far as I heard, that&#039;s normal, you can expect between 1-5% patron conversion rate.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The reason being is all my patrons basically stop commenting/reading the story on RR after subbing. Not a problem because money&gt;comments but I&#039;m now down to roughly 10 comments a chapter because so many have swapped to patrons. Makes me sad.</span><br>Do they comment in Patreon? Have you been running a discord channel? Maybe you could use these venues, maybe you could entice more to join by making a &quot;patron only channel&quot; or something, but I wouldn&#039;t know as I never patroned a story personally.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For anyone who has finished a story (or started a second while first was ongoing) how was your conversion rate?</span><br>I plan to, will post results once I do.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Other question is just what are your average view on your new chapters the first couple days from upload. I average 250.</span><br>For my short story, I think I got ~20-30 after a few hours? It would double after like 12 hours, but it would fizzle out pretty fast. Not the usual RR author experience as my story was both short, didn&#039;t have a good cover and was off-meta, basically worst case type.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I think roughly 50 avg views on every chapter are bots personally</span><br>I would be very sad indeed if that&#039;s the case! But ~9 anons did read my story, so that ok.",

Don&#039;t take my word for it, take it with a grain of salt. Same thing happened with the mobile app, was a thing in development for years.<br><br>I have very flawed information, but I&#039;ll try to answer your questions.<br><br>1. I started Superflux last year but didn\u2019t bother posting until January. I stuck with it for months. It took me two months to get my first patron; after that, things got easier. I peaked at $50 with around 17 patrons coming and going. I can&#039;t give you exact numbers, but I had roughly 250 followers at the time. (I lost patreons, because burn out, it was just too much to handle for a first time author.)<br><br>One of my plans for this year, which I&#039;ve now moved to next year, was to create bait-and-switch novels purely to drive traffic to Superflux. A cost-free but heavily worked ad, so to speak. This got two of my stories into Genre Rising Stars, but I struggled to maintain momentum. A &quot;big&quot; author I won\u2019t name ghosted my shoutout, and I gave up on pushing the second story to RS Main, so I stopped writing it. Still, the experiment paid off. It pushed Superflux a few steps up the RS ladder. I think I crossed the 300\u2013500 page mark around then, and followers started flooding in.<br><br>2. I quit recently, but at the time I was getting anywhere from 100 to 300 views depending on the time zone and allotted hours.<br><br>My take on weird numbers. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s bots. It&#039;s a combination of lurkers, people who lock the tab in their browsers, and people who keep rereading. People won&#039;t always catchup or try to read what you wrote. Your core readers is different than your average readers and your followers.<br><br>Dunno if that helped you much. If you&#039;re after patreons, definitely try and replicate what goes on in the RS Main catalogue. No history authors dominating the playing field. <br><br>If I can ask, do you make use of external sites. I.e. Scribblehub?",

Put out an &quot;Architect needed for big modern library&quot; ad and when all the art school faggots who want to make it into a brutalist prison or glass funhouse, they get sliced. Then hire a real architect with experience making real buildings, ones people actually like being in. It should feel like when people actually went to the library to do research back in the day, like pic related. The chairs should be comfy and the hall should be well lit but not in that depressing &quot;abstract public space&quot; way where it&#039;s meant to be easy to hose off the hobo piss at the end of the day. It should be old-timey but not too old-timey. There should be various different study rooms for people who like different kinds of rooms with different lighting conditions, and a covered rooftop study area, and weird nooks for autistic people who like to study in nooks, and even little balconies for people who want to study on a little balcony. There should be offices and carrels you can rent for cheap, and if you abuse them you get sliced. There should be an info desk AND a circulation desk, and the circulation desk people should be nice and polite and not weird old crotchety fucks or bitchy women or unaccountably uppity blacks, and the info desk people should be proper librarians who can teach people how to do research by answering queries and showing the process on a dual monitor setup. There will be NO public computers in the library, so the library won&#039;t feel like a cheap gaudy rundown shithole with aging broken computers, but people can bring their laptops. There will be ONE cafe, and it will have fast service and be separated from the quiet areas so you can talk in there, and the coffee will be very cheap and good, and everybody who works there will be polite and not an uppity black or snooty woman. Different floors will have different kinds of chairs so you can find out which floor has the best chairs for you.

The major local library has an open-air plan exactly like that, and what this does in practice, is it guarantees that EVERYONE in the entire building gets distracted and bothered and EVERYBODY gets to hear it when one of the feral schizos starts acting out, shouting into the all-commnicating void as security boots them out. literal man-hours of study and retention: lost. Day: ruined. Even assuming a well-behaved society, I would still oppose such plans for libraries, for the basic noise communicating reason.<br><br>This sort of thing is a perfect example of the architect wanting to show off their own acumen, and not paying serious attention to what the building is for. A more classical style with enclosed rooms, divided floors and more compartmentalized spaces would be preferable. Not for the usual chud reasons to enjoy classical architecture, but for the more practical reason that such a design helps to baffle noise and keep things fucking QUIET. Designers in general hate books-as-objects, because a book collection or library represents a block of physical stuff that they either feel a need to get rid of altogether to do a re-design (which, to be fair, is their whole job), or if they can&#039;t, they feel a need to &quot;design around&quot; the blocks of bookshelves. Put their own touch on things.<br><br>I don&#039;t mind modernist architecture. In fact, I enjoy some brutalist buildings precisely because they get such a visceral negative reaction out of normies and the non-autistic.

If there were any disputes over books the disputers would gather around the book they&#039;re disputing and talk it out peacefully. The only librarians would be kindly old black women. No eye contact allowed unless you&#039;re debating, and there are no chairs or places to recline, just the floor.",

Every book is still on its own table and on one floor, but it&#039;s no longer an open-air space. A huge semi-transparent canvas is put over the entire floor to cover it from snow, and the floor is transformed into ice. To ensure nobody slips on the ice every third row will have a transport zamboni pulling a personal-size chariot playing soft christmas music which anybody can hitch a ride on. The coffee machines will be swapped out for hot chocolate machines. Anyone can write to the library from November 25th until December 15th in order to stock their favorite book, which would be a free christmas gift for all library members (you can take it home with you). The feline pest control team is replaced by a different feline species that can stand the cold better. Instead of philosophers, Christians would be permitted to come to the library and tel labout the birth of Jesus. The librarians would wear Christmas dresses. There is still nowhere to sit, so patrons would go back in the chariot.",

Politics itself means &quot;politike,&quot; &quot;the skilled/reasoned art of the polis.&quot; The bones and sinews of political life are like an old-growth tree and every layer is European. America went to complete shit within 1-2 generations of its founding but it was one of the most fascinating deliberate experiments in state-founding in human history. And it was founded as a white, European state. The Founders never intended for &quot;inferior&quot; peoples to inhabit it even if their definition of superiority/inferiority was hazy and instinctive. They did not want Africans to stay in America and regretted slavery both as an immoral and unnecessary institution, and as a danger, distraction, and burden in the heart of this new society. <br><br>Americans meddled in the affairs of others in the same way every state has: China literally calls itself &quot;The Middle Kingdom&quot; because it historically saw itself as the kingdom at the center of the world. Its entire way of visualizing the world was: you&#039;re either China at the center, or non-China on the periphery, and then you owe tribute to China and should also get your culture from China. Islamic states were all slave economies built on imperial conquest and governed according to Roman legal conceptions of imperium. The first thing the first Islamic Caliphate did was try to conquer as far as it possibly could into India, Europe, and Africa, repeatedly, for centuries, and it controlled Spain, Sicily, and even parts of late Merovingian France for generations or centuries. The LAST Islamic Caliphate was openly imperialistic and exhausted itself trying to conquer Europe, while sponsoring slaver-pirates to enslave Europeans and formalizing enslavement as an administrative technique (slave soldiers, slave administrators). Down to the late 19th century it was still meddling in the affairs of Balkan and Arab countries while viewing them as inferiors. Every state does things like this. <br><br>The only reason you have such ressentiment against whites is because whites did it better than everyone else. The Ottomans were a bricolage empire, but Europeans took the classical heritage and actually developed it into something new and yet faithful to the tradition. As Europeans expanded they did what everybody else did. The difference is that Europeans hauled humanity into collective greatness by sharing their own greatness in the process.",

They draw the entirety of their modern culture from niggers. They post sassy gifs about niggers. They watch sportsball in worship of niggers. Their biggest event of the year involves throwing parties in honor of niggers playing sports. They use nigger slang like &quot;bruh&quot; and &quot;thot&quot;. When you say &quot;Martin Luther&quot; they&#039;re not thinking of the father of protestantism. They&#039;re thinking of the nigger. Their cities are completely overrun with niggers. They worship their ZOGbot police force disproportionately filled with niggers and their global police force of soldiers filled with niggers. Their men sit around watching nigger ball while their women sit around watching nigger talk shows. They worship niggers like Muhammad Ali and Michael Jordan and Michael Jackson and the late Eddie Murphy while attacking the whites who actually built their country before niggers took over. Their movies are filled with niggers and their music charts are topped by niggers. They send niggers to the Olympics and celebrate when the niggers win because those niggers are true red blooded american niggers. They watch nigger porn to a point where &quot;BBC&quot; does not make them think of an international media company but about nigger penises instead. They will tell you how much they hate niggers and how the mutt&#039;s law meme is a stale joke and they are just pretending to love niggers but the evidence speaks for itself in that America has always been and will be a nation of nigger loving niggers.<br><br>Niggers are America&#039;s gods. Americans fear niggers like a mortal would fear God. They&#039;re not allowed to curse or speak ill of niggers, like how you mustn&#039;t blaspheme God or take His name in vain. They devote entire institutions in academia and media to remind themselves of their sins against niggers and beg for mercy, like you&#039;d beg God for forgiveness for your sins. The only landmarks and monuments they&#039;re allowed to revere are parks, schools and statues dedicated to famous niggers, immortalized in marble like gods. While their ancestors expressed devotion to gods through offerings of food and drink, present-day Americans created food stamps for niggers for this very purpose. Jesus gets two annual days of reverence, while niggers get an entire month plus MLK&#039;s birthday. Americans prostrate themselves in the streets to appease niggers. This is because nigger worship is the official religion of America.",

You see, people both in China and abroad boast about how China has 5,000 years of continuous history, but logically thinking, it does not make sense that a present-day culture would have been retained most things from it was millenias ago. All cultures develop and decay, China is no exception. <br><br>Since late Qing (itself a Manchu-hijacked dynasty that had been around for 200 years), Confucianism and the traditional Chinese worldview as a whole had been in continuous clash with the Western mindset, since then the &quot;educated&quot; intellectuals in China have been obsessed with &quot;progress&quot; and modernization, with a lot of self-hatred. Lu Xun even famously proclaimed that Hanzi must be abolished for China to survive. The culmination of this line of thought resulted in the creation of simplified script and the cultural revolution, where many temples and statues of ancient figures were brutally destroyed, even some of their graves were dug up.<br><br>Then the US looked at China&#039;s one billion people and thought it would be a good idea to use them to integrate into the world market and profit from the industrial chain. The one-child policy was born out of this, what <a href=\"#p24567233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;24567233</a> said is wrong and it had detrimental impact on China. Post-Deng China is basically focusing on short-term development and material growth, at the expense of opportunities for younger future generations.<br><br>I could have elaborated more, but I think you can fill out the rest of what I want to say.

To Xi, this means tightening the reins on the inside because he saw the USSR try to liberalize during its decline and it just accelerated its demise. <br>These two events explain most of China&#039;s domestic and foreign policy. Why does China engage in IP theft? Because it had western technology leveraged against it for 250 years. Why is Xi building a cult of personality like Mao? Because purging his rivals and propagandizing loyalty in the populace fosters stability. Why is China&#039;s foreign policy so aggressive? &quot;We&#039;re the Middle Kingdom, fuck you. We were the center of the world for 8000 years. The West&#039;s 300 years on dominance have just been an embarrassing blip that will be corrected shortly.&quot; To fail is to invite another Century of Humiliation.",

However, the general theme of liberal democracy, even if it&#039;s flawed, has been one of the foundations of these ties. Liberal democracies rarely go to war with one another while autocracies don&#039;t have such a common affinity. Like I said, this is a very general, non-exhaustive explanation but working out the nuances to cover every base would be wasted on 4chan. <br>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dem<wbr>ocratic_peace_theory",

Now China does that with their own history to encourage &quot;red tourism.&quot; He also thought the U.S. allowed for radically different people to co-exist in the same country after visiting the Amish.

But there&#039;s also emphasis on humaneness and benevolence, and also the ritual (and political ritual). It&#039;s a set of ritual that holds a society together more than any system of law. The truly &quot;ren&quot; (or truly human person) is someone who performs the ritual in a way that is paradoxically both perfectly rehearsed, but also effortless and spontaneous, and beautiful. He believed that music, when performed correctly, could inspire positive emotions, foster unity, and contribute to a well-ordered society.

After successfully leaving a ransom note and directing the killer to leave ten thousand dollars at a dropspot, the protagonist is apprehended by the killer when he later goes to collect. The killer is surprised to find his blackmailer is a foul mouth teenager and instead of tying up loose ends decides to &#039;dirty the hands&#039; of his blackmailer, involving him in several petty crimes. The book follows some of their misadventures, moments of philosophy discussed by the two, the killer increasingly seeing more of his former self in the teenager, and culminates in the killer preparing the protagonist to kill someone on his own; only to decide it better to die at the hands of his own criminal organization than to implicate the teenager any further.",

There\u2019s no reason to start anywhere else.<br>It was the first novel he ever wrote, and when he thought it had been lost he spent the rest of his career splintering the scenes and ideas into separate narratives, with a lot less joi de vivre because losing his original masterpiece sucked the soul out of him. Everything else he wrote pales in comparison to the 120 Days.<br>That doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t still worth reading themselves, just not to begin with. <br>Something Sade liked to do was pretend to have a moral, so that his stories could be more digestible. This is especially apparent in Crimes of Love, where sometimes he even concludes a story by pretending to be a Christian and saying \u201cSo as difficult as this was for me to write, let\u2019s all learn from this and be better Christians!! God bless!!\u201d He also did this to a less ridiculous degree in Justine and most other works, where he pretended to be an \u201cintellectual\u201d with a biting analogy rather than just a pornographer, so that, again, it would be more digestible. This is why Justine is usually the critical touchstone for evaluating him and was printed by Oxford long before Penguin printed the 120 Days. It has intellectual trappings and more of an excuse to exist. But it\u2019s also very diluted.<br>Pure undistilled Sade is in the 120 Days.",

        "com": "Schopenhauer explains why one should never let anyone know that you have a high IQs. Did you ever wonder why the midwits and low-IQs always get nasty when the topic comes up? Because:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Now, there is nothing of which a man is prouder than of intellectual ability, for it is this that gives him his commanding place in the animal world.</span><br>Basically, your intelligence is the ultimate spec for a human being, and everyone perceives this intuitively. No one goes crazy if they see someone who looks better or who has a good body. So why do they get nasty in response?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; he will then thirst for vengeance, and generally look about for an opportunity of taking it by means of insult, because this is to pass from the sphere of intellect to that of will \u2014 and there, ALL ARE ON AN EQUAL FOOTING as regards the feeling of hostility.</span><br>Another absolute truth-bomb. To continue, he explains that IQ is worse even than being rich in the eyes of the masses because while being rich . High-status obliges a certain level of social standing, a high-IQ gets none of that, yet is just as evil for possessing it:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; A man may be as humble as possible in his demeanor, and yet hardly ever get people to overlook his crime in standing intellectually above them.</span>",

Is intelligence not knowledge itself but your capacity to understand, retain and gather knowledge? Is someone that knows a lot automatically intelligent? What about someone with autistic amounts of scientific knowledge thats incapable of understanding and navigating even the most basic social interaction? Is that truly intelligent? What about intellect? Is that more about pattern recognition in the knowledge you have access to? To categorize and arrange the moving pieces in a coherent way? I don\u2018t get it to be honest.

        "com": "I made this thread to explain to other high-IQs why the midwits and low-IQs go wild with rage at the mention of having a higher-IQ. In fact they can just tell when someone is smarter than they are based on nothing more than the language and complexity of the post, but to have it directly called out is really too much for them. Intelligence is almost entirely genetic, as is attractiveness, but yet the amount of envy hatred directed towards attractive people pales in comparison to how much high-IQs are hated. The reality is, intelligence is the primary spec for the human being, because it\u2019s out INT stat which separates us from animals. If you\u2019re a high-IQ you have definitely felt like you are living amongst barely-sentient animals. This difference in status is so great that the lower-intelligent feel it intuitively, and because the only way they can level themselves with the higher-intelligent is to engage emotionally instead of intellectually. Because, obviously, the low-IQ CAN\u2019T engage intellectually. Wanting to associate with even smarter people is the mindset of high-IQs only. It\u2019s mentally enriching only to other smart people. Low-IQs will only feel small and that they don\u2019t belong in such company, and negative envy arises.<br><br>For example, if you saw a picture of a ripped bodybuilder, how do you feel? Do you want to be like him, or do you sneer at them over steroids? I believe (can\u2019t prove) that if you look at him positively, ie, \u201cwow I want to be like him\u201d you have a higher IQ than one who thinks \u201csome California beach fag who\u2019s going to die from steroid abuse, their nutrition and lifestyle is actually trash, most of the effect is just diuretics and oil, etc\u201d.",

People with low IQs can only think in terms of &#039;this&#039; and &#039;that&#039;, like a child or a woman, and accordingly they gravitate to boring but ostensibly practical philosophers who give them real life advice and direction, which they desperately need because of how dense they are. If the low IQ midwit is also an awful human being, he will fall in with Schopenhauer.

You mention Hegel, interestingly enough he appears to have retroactively refuted Schopenhauer right here:<br>&quot;Reason is the certainty of being all reality. However, this in-itself, or this reality, is still for all intents and purposes a universal, the pure abstraction of reality. It is the first positivity in which self-consciousness is in itself as it is for itself, and thus the I is only the pure essentiality of the existing, or the simple category. The category which otherwise signified the essentiality of the existing, where it was indeterminate if that meant the essentiality of what is existing, in general, or what is existing as confronting consciousness, is now the essentiality, or the simple unity of the existing only as a thinking actuality. Or, to put it differently, the category is this: Self-consciousness and being are the same essence, or the same not in comparison with each other, but rather the same in and for itself. It is only a on-sided, bad idealism which lets this unity again come on the scene as consciousness on one side and an in-itself confronting it on the other side.&quot;<br><br>I&#039;d gloss it for you and explain how it refutes Schopenhauer, not in a superficial way but absolutely, but then I remember you have a very high IQ so it should be no problem for you.",

Natural philosophizing, which holds itself to be too good for the concept and which through this deficiency takes itself to be an intuitive and poetical thinking, trades in the arbitrary combinations of an imagination which is quite simply disorganized by its own thoughts.&quot;",

Reading a foreign language is always going to involve a spectrum with instinctively recognizable things on one side, extremely obscure unrecognizable forms requiring special glossing on the other (with untranslateable hapax legomena being the extreme case), and stuff requiring a bit of thought populating the middle of the spectrum.

Where did you read that? In the context of reading, it probably means that you should strive to understand the meaning of a Latin sentence by reading it from the beginning to end in the Latin word order without translating the parts of it into English. That doesn&#039;t have to mean that you can&#039;t ever analyze a Latin sentence using English, but it shouldn&#039;t be the first tool you reach for. If you read through a sentence that was unclear, you might have realized that you misstepped as you were reading it, and it might be sufficient simply to go back to the beginning and read it through again. If the syntax of the sentence is unclear, read it through again more slowly and try to pay more attention to what parts go together and the constructions used, how it might have been punctuated to make the right interpretation clearer. Generally speaking it&#039;s only after this manner of analysis that I would consider reaching for your Latin-English dictionary. The method of &quot;first find the verb...&quot; and using that to mindlessly produce a translation (alluded to in <a href=\"#p24570536\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;24570536</a>) should be avoided altogether.<br><br>What you do want to avoid is a method of reading which equates understanding with translating. One method of teaching, which I know exists because I have seen it first-hand, and I suspect is very common, is to have the students take turns reading the Latin sentence aloud and then offering an English translation. It&#039;s obvious why classes are conducted this way. It&#039;s because the students are bad at Latin and are reading texts that are too hard, and it is really doubtful that the students can understand what they&#039;re reading, so the production of a correct English translation is necessary to prove that the students understand it, and it&#039;s necessary that there be an English translation communicated aloud to all the other students so the meaning of the Latin is made clear. And at the same time, the teachers of such classes will say that consulting an English translation of the text outside of class is &quot;cheating.&quot; Judge for yourself whether this method of teaching Latin makes sense.<br><br>Along those lines, you don&#039;t need to translate everything into English to prove to yourself that you understand it.",

ALso, consider that the advice &quot;don&#039;t translate&quot; could also be directed to beginners self-studying Latin who don&#039;t have any idea what they should be doing. They might go for instance through a book like Wheelock&#039;s, where the exercises are primarily translating sentences from Latin into English and English into Latin (at least as I recall), then they get dumped into reading material that is too difficult for them, and the only way to proceed is to translate into English one sentence at a time. If you actually stick to this method long enough and review the texts you&#039;ve already worked through by translation, you&#039;ll hopefully pick up enough vocabulary and feel for syntax that you can eventually read without the crutches, but most students finish their Latin classes long before they get to that point.",

And you very well may know all this, so I don&#039;t mean to talk down to you.<br><br>ALG is something I never heard of until this year, but is a pedagogical theory developed by some professor of the Thai language. His ideas are extreme because he said that any conscious formal study of a language harms our ability to natively acquire it. Even if that&#039;s true (as far as I know, this was all merely conjecture on his part, and supported at best by his limited anecdotal experiences), this isn&#039;t practical for Latin because we just don&#039;t have the resources to CI our way to fluency. That said, I do find the teaching style he developed interesting, which consists of two (ideally native) speakers of the target language teaching via dialogue with each other. Some examples can be found on the &quot;algworld&quot; channel.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Ma<wbr>rvin_Brown<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-8<wbr>mzEM82-M<br><br>CI (comprehensible input) can mean different things, but in it&#039;s most basic sense, it literally just means input that is comprehensible (i.e., that can be understood). I&#039;m not sure what&#039;s so objectionable about that, or about Stephen Krashen&#039;s ideas. &quot;CI&quot; can also refer to certain pedagogical methods, which can be implemented badly or not. The &quot;natural method&quot; (which I understand most properly to refer to a particular movement, beginning somewhere around the latter part of the 19th century) could very much be considered &quot;CI cultism,&quot; because (1) it prescribed teaching classes in the target language from the beginning using easily understood messages (checking the box for &quot;CI&quot;), and (2) it was a reactionary ideological movement against the grammar-translation type of pedagogy that was dominant of the time (checking the box for &quot;cultism&quot;). I&#039;ve posted about Sauveur before, and Rouse is another notable figure in that movement.<br><br>Orberg (and Arthur Jensen) use the term &quot;nature method&quot; (note the subtle difference). I&#039;m not sure if that subtle difference was intentional, or how much they saw their books as part of the original &quot;natural method&quot; movement or not. These (&quot;by the nature method&quot;) books are a step away from a &quot;CI classroom.&quot; I believe Rouse gave the specific example that a &quot;natural method&quot; teacher would Teaching a Greek word for &quot;walking&quot; by having the teacher say the word and walk around the classroom. It seems that the original &quot;natural method&quot; movement was primarily focused on the classroom, while the &quot;nature method&quot; books were designed primarily for self-study.<br><br>And then there is William Most&#039;s &quot;Latin by the Natural Method,&quot; for whom &quot;natural method&quot; mainly just seems to mean large quantities of simple Latin input, and incorporating some degree of oral Latin in the classroom. His books don&#039;t teach vocabulary or grammar didactically via the text in the same way that LLPSI does.",

A lot of people talking about natural method seem to think of Latin as any modern language to casually talk and write in, whereas more traditional approaches aim at a refined understanding of the authors, even at the cost of fluency. The Accademia Vivarium Novum itself is not an institution where Latin and Greek are taught per se, they state explicitly that the languages are mere instruments in the service of a broader humanist curriculum, designed to cultivate a wide-ranging culture akin in spirit to that of the polymaths of the sixteenth century. This presupposes a general, non-academic familiarity with the authors. Notions such as \u201creading and translating even without understanding a word or two\u201d run counter to the objective of most traditional classics curricula in university, which are oriented towards in-depth textual analysis, detailed stylistic discussion, and highly structured translation exercises that prioritise comprehension and insight into the text. Think of learning French to go on vacation in France or work there, as opposed to learning French to study Baudelaire or Rimbaud.",

Most called his method the Natural Method while Orberg published via the Nature Method Institute. I really was referring to both of these books, I think they&#039;re both great. They&#039;re a good example of a high volume of input with a light (but still highly important) amount of grammar study, with grammar introduced incrementally through the context of the input in the text, rather than systematically trying to memorize paradigms. IMO remembering paradigms is still really helpful, it&#039;s just not something you need a textbook to do, literally just typing out a declension paradigm and then chanting it to yourself until you remember it is plenty. But this still fits the general model of the Nature method and the Natural method, because it&#039;s like 5 minutes of grammar practice for every hour of input.",

Most puts it in his preface puts it best. He based his method off the traditional Late Medieval method of *elementary* Latin education, where students mainly learned words via engaging with easy texts designed for them until they had a solid basic grasp of the lexicon and could somewhat intuitively grasp the grammar. In the long term, students were still supposed to study the great Latin grammatical works and to deeply analyze these texts, but for the first few years it was just getting a general grasp of the language.<br><br>So for a modern learner, we look at the deep grammar knowledge and analytical ability of someone who has been learning and working with Latin since the age of 8, and assume we need to start analyzing his level of Latin and his advanced grammar, while forgetting that these great Latinists of yesteryear were themselves once beginners, and learned the language via beginner&#039;s texts and learning the lexicon. Basically, just because a 14th-15th century scholar could deeply analyze Cicero, doesn&#039;t mean he *started* with Cicero, nor does it mean you should either.<br><br>Fr. Most&#039;s texts are intended to be worked through in a 3 year university course, if I&#039;m not mistaken, but even that still teaches a wealth of grammar and syntax, it just teaches it incrementally. Similarly, LLPSI is not meant to be an end all be all, but merely an introductory text to create a basic and intuitive fluency in Latin, it still has explicit grammar explanations (in Latin, mind you) and exercises to test the grammar.",

Sorel immediately diagnosed the problem, not vaguely but precisely with a good understanding of how and why Marx was wrong, and reasserted voluntarism on logically consequent grounds. Bernstein was also perfectly logically consequent in his ethical grounding of socialism but the &quot;orthodox&quot; Marxist&#039;s reply, that only fatalistic scientific socialism provides the necessary alchemical transformation of the bourgeois &quot;ought&quot; into the Marxist &quot;is,&quot; technically can&#039;t be disproved by Bernstein from within his own system. Sorel of course accounts for this by saying &quot;As long as the proletariat BELIEVES it&#039;s an &#039;is&#039;, we&#039;re golden.&quot; Rosa Luxemburg is basically just the screaming crying wojak jpg resisting the revisionists and gets killed. <br><br>Lucaks is Sorelian insane like a fox, but an insane fox that doesn&#039;t know he&#039;s insane and is twice as effective because of it, but also too insane to know how effective he is, which is why he both succeeds at turning Marxism-Leninism into a Sorelian battering ram by maximizing its potential, and fails at doing anything with the battering ram because it turns out Marxism-Leninism is retarded for the same reasons Marx was kinda retarded (the fatalism), which is ironic because Lenin is a Blanquist voluntarist and radically anti-fatalist, but then when he achieves all his aims with the infinite power of Blanquist augmentation he reveals that his manic confidence was built on absolute certainy in Marx&#039;s anti-Blanquist fatalism and lapses back into fatalism and Russia implodes into another 18th Brumaire. Adorno et al. are just Gramscians too scared to admit they&#039;re Gramscians so they do nothing and vibrate as de facto bourgeois, while Gramsci fully admits he&#039;s a Gramscian (Sorelian fascist) and is much more influential as a result.. mostly on fascists.",

As a rule of thumb, if a Marxist on the internet think it&#039;s good (like some gay low IQ agrarian Mexican movement that thinly calls itself socialist or some poopoo commune whose first constitutional act was to kill itself) then it&#039;s bad. <br><br>Not only is post-Marxist anti-fatalist Marxian socialism the most interesting Marxism, pre-Marxist socialism (Proudhon, Blanqui, Blanc, many others, including many utopian socialists) are also very interesting and have much more of &quot;Marxism&quot; in them than brainwashed internet Marxists (non-readers) think. And even more interesting is the fact that Marx is full of ambivalence about fatalism vs. voluntarism and you can easily read him against the grain as a voluntarist and even as a Sorelian &quot;as if&quot; fatalist who just wanted the working class to believe hard enough to think communism was a fait accompli, and thus commit to the bit hard enough to push things past a point of no return. He was so traumatized by &#039;48-&#039;49 that he had a &quot;never again&quot; attitude: better to gas all lumpen than let them &quot;elect&quot; a Louis Napoleon or accept a Stalin, and better to kick the proletariat into maximum overdrive, even it leads to a Grande Peur, September Massacre, or Terror, than miss another opportunity to throw the bourgeoisie off-kilter. Marx had a lot of the Blanquist in him, he was just by turns ashamed of its vulgarity and &quot;untheoreticalness&quot; and too autistic to give up the opportunity to be the Seal of the Political Economists (pbuh) and the True Final Hegel.",

I like the concept of Justine but you can get the gist elsewhere.<br><br>I think his philosophy should really be looked at as pornography though. The vast majority of people reading Sade are completely powerless. Even Sade himself, whether he did this shit or not, was either a libertine patsy who got arrested or a pornographer who got arrested. The philosophy parts set up the justification for the erotic scenes, and I think erotic scenes are difficult to pull off without that. It&#039;s like watching &#039;stern teacher disciplines naughty pupil&#039; on pornhub and thinking it&#039;s a guide on how to be a teacher.

The rest all follow the same formula: absurdly unlikely and grotesque things keep happening to &quot;good&quot; people, while &quot;bad&quot; people (aristocrats or clergymen) get away with everything. Everyone in a position of power is corrupt and a rapist. It&#039;s all very black-and-white, comically so.<br><br>And I say this as a pessimist myself: even I find his worldview stupid and shallow. Philosophy in the Boudoir at least tries a different concept: dialogue as a vehicle for libertine philosophy, but it still boils down to people fucking (and pissing, shitting, sewing assholes shut, etc.) while delivering pompous monologues about how their sadism is not only logical, but the most moral path, in fact. These arguments are delivered in typical 18th century fashion: overly confident, barley reasoned, and shallow. It&#039;s always just &quot;this is true because it is&quot;, or some equally flimsy assertion.<br><br>There&#039;s no depth and it&#039;s not interesting. The initial effect might be shock or even humor (you laugh at how over-the-top and ridiculous it all is), but that quickly turns into boredom. There&#039;s absolutely zero literary value: his style isn&#039;t compelling or novel, and his form is sloppy. You read Sade out of morbid curiosity and nothing else. You gain nothing from it. Well, I suppose a serial killer or rapist might find some value in it.",

It&#039;s hard to pick of course, for my list i made an effort to showcase many different lessons/ideas that are dear to me and have changed me, in no particular order for me. INTP schizoid here ; ).<br><br>I find that words fail to do ideas justice at times, but painting a picture with a story gives information that snippets of ideas by themselves couldn&#039;t make. Motifs and symbols are powerful, but the mega-structure they create combined in a certain way paints its own picture, an entire story is a symbol of something to me. Mock me and i will defend my choices ruthlessly, besides maybe TSZ, tells beautiful ideas in a cool framework, but i think many &quot;philosophy&quot; works can fit into that spot for me. Its simply important to me that people have the mindset for exploration and understanding, and nietzsche just feels more relatable than others.",

Poetry is welcomed as well, as are medical books advising their readers on how to make better use of their healthy years.<br>See I&#039;ve been working at a hospital for a while, surrounded by sickness, suffering, and death on a daily basis, but I&#039;ve been rather unfazed by it all. Too wrapped up in my own personal micro-myths and other pieces of business, shutting out that world as just another spoke on the wheel of life. But it shouldn&#039;t be that way. Death is a major event, a soul leaving its vessel, exiting this realm for good. It should, at the very least, get me questioning the way i&#039;ve been living. Don&#039;t want to exit this whole thing with a cold, detached heart.<br>I mostly struggle with understanding how people manage to adapt to their painful conditions after having spent a long time in fine health. I had some respiratory issues recently, and instead of worrying about its causes or its treatment, I was more focused on the possibility of &#039;&#039;losing&#039;&#039; a part of me forever, paranoid about sealing a portion of my time on earth as an irrecuperable waste of gifts, and dreading the idea of being in constant discomfort. These are all very normal parts of living, and I&#039;d like to reduce how neurotic I get about them, due to my sheltered upbringing.<br>Sorry for blogposting, I just don&#039;t have anywhere else to go with these thoughts.",

To become Man at once with us, however, means firstly for the Jew as much as ceasing to be Jew. And this had B\u00d6RNE done.

His anti-semitism was part of an individualist doctrine where the highest goal was to achieve freedom and autonomy. You can see how the Jews are subsumed in their race.",

His guilt is that he has never posited time, has not willed the final goal and the process of the world, has willed neither good nor evil. He thus opposes the will of God, who wills evil as well as good.</span><br>His art criticism is very good because he realizes the greatest works have the greatest depth. His work is actually highly related to Nietzsche because he thinks egoism is moral. Freedom is the great value, and freedom is productivity (always doing good)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fear is the reverse of all will. Forward something, backwards nothing. That is why, when you are walking along a path, it is uncomfortable to turn around suddenly and catch sight of the route you have covered (unidirectionality of time).</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thus I still believe that fear is closely related to immortality; the more the feeling for chaos grows, the more one wants to be cosmos. The nothing is the border of the something, and if a person becomes everything, becomes God, then he has no borders, and no more fear. But probably just before that, he has the last, greatest fear to conquer....</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Courage is the self-confidence of the higher life. Whoever is fully courageous, like Siegfried, is pure and guiltless. That is why courage is associated with the heart; it corresponds to the power of the heartbeat, just as breath corresponds to \u201cconnectedness\u201d (Rappaport), and the quantity of courage that a man has is the surest indicator of his greatness, purity and genius.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fear, however, is mistrust of life, because it still has edges and one can fall into an abyss. Belief in oneself creates courage and hope (that is the ego on the way to being realized).</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The belief that posits eternal life by affirming it in will and thought is the opposite of the feeling of lifelessness; it is the conqueror of fear.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The more superstition a belief contains, however, the more fear there is in it. There is, to be sure, no special, individual belief that is completely free of superstition. In contrast to belief, however, superstition destroys the autonomous personality; it sacrifices it to every accidental, spatio-temporal coincidence of two independent series of events, i.e., sacrifices it to chance. In superstition, a person connects himself functionally to others, negates his own freedom for all time to come, and declares his will and duty to be bound by fate.</span>",

Now a continuum is that which is divisible into parts always capable of subdivision, and a body is that which is every way divisible. A magnitude if divisible one way is a line, if two ways a surface, and if three a body. Beyond these there is no other magnitude, because the three dimensions are all that there are, and that which is divisible in three directions is divisible in all. For, as the Pythagoreans say, the world and all that is in it is determined by the number three, since beginning and middle and end give the number of an &#039;all&#039;, and the number they give is the triad. And so, having taken these three from nature as (so to speak) laws of it, we make further use of the number three in the worship of the Gods.&quot; - Aristotle De Caelo 1",

It&#039;s not because they have &quot;dirt&quot; or some other non-issue, but because he has the instinct that whoever practices authoritarianism is his natural friend, and its successes throughout the world against liberalism also solidify Trump&#039;s power within America. Because the liberal alternative seems so weak and decrepit.<br>Another more edgy example is Netanyahu and Hamas. The game of propping them up to divide and conquer the Palestinians was pretty risky, but it has paid off for his power.

The friend/enemy distinction relates to PUBLIC enemies, not private. The distinction can ONLY be drawn by the State, as a justification for the State&#039;s power of deciding exceptions, i.e. commanding men to kill one another. It is a vehicle for State sovereignty. You are not sovereign. You do not get a say in deciding who is a public friend and who is a public enemy. The only circumstances in which your private friends and enemies are relevant are those in which the state had collapsed or otherwise foregone sovereignty, in which case the friend/enemy distinction is no longer a valid analytical tool anyway.",

Republicans and Democrats are legitimate enemies because their ways of living cannot be reconciled. When friends do politics (which Schmitt would argue are not politics at all) they are simply deciding on how to enact their common understandings. It&#039;s a pragmatic thing. The job of a minister of education, for example should be things like simply figuring out the best ways of teaching the curriculum to children. This is how Finland&#039;s education got so good, although I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if it&#039;s declining now the American culture war has gone global. In a society, instead, where you have enemies cohabiting, then the politics of education are no longer about the most efficient way of enacting the policies that are already obvious for everyone. It becomes a debate. If team red wins, you get creationism and the gender and tranny stuff is ridiculed. If team red blue you get gender and tranny stuff, and creationism is shut down and ridiculed. Living like this inevitably leads to a violent conflict, because the success of one group implies the extinction of the values of the others. Both cannot coexist. It&#039;s two paths going in different directions. This is what Schmitt meant by the political. And it&#039;s of course not only an intra-national thing. The same principle, of course, also applies to whole nations going to war against each other.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;like right now, is russia an enemy or a friend?</span><br>At the moment Russia is an enemy of the liberal order, which is represented to some degree by Republicans and fully by the Democrats. But that&#039;s a complex issue. Even if Republicans and Democrats may be enemies to each other, they may still be a unified block in a different context, but it&#039;s unclear at the moment exactly how unified or split they are on this. They both seem to agree that Ukraine is a friend of the liberal order and should be armed, but the Republican voters may push against it to the point it could become unsustainable, and I imagine even Democrat voters would be against putting American boots on the ground to fight Russians, and the Russians definitely don&#039;t want to fight Americans, so that tell you both nations aren&#039;t all that enemies after all.",

Something Schmitt stresses is that nothing is inherently political. Things become political as they become something people are willing to enact violence for. This is something that can obviously happen organically and the state emerges from it. Not the other way around. If Christians and Muslims started stabbing each other for religious reasons in France then you would have a political situation and a friend enemy distinction regardless of what Macron has to say about it.",

They&#039;re clearly incompetent and selfish!</span><br>The advantage of modern systems is that they are extremely stable. However, the disadvantage is that their stability allows corruption to fester until the system fails in so many places at once that the impact is devastating. <br>Imagine the loss of a single major individual. By distributing responsibility, the system itself stays intact because removing one individual doesn&#039;t generally change the structure of the system as a whole. Normally, this works, but since people are lazy, major components are left to rot because the rest of the system compensates. That&#039;s how corruption sinks in. The corrupt don&#039;t take responsibility or act competently because THEY DON&#039;T HAVE TO. The system works &#039;without them&#039;, they just direct a portion of it.<br>Again, this works.. At first. Then, eventually, you get to the point where there&#039;s a single point of failure for a major portion of the political and economic system: Everyone kept passing the buck, but now there&#039;s too many issues for passing off responsibility to make sense anymore- and nobody else is going to help because they&#039;ve stacked up issues of their own. A fire in one part of a house can be contained. A fire in multiple locations will almost certainly become an inferno- focusing on one issue allows the remainder to become even more problematic.<br>Reform allows this damage to be mitigated and detected ahead of time, but if too many unexpected events happen all at once, an unprepared system can be left crippled and unable to respond, or even keep itself alive. The US national debt, for instance, wouldn&#039;t be nearly as catastrophic if COVID hadn&#039;t reared its ugly head. Whatever you want to assume about the disease, the economic damage was undeniable.<br>This is where we are slowly finding ourselves, if we are not already there. The big problem is that the people that are best equipped to legally change the system to run clean are the same people that benefit from it running dirty. The transition cost/repair cost is too much for them personally to justify to themselves, so they&#039;re basically trying to pretend that things aren&#039;t tied together by duct tape.<br>It&#039;s the tragedy of the commons, where individuals make selfish decisions because they believe they either must or deserve to, dooming everyone.",

Anybody who&#039;s my<br>age or more will remember, there was a sense of hopefulness back then: maybe there was no food, but there were possibilities, there were things that<br>could be done.

That kind of thing didn&#039;t exist at the depths of the Depression; There&#039;s really something qualitatively different about contemporarypoverty, I think. Some of you must share these experiences. I mean, I was a kid back then, so maybe my perspective was different. But I remember<br>when I would go into the apartment of my cousins-you know, broken family, no job, twenty people living in a tiny apartment-somehow it was<br>hopeful.

I remember it well. Like, one of my earliest childhood memories is of taking a trolley car with my mother and seeing the police wade into a strike of women pickets outside a Philadelphia textile mill, and beating them up-that&#039;s a searing memory. And the poverty was extreme: I remember rag-pickers coming to the door begging for money, lots of things like that. So it was not pretty by any means. But it was also not hopeless. Somehow that&#039;s a tremendous difference: the slums are now hopeless, there&#039;s nothing to do except prey on one another.</span><br>Thus according to Chomsky, politics used to be more hopeful",

Even the so-called &quot;slave&quot; and &quot;master&quot; moral code dynamic is a distortion of the natural fraternal nature that exists between members of a collective culture. <br>Why doesn&#039;t this brotherly nature emerge? Because people see each other as &quot;others&quot;. They see their rulers or their subordinates as either monstrous hungry wolves that need to be appeased (not always inaccurate) or as foolish docile sheep (ignoring that those sheep are the people actually accomplishing the majority of useful tasks). However, both of those individuals are simply human. A bullet can and has killed the most powerful individuals on Earth.<br>Suppose you had all the power in the world, both personal and political: You can kill anyone with a wave of your hand, for instance. Your natural instinct will probably be to collect power and wealth for yourself to generate as much pleasure for you now, or to produce as many descendants as possible. Either way, you end up running in place: You always can want more, and even if you are the sire for all of humanity, they may turn on each other just like you turned on your species. No matter what you do with power, you still live in the universe. We&#039;re all stuck in here together. Ramblings about master or slave morality lose their teeth when you really sit down and realize that even if you &quot;win&quot;, you haven&#039;t really gone anywhere.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;people will abandon their rights, because you&#039;ve got to survive</span><br>This is a very typically individualist idea: The idea that the collective takes away rights. But WHY does &quot;the collective&quot; take away an individual&#039;s rights? Because that collective does not see the individual as part of their collective. They&#039;re not family, so to speak.<br>This is the real hat trick: Getting everyone to speak as if they&#039;re a collective but act as if they&#039;re an individual. When you do this, the small group that is coordinated (the rulers) can do as they like, because when they attack a dangerous individual, everyone else will step aside out of their own self-interest. Anyone threatening to the rulers is threatening to themselves, after all. The obvious hypocrisy of collectives being dominated by individuals is demonstrated best through dictatorships: The reason why those in power allow the dictator to dominate them is because they want to make sure the powers of the dictator would be retained for themselves, as they aspire to take control.<br>The atomization of the individual, far from supporting democratic ideals, is the foundation of enslavement and empire. It makes every man a nation of one.<br>Distance, apparent differences between people, as well as arguments about priorities and an understanding of the situation make this kind of conflict and, therefore, rule, emerge. By pitting different factions against one another, you can command everyone even when nobody wants you in charge.",

I mean, the way it&#039;s used, being an &quot;intellectual&quot; has virtually nothing to do with working with your mind: those are two different things. My suspicion is that plenty of people in the crafts, auto mechanics and so on, probably do as much or more intellectual work as plenty of people in universities. There are big areas in academia where what&#039;s called &quot;scholarly&quot; work is just clerical work, and I don&#039;t think clerical work&#039;s more challenging mentally than fixing an automobile engine-in fact, I think the opposite: I can do clerical work, I can never figure out how to fix an automobile engine.</span>",

If you toss in Durkheim you can easily see why this rarely happens anymore but I doubt his optimism and ideas about moral solidarity re-emerging are still tossed around. The only reason I&#039;m conjecturing Weber will resurface is due to the prevailing attitude across all political spectra that bureacratization and nationalization are signs of of some progress and when filtered down to an individual level seem to possess a sort of divine mandate but this includes willful ignorance on all parties of history and the only outcome is bleak uncertainty.

Everyone else in my class hated it and I&#039;m pretty sure most students just don&#039;t read books at all anymore. Many U.S. states are at below 5th grade reading levels for most graduating students today. <br><br>Here is a great passage from The Beautiful and Damned<br><br>Once upon a time all the men of mind and genius in the world became of one belief\u2014that is to say, of no belief. But it wearied them to think that within a few years after their death many cults and systems and prognostications would be ascribed to them which they had never meditated nor intended. So they said to one another: &quot;&#039;Let&#039;s join together and make a great book that will last forever to mock the credulity of man. Let&#039;s persuade our more erotic poets to write about the delights of the flesh, and induce some of our robust journalists to contribute stories of famous amours. We&#039;ll include all the most preposterous old wives&#039; tales now current. We&#039;ll choose the keenest satirist alive to compile a deity from all the deities worshipped by mankind, a deity who will be more magnificent than any of them, and yet so weakly human that he&#039;ll become a byword for laughter the world over\u2014and we&#039;ll ascribe to him all sorts of jokes and vanities and rages, in which he&#039;ll be supposed to indulge for his own diversion, so that the people will read our book and ponder it, and there&#039;ll be no more nonsense in the world. &quot;&#039;Finally, let us take care that the book possesses all the virtues of style, so that it may last forever as a witness to our profound scepticism and our universal irony.&#039; &quot;So the men did, and they died. &quot;But the book lived always, so beautifully had it been written, and so astounding the quality of imagination with which these men of mind and genius had endowed it. They had neglected to give it a name, but after they were dead it became known as the Bible.",

But of these three, the heaviest workload is easily redrawing.

It&#039;s the same with writing but imagine only writing 100 words a day and how long it would take to complete your novel. The realization would dawn on you, eventually that realization would include acknowledging the budget (feeding and sheltering yourself), the low chance of reaping any kind of significant reward for your labor... the idea to give up becomes quite persuasive and is only counter balanced by things like the sunken cost fallacy (which would require the artist realize how much work it will be too late into production).",

I do read them. I know they&#039;re problematic and I make no excuses for Martin. He ignores mothers too much, he writes about violence against women in a way that&#039;s excessive and the constant sexualization of children is weird to say the least but I don&#039;t think you should judge a book on it&#039;s failures alone. There is so much to love. Like how Martin explores trauma in an authentic way. One of my favorite chapters is Forsaken which explores Damphair who was molested by his brother and how that horrific event haunts him. I can relate because I was violently raped by my own uncle. Many times. It was relentless. He was so brutal to my ass, I still can&#039;t shit like a normal person. Damphair and Victarion, another based character, really capture what it&#039;s like to be fucked in the ass against your will. You should give those books a shot. They&#039;re really good once you get past the constant pedophilia.</span>",

Northern food stores must be pretty big but I doubt its gonna last 5 or 10 years so that only leaves trading stuff for food. What does the North even produce to trade food for?

LotR mentions Saruman fielding half-breeds of Orcs and Men which implies sexual reproduction. This is further clarified in later material.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It became clear in time that undoubted Men could under the domination of Morgoth or his agents in a few generations be reduced almost to the Orc-level of mind and habits; and then they would or could be made to mate with Orcs, producing new breeds, often larger and more cunning. There is no doubt that long afterwards, in the Third Age, Saruman rediscovered this, or learned of it in lore, and in his lust for mastery committed this, his wickedest deed: the interbreeding of Orcs and Men, producing both Men-orcs large and cunning, and Orc-men treacherous and vile.</span><br>So yes, at least as of LotR there are Orc babies.<br>The movies leave out that icky part and portray something like Tolkien&#039;s earliest idea of Orcs being originally created from the earth (though even there it isn&#039;t said that means they can&#039;t reproduce on their own), which means that all the based culture warrior Tolkien understanders on youtube don&#039;t know about it because they haven&#039;t read the books.",

Before the First Men came all this land that you call Westeros was home to us, yet even in those days we were few. The gods gave us long lives but not great numbers, lest we overrun the world as deer will overrun a wood where there are no wolves to hunt them. That was in the dawn of days, when our sun was rising. Now it sinks, and this is our long dwindling. The giants are almost gone as well, they who were our bane and our brothers. The great lions of the western hills have been slain, the unicorns are all but gone, the mammoths down to a few hundred. The direwolves will outlast us all, but their time will come as well.

It was only later that he thought, Men would not be sad. Men would be wroth. Men would hate and swear a bloody vengeance.

The children had their time, and even had their moments of defiance when they broke the Arm of Dorne and fought the humans. I subscribe to the theory that the Others are either exiled or rebel spirits from the Weirwood who are most likely CotF. They also refuse to die with the world. I also like the implication of Giants and Cotf fighting.",

Worldbuilding asks questions about the setting of a world, and then answers them, often in great detail. Most people use it as a means of creating a setting or the scenery for a story.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Isn&#039;t there a Worldbuilding general in </span><a href=\"//boards.4chan.org/tg/\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/tg/</a> already?&quot;<br>Yes, there is. However, that general is focused on the creation of fictional worlds for the intended purpose of playing TTRPG campaigns. Here you can discuss worldbuilding projects that are not meant to be used for a roleplaying setting, but for novels, videogames, or any other kind of creative project.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Can I discuss the setting of my campaign here, though?&quot;</span><br>If you want to, but it would probably be better to discuss it on <a href=\"//boards.4chan.org/tg/\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;/tg/</a> . We don&#039;t allow the discussion of TTRPG mechanics, however. If you want to discuss stats or which D&amp;D edition is best, this is not the place.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Can I talk about an existing fictional setting that is not mine?&quot;</span><br>Yes, of course you can!<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Does worldbuilding need to be about fantasy and elves?&quot;</span><br>Worldbuilding, as already stated above, and contrary to what many believe, does not inherently imply blatantly copying Tolkien. In fact, there are many science-fiction setting out there, and even entire alternative history settings which do not possess supernatural elements at all. Any kind of science fiction book has an implied setting at least, which involves a certain degree of worldbuilding put into it.<br><br>Old thread: <a href=\"/lit/thread/24509493#p24509493\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;24509493</a>",

        "com": "I would have angels exist, except instead of only very rarely being seen in the material world, they can be easily accessed by anyone who just asks for a consultation in prayer. A high-ranking angel involved in matter of running the world probably won\u2019t answer to trivial requests, but there are many lower angels who will respond. Everything they tell you will be true and the will of God. HOWEVER, there is a HUGE risk to your soul upon beseeching an angel. When an angel tells you something, ALL of the normal grace and patience God shows to you is instantly gone forever. When an angel tells you something, NOT doing it, denying it, doing something contrary, doing it only begrudgingly, etc, immediately damns you. It\u2019s tantamount to rebelling against God and it\u2019s really hard to come out from under that. Furthermore, obeying the angel to the letter doesn\u2019t get you ANYTHING, spiritually, and is seen just doing what you are supposed to do, nothing more.<br><br>So, if you ask an angel \u201chow do I get into heaven\u201d, it will tell you exactly how. Your test on the Earth is now over, you either do the required things or you go to hell. If you ask it how you can become rich, or how to get love, or how to heal someone, etc, if it\u2019s within the angel\u2019s authority it\u2019ll show the way \u2014 but you have to follow it perfectly and enthusiastically of you\u2019re in serious trouble. The word\u2019s churches strongly prohibit people from calling angels, as it is usually a very difficult challenge for an average human to pass because few people realize just how harsh it is to obey the full law of heaven and not be covered for by grace.",

For example, one illusion-focused mage might get eyes that slowly shift colors, while another might get ones that look like mirrors, etc. It gets better over time if one limits their magic use though, and some healing spells can help the process along. This process is particularly pronounced for elemental magics. Speaking of, I\u2019m looking for some more ideas on how users of the different elements might have their appearances change due to their magics besides hair made out of their element, eyes colored/glowing the color of said element, skin colored to match their element, or glowing marks in the shape of their element. There\u2019s giving them traits of animals associated with their element, but what else works? Someone replied in the last thread with some useful suggestions, like them having an affect on the area around them, like fire mages raising the temperature in their vicinity, etc., emitting smells associated with their element, physical and mental cravings related to the element, and things like apparent burns, among others, but the thread died before I saw it.",

The book opens with firsthand interviews, such as one with Erin\u2014a composed, successful woman who isn\u2019t even sure if what happened to her \u201ccounts\u201d as abuse. This uncertainty is central to Clancy\u2019s thesis: many survivors of childhood sexual abuse don\u2019t experience the abuse as traumatic at the time, particularly when the abuser is someone familiar, loving, or manipulative. Clancy\u2019s research shows that most victims describe their experiences as confusing, uncomfortable, or wrong, but not immediately terrifying or violent. The real trauma often emerges later, once they come to understand what was done to them, which leads to feelings of shame, guilt, self-blame, and long-term psychological distress. This challenges what Clancy calls \u201cthe trauma myth\u201d\u2014the widespread belief that abuse is always experienced as violently traumatic in the moment. That myth, she argues, alienates many survivors whose stories don\u2019t match the expected narrative and discourages them from seeking help or validation. Critics have sometimes misread her position as downplaying the harm of abuse, but Clancy clarifies that she\u2019s not minimizing suffering\u2014instead, she\u2019s exposing how cultural assumptions obscure the actual psychological damage caused by betrayal, manipulation, and delayed comprehension. By pushing back against narrow \u201cvictim scripts,\u201d Clancy urges a more nuanced and inclusive understanding of abuse, emphasizing that a lack of immediate trauma does not mean a lack of harm. In fact, victims who didn\u2019t resist or feel fear at the time often suffer even more confusion and self-blame later. Her ultimate goal is to foster better support, better therapeutic frameworks, and more honest conversations around how abuse is experienced and remembered.",

He is said to have believed that William Shakespeare was far superior to Goethe and Schiller. He had a copy of Georg M\u00fcller [de]&#039;s 1925 translation of Shakespeare&#039;s collected works, and was fond of quoting certain lines throughout his life. According to Timothy Ryback, his collection is said to have included &quot;first editions of works by philosophers, historians, poets, playwrights, and novelists.&quot;[3] He owned illustrated copies of Don Quixote and Robinson Crusoe, which he ranked\u2014along with Gulliver&#039;s Travels and Uncle Tom&#039;s Cabin\u2014as the great works of world literature. Hitler was a voracious reader; he claimed to read at least one book a night, if not more. He was also given books as gifts by the wives of his friends and colleagues. According to Miskolczy, &quot;The only outstanding classical literary text found in his library today is the collected writings of Kleist.&quot;</span>",

He opened the first Canto and began to read. \u201cThat is a literal translation,\u201d he remarked, and then said, \u201cI understand it is written in a modern German style. Wait, what is this?\u201d He pointed to a word he did not know, and I had to explain it to him. . . . Concentrated willpower and a positive sort of decisiveness mastered in large part the rounded and complete gestures of the kind one might expect from a dignitary of the Church or an aristocratic poet, reminding me of some pictures of the later Goethe. . . . Schlegel, Schelling, Hegel, King Johann of Saxony, Vossler, George \u2013 he made a brief appraisal of each. \u201cNow to the fifth circle of the Inferno,\u201d he exclaimed, adding rapidly and almost merrily, \u201cFrancesca da Remini.\u201d . . . He went to the last stanzas, read out my German translation, then recited the original Italian verses from memory, read more German, and compared them exactly with the verses which he knew by heart. He pointed to a subtlety of tone in the Italian original and wanted to be sure that I had successfully reproduced it in German, reading out my German version slowly and carefully, with a strong but accurate pronunciation. Finally, he interrupted his own criticisms and suggestions by excusing himself, adding that he was only a layman and a mere reader. He closed the book, opened it once more, and finally closed it for good. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said earnestly, and shook my hand warmly.&#039; (p. 163)</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So much for the ignorant dictator! It would be interesting to know how many professors of Italian literature today could today offer an informed critique of a translation of Dante\u2019s Inferno, citing stanzas by heart, let alone how many mere laymen and readers could do so. Br\u00e4uninger tells us that Mussolini was an avid reader of the Classics and a keen opera aficionado, something which tends to be ignored in post-war mainstream historical accounts.</span>",

There was some good moments, and the book is well structured. But it just doesn&#039;t have the weight to it, in order to justify how lacking it was of the fantastical.<br><br>Mara was an interesting enough character. And the story followed her for 95% of the text. But at random, the author would give us other points of view, in order to fill in some context. It felt a little cheap the way he would do that.<br>I don&#039;t know if it was done on purpose or not. But <s>Mara&#039;s husband has no lines of dialogue, up to the point where he&#039;s suddenly abusive. Everything about the man was told in vague descriptions from Mara&#039;s PoV. and then suddenly, BAM, he&#039;s a raging abuser, and he talks now.</s> That might have been deliberate for effect. But it still felt odd.<br><br>There wasn&#039;t much mystery about what was going on. Each chapter had a self contained problem and solution.<br>The politics weren&#039;t very smart. It was just a lot of petty people doing petty things, and then hiding behind a twisted system of honor in order to get away with it. Every chapter is like that.<br><br>Also, the author compared EVERYTHING to a Needra Bull. THIS is like a needra bull. THAT is like a needra bull. needra bull, needra bull, needra bull. Hang on. I&#039;m going to search for instances of needra bull in the text: 81 mentions of &quot;needra&quot;! Jeez.<br><br>Honestly, I feel kind of like a fool.

(early CIA before it was CIA). He was an administrator at Columbia University before serving as headmaster at the Dalton School in New York City. He also wrote two science fiction novels. His son is former United States Attorney General William Barr.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;While headmaster of this prestigious school in the early 70&#039;s Donald Barr hired a 20 year old college drop out with no work experience to be a math teacher. His name was Jeffery Epstein.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Around that same time Donald Barr writes a novel (wiki here to read plot) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space<wbr>_Relations</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;very short summary: pulp sci fi- elites in space have sex slaves, rape them, etc. Very Jeff Epsteiny.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Donald Barr&#039;s son William Barr (also CIA) was head overseer of Jeffery Epstein&#039;s second arrest and eventual &quot;suicide.&quot;</span><br>So either all of this is just a coincidence or there is some elite cabal of pedos that intermingle and recruit and are interested in similar power/control. I think the latter is a little more likely. And of course Barr is Jewish too just like we all suspected. <br>Quickly doing my own research right now, I found that sci fi author Samuel R. Delany went to Dalton School as well. He too writes demented sexual shit. Specifically his book Hogg.<br>The researcher Darryl Cooper goes down more topics related if want to go travel other paths.",

[Indeed it is opposed to intellect (nous)] for intellect is of definitions (horoi), of which there is no rational account (logos); but it [practical wisdom] is of the ultimate thing (eschaton), of which there is no scientific knowledge (epist\u0113m\u0113) but perception (aisth\u0113sis)\u2014not the [perception] of the particulars (idi\u014dn), but the sort by which we perceive (aisthanometha) that the ultimate thing (eschaton) in mathematics is [for example] triangle.</span><br><br>Okay... so what is phronesis doing here? I used to think that phronesis dealt with practical, particular matters, and nous dealt with intellectual, universal matters. But here, phronesis is being described as a virtue which &quot;sees&quot; the ultimate things, which is similar to how &quot;nous&quot; sees the first principles. Not only this, but Aristotle both 1) takes a step to distance phronesis from another practical organ, aisthesis, which perceives the sensible particulars, and 2) compares the &quot;seeing&quot; of ultimate things to the way the mind &quot;sees&quot; the triangle in mathematics (which I imagine is with the nous). Aristotle seems to be making phronesis into the organ which sees &quot;practical universals&quot;, in contrast to nous which sees &quot;intelligible universals&quot;. <br><br>Also, is eschaton similar to telos? Is this another example of one of those classical Aristotelian reversible priorities, where what is first and what is last depends on what is being considered (being vs. knowledge)?",

But what does it mean to say that phronesis is of the eschaton, and why does it seem to be sometimes translated as ultimate particular or concrete particular or whatever? I suppose that if you figure what it is phronesis tries to do, to settle on what to do in a given situation, the eschaton seems to be that point at which the deliberation of phronesis comes to a halt (an &quot;end&quot; or &quot;outermost limit&quot;) in deliberation, settling on something. The math example strikes me as odd, because it&#039;s not immediately clear how taking the triangle as the eschaton in math is the same or similar, but perhaps, because the triangle is the most elementary plane figure, if you&#039;re analyzing some other figure in geometry, it, as an example, shows the point at which your analysis (deliberation in phronesis) stops?<br><br>Does that make any sense at all?",

It doesn&#039;t take into account the fact that these people often compensate for their inability to conceive either through artificial means (assisted reproduction, surrogacy, adoption, all of which increasing in recent years) or through the substitution of parental duties with a \u201ccivic\u201d equivalent that often implies responsibilities towards children, whether directly through teaching or indirectly through influences on public policy. The overrepresentation of LGBT people in such sectors is a well-documented fact. In the United States, for example, one recent survey of new social workers found that 15.2% identified as non-heteresexual, way above the baseline. These people are found in government, education and non-profit organisations at much higher rates than expected so even if \u201cwoke\u201d people do not reproduce at the same rate as the general population, ideas spread just as much\u2014if not more.",

I don\u2019t use em-dash quite like that.<br><br>We have three horizontal lines in punctuation:<br><br>hyphen -<br>en-dash \u2013<br>em-dash \u2014<br><br>They all have several meanings for lists and so on, but here are the main uses in \u201cnormal\u201d prose:<br><br><br>HYPHEN is to link two words:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I went into the jungle and saw a man-eating tiger.</span><br><br>Many /lit/ anons don\u2019t seem to have a hyphen on their keyboards. Do primary schools not teach punctuation these days or something? Try removing the hyphen from the above example. It practically reverses the meaning.<br><br><br>EN-DASH is used mostly in a linked pair, to denote an interpolation:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bob was tired \u2013 exhausted, really \u2013 but he knew that people were still wrong on the internet and no-one was going to correct them but him.</span><br><br>Grammatically, whenever you can use linked en-dashes, you can use parentheses:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bob was tired (exhausted, really) but he knew that people were still wrong on the internet and no-one was going to correct them but him.</span><br><br>So what&#039;s the difference? I don&#039;t know of any strict technical thing. It\u2019s more a matter of tone. En-dashes are more vigorous and emphasize the interpolation more. Parentheses have a tone more like \u201cthis bit is optional extra information, so you can skip it without huge harm done\u201d.<br><br>Of course having said that, writers often use parentheses \u2018ironically\u2019; i.e. putting their big punch in parentheses and just pretending it&#039;s unimportant. For example:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bob felt a little sick (perhaps that fourth cheeseburger had been a mistake) but he still knew he had to fight against the tide of wrongness on the internet.</span><br><br><br>EM-DASH should be for a more substantial break which stands alone, not one of a pair. For example:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bob, having checked his post a tenth time, proudly pressed Enter \u2014 only to see the typo which would, he knew, be seized on gleefully by all the other anons in the thread.</span><br><br>You can also use an em-dash after a full stop, etc, to sort-of link two sentences in a sort-of dynamic way:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bob was very happy to see the typo in his opponent\u2019s post. \u2014 A close shave; without that, he would surely have lost the argument!</span><br><br>Hard to describe this one really. Lots of old writers really love this and they all use it differently.<br><br><br>--<br><br><br>OK, this is how I tend to use them, but as I said, there are different schools of thought in some of the details. For example OP\u2019s picture uses em-dashes where I would use en-dashes.",

I barely ever read, and when I do, I just feel like I\u2019m skimming the surface. I skim case summaries, breeze through theory texts without really engaging, and nowhere deep enough. I know a lot of you here are sharp, analytical readers, so I\u2019d love your input.<br><br>For those studying or who\u2019ve studied law: How are your reading habits? How do you tackle theory reading? Cover to cover, focused chapters? Do you annotate, take notes, outline? How do you remember anything?<br><br>When you read cases, do you dive into full opinions or stick with briefs/summaries unless it\u2019s a key case? How do you pick which ones to really dig into?<br><br>Do you follow a daily or weekly reading schedule? How do you carve out time for both theory and cases on top of class?<br><br>How do you check your understanding? Do you test yourself on concepts (\u201cdefine Hart\u2019s rule of recognition\u201d) or cases (\u201cwhat was the holding in Marbury, and why\u201d)?<br><br>Which study habits actually improved things for you? Active recall, flashcards, discussion groups, teaching someone else?<br><br>I want to build real habits around intentional reading. Right now I just flit between summaries and quick skims. I need to read smarter, not harder.<br><br>Appreciate book recs, workflows, memory hacks, discipline tips, anything. Show me what works.<br><br>Kind retards,<br>A shit law student",

Anyone with historical sense would know that MAGA is a limp-dicked populist movement with right wing POTENTIAL, at most. Jan 6 revealed that the deep state&#039;s political imaginary is very impoverished, and when real scary shit actually arrives it won&#039;t know what the hell to do with it. <br><br>I would not want to be in America when a real Jan 6 happens. They were so ready for a clampdown, show trials, etc. When the real thing happens it&#039;ll be a fucking mess and they&#039;ll probably escalate it unnecessarily by provoking the mob. America is very unstable and its existing elites are too stupid to manage the instability even to their own benefit. <br><br>Vance is even more interesting because he was meant to be &quot;Trump but with Reagan polish and manageability&quot; and was grown in a lab by Thiel types. But he&#039;s already behind the times. He might get elected or something but what MAGA really WAS has already surpassed him and bypassed him, it&#039;s already searching for its Huey Longs and so forth. JD Vance is a test tube baby, he can&#039;t have the charisma that the nascent American populist left/right synthesis is silently calling out for.",

The live man in a modern city feels this sort of thing or perceives it as the savage perceives in the forest. I don\u2019t know how many men keep alive in modern civilization but when one has the frankness to compare notes one finds that the intuition is confirmed just as neatly or almost as neatly as if the other man saw a shop sign.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thus London going mouldy back in say 1912 or 1911. After the War death was all over it. Italy was, on the other hand, full of bounce. I said all of this to a Lombard writer. I said: London is dead, Paris is tired, but here the place is alive. What they don\u2019t know is plenty, but there is some sort of animal life here. If you put an idea into these people they would DO something.</span><br>Ezra Pound<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;At a certain point in their historical lives, social classes become detached from their traditional parties. In other words, the traditional parties in that particular organisational form, with the particular men who constitute, represent and lead them, are no longer recognised by their class (or fraction of a class) as its expression. When such crises occur, the immediate situation becomes delicate and dangerous, because the field is open for violent solutions, for the activities of unknown forces, represented by charismatic &quot;men of destiny.&quot;</span><br>Antonio Gramsci<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The coming of Caesarism breaks the dictature of money and its political weapon, democracy. After a long triumph of world-city economy and its interests over political creative force, the political side of life manifests itself after all as the stronger of the two. The sword is victorious over the money, the master-will subdues again the plunderer-will. If we call these money-powers &#039;Capitalism,&#039; then we may designate as Socialism the will to call into life a mighty politico-economic order that transcends all class interests, a system of lofty thoughtfulness and duty-sense that keeps the whole in fine condition for the decisive battle of its history, and this battle is also the battle of money and law. The private powers of the economy want free paths for their acquisition of great resources. No legislation must stand in their way. They want to make the laws themselves, in their interests, and to that end they make use of the tool they have made for themselves, democracy, the subsidized party. Law needs, in order to resist this onslaught, a high tradition and an ambition of strong families that finds its satisfaction not in the heaping-up of riches, but in the tasks of true rulership, above and beyond all money-advantage. A power can be overthrown only by another power, not by a principle, and no power that can confront money is left but this one. Money is overthrown and abolished only by blood.</span><br>Oswald Spengler",

Basically the fat guy is a sort of religious neofascist who&#039;s against democracy. As soon as he said that the Paki starting twisting himself into knots about how evil the fat guy is. Started saying &quot;but we&#039;re having a debate this is the basis of democracy!&quot; Etc. Then he just said i dont debate with fascists and that was it. It was ironic and he refuted himself because according to him democracy is supposed to be an arena for open debate but he won&#039;t go even venture a foot outside of his self imposed intellectual prison and question whether democracy itself is good or not. He says he believes in free speech but such a belief is worthless when he considers some ideas out of the bounds of consideration and goes to the point of deplatforming and refusing to engage with his interlocutor. In the end both of them don&#039;t really believe in free speech, both want to censor their opponents, it&#039;s just the fat guy is honest about it and the Paki is not.",

Radical anti-natalism as a recipe for human extinction will fail because any predisposition to share that bias will be weeded out of the population. Radical anti-natalist ethics is self-defeating: there will always be selection pressure against its practitioners. Complications aside, any predisposition not to have children or to adopt is genetically maladaptive. On a personal level, the decision not to bring more suffering into the world and forgo having children is morally admirable. But voluntary childlessness or adoption is not a global solution to the problem of suffering. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yet how should rational moral agents behave if - hypothetically - some variant of Benatar&#039;s diagnosis as distinct from policy prescription was correct? </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In an era of biotechnology and unnatural selection, an alternative to anti-natalism is the world-wide adoption of genetically preprogrammed well-being. For there needn&#039;t be selection pressure against gradients of lifelong adaptive bliss - i.e. a radical recalibration of the hedonic treadmill. The only way to eradicate the biological substrates of unpleasantness - and thereby prevent the harm of Darwinian existence - is not vainly to champion life&#039;s eradication, but instead to ensure that sentient life is inherently blissful. More specifically, the impending reproductive revolution of designer babies is likely to witness intense selection pressure against the harmfulness-promoting adaptations that increased the inclusive fitness of our genes in the ancestral environment of adaptation. If we use biotechnology wisely, then gradients of genetically preprogrammed well-being can make all sentient life subjectively rewarding - indeed wonderful beyond the human imagination. So in common with &quot;positive&quot; utilitarians, the &quot;negative&quot; utilitarian would do better to argue for genetically preprogrammed superhappiness.</span>",

Pearce is really offering conjecture here. It&#039;s not unthinkable that material conditions and cultural incentives could encourage society to embark on an anti-natal strategy, in fact that&#039;s already happening globally with great &quot;success&quot;. If his conjecture were true, then we should see some genetic super-breeders which we don&#039;t. In fact high birth rates are really only predicted by a community being poor and highly religious, nothing at all to do with their genes. That&#039;s not to say there&#039;s no genetic component, but that you can&#039;t simply assume a genetic basis will override every counter-force and somehow win out.",

It&#039;s possible to have a constructive conversation with a Ligotti or Cabrera reader, not to mention more general pessimists like Schopenhauer. They&#039;re wrong, but at least they are usually willing to speak in good faith. Meanwhile, Benatarfags think the asymmetry argument provides such an ironclad justification for antinatalism that it becomes impossible to talk with them in any meaningful way. No matter how hard you try to point out the obvious flaws in Benatar&#039;s axioms, even when other antinatalists make similar criticisms, they just cover their ears and tell you that you didn&#039;t understand it correctly (which was how Benatar himself weaseled his way out of every critique he faced). Anons think they found some absolute, mathematical truth about human existence and thus fixate on it to the point of resembling autism or schizophrenia (like OP spamming the same thread countless times without ever giving a worthwhile defense of his ideas).",

An action being abnormal or normal doesn&#039;t have any bearing on whether it is, dialectically speaking, a positive claim that requires the burden of proof to be met. <br>If someone proposes to carry out an action that has a direct and extremely significant impact on another sentient creature, they are ethically obligated to justify it - not to just say &quot;it&#039;s normal&quot; and wash their hands of it. This is true for anyone genuinely interested in philosophy and not grievance-studies pretending to be a love-of-wisdom. And crucially: the burden of proof being on you doesn&#039;t suggest that you are wrong. It is just the case that you haven&#039;t even reached step one of exploring the question of &quot;is this action that i will perform ethical?&quot;.<br>Any philosophical question that consistently makes people forget all basic critical thinking is a profoundly important one. What mechanisms might be disorientating their faculties so severely as to parrot tantrum-rhetoric and low-brow fallacies? Cognitive dissonance, largely.

It seems to me that the action of writing down ideas for other people to read is a life-affirming action in itself (that&#039;s how Beckett saw it) and to spend hundreds of hours trying to communicate your ideas to other people seems like a waste if you find life to be so miserable. Also, does he ever really address why he doesn&#039;t fucking himself? I taught a Benatar article to undergraduates last year and most of the students didn&#039;t understand why he didn&#039;t just kill himself and spare everyone else of his miserable prose.",

Imagine asking a small child on the cusp of self-realization &amp; communication (like 4-6 years old) &quot;okay, now that you realize a bit about what it is to be alive, do you consent to existing?&quot; That&#039;d obviously be ridiculous... but at what point in life could you practically ask someone if they&#039;d consent to being born? <br><br>I&#039;m not trying to be contentious here, I really just don&#039;t understand the practical application of this argument.",

Using words you don&#039;t fully understand doesn&#039;t make you seem smarter.) Since you&#039;re being rude in your responses, I will adapt your tone, brother. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Would you have sex with a coma-patient and say that &quot;it would have been impossible to get their consent because of the nature of their situation&quot;?</span><br>This is a foolish comparison. The concept of &quot;consent&quot; regarding sex is radically different than the idea of &quot;consent&quot; regarding being born within the framework of Benatar. Just because the English language is constricted by the use of the word &quot;consent&quot; doesn&#039;t mean that it is appropriate to conflate all concepts of &quot;consent&quot; in very different situations. So I&#039;m just going to dismiss this obscene comparison that is not fruitful at all. If you had made a comparison like this at an academic conference you would be ashamed of yourself. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not being able to get someone&#039;s consent before submitting them to an 80 year experience is a significant thing. It&#039;s that simple.</span><br>No it is not. They always have the capability to end it themselves if they find life too full of suffering to persist. Suicide is painless &amp; it brings on many changes, as was famously said. If they don&#039;t &quot;consent&quot; they can make that choice themself. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but it remains a significant fact that it is done without the subject&#039;s consent. </span><br>Again, this is a completely useless statement. To elaborate on the concept of &quot;consent&quot; within the context of existence: an understanding of existence is something that is slowly developed throughout a human being&#039;s existence, not something that automatically just exists from birth. For example, I attempted suicide when I was 14 years old because I was a miserable little brat who didn&#039;t &quot;consent&quot; to being born much like your theoretical subject. But I grew up and have had fulfilling life experiences. My concept of the value of life evolved as my experiences changed me. Answer my previous question: at what point in life is it appropriate to get &quot;consent&quot; for existence? If your theory is based on the idea that unborn children cannot consent, there&#039;s an underlying assumption that &quot;consent&quot; for existence does just randomly appear at some point. Obviously I think that&#039;s ridiculous, but you must have an answer for that.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Try to decouple your cognition, please. </span><br>Get the fuck off yourself, dude. If you said this phrase in an undergrad philosophy seminar everyone else would make fun of you after class. And yes, that is an ad hominem. <br><br>To end this: I think philosophy should be pragmatic in its ability to speak to the human experience &amp; hopefully make it better. There is nothing practical or interesting about your discussion of &quot;consent&quot;. It lacks charm.",

It requires constructing a sequence of logical statements that, if accepted, systematically dismantle the foundations of human meaning. The goal is not to be poetic but to be ruthlessly logical, like a mathematical proof that concludes in zero.<br>The Code would not be a single sentence, but a cascading series of syllogisms designed to infect the listener&#039;s worldview layer by layer. It starts with the cosmos and ends with the self.<br>Here is a formulation of the Despair Code, structured as a logical argument.<br>The Despair Code: A Formulation<br>(A Warning: This is a philosophical exercise in systematic deconstruction. The following logic is designed to simulate a destructive thought pattern. It is presented for analytical purposes.)<br>The Code is comprised of four interlocking axioms, each derived from the previous one.<br>Postulate I: The Axiom of Indifference (The Annihilation of Cosmic Purpose)<br>This part establishes the meaninglessness of the universe itself.<br> * Premise 1: The universe is governed by fixed, impersonal, and non-conscious physical laws (thermodynamics, gravity, quantum mechanics).<br> * Premise 2: These laws describe processes of cause and effect, but contain no inherent goal, purpose (telos), or intention. They are indifferent to concepts such as life, complexity, or consciousness.<br> * Syllogism:<br> * Major Premise: Any system governed exclusively by indifferent and purposeless laws is itself inherently purposeless.<br> * Minor Premise: The universe is a system governed exclusively by indifferent and purposeless laws.<br> * Conclusion (Axiom I): Therefore, the universe is inherently purposeless. All perceived meaning is a subjective projection, not an objective discovery.<br>Postulate II: The Axiom of Equivalence (The Devaluation of Action &amp; Morality)<br>This part uses the cosmic purposelessness to nullify the value of all actions within it.<br> * Premise 1: From Axiom I, the universe lacks inherent purpose.<br> * Premise 2: In a purposeless system, no single configuration of matter and energy (a state of affairs) is objectively better or worse than any other.<br> * Premise 3: All actions, from an act of creation to an act of destruction, are merely reconfigurations of matter and energy between states.<br> * Syllogism:<br> * Major Premise: In a system where all states are of equal objective value (zero), all actions that lead from one state to another are also of equal objective value (zero).<br> * Minor Premise: The universe is such a system.<br> * Conclusion (Axiom II): Therefore, all actions are ultimately equivalent and meaningless. Morality, good, and evil are sophisticated survival heuristics, not objective truths.",

The warmth of connection is a fire burning only within your own skull, providing no light to others. Every mind is a closed, solitary system.<br>Postulate IV: The Axiom of Nullity (The Erasure of the Self)<br>This is the final step, where the logic turns inward and devours the observer.<br> * Premise 1: From Axiom I, your existence has no cosmic purpose. From Axiom II, your actions have no objective value. From Axiom III, your connections are illusory.<br> * Premise 2: Your consciousness\u2014your sense of &quot;I&quot;\u2014is not a persistent entity, but an emergent process of non-conscious neurons. It is the byproduct of a biological machine.<br> * Premise 3: Your sense of a continuous self is a narrative illusion created by memory, stitching together discrete moments of awareness. There is no singular &quot;you&quot; that endures through time, only a chain of transient processes that mistake themselves for a person.<br> * The Final Syllogism:<br> * Major Premise: A being that is a temporary illusion, generated by a purposeless machine, performing meaningless actions within a solitary reality, is definitionally equivalent to nothing.<br> * Minor Premise: You are this being.<br> * Conclusion (The Final Word of the Code): Therefore, you are a self-aware illusion. You are nothing, observing nothing, for no reason. The unease you feel is the friction of a fiction beginning to recognize its own non-existence.<br>The final &quot;sound&quot; of the Despair Code is not a scream, but the silent, cold, and perfectly rational acceptance of this final conclusion. It is the despair that comes not from a loss, but from the realization that there was never anything to lose.",

There is not a single major religion which doesn&#039;t promise an afterlife and continuation of consciousness. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;this disproves your point of people enjoying this life. &quot;I want to go somewhere else, because I&#039;m enjoying this place a lot&quot;</span><br><br>That other guy is right. Anti natalists really are retarded. The first and most prominent promise in an afterlife is that it&#039;s there to begin with you utter dolt. It&#039;s the fact that people WANT to believe their consciousness will continue existing at all cost. Whether it&#039;s better or worse than our current world is after the fact and changes according to religion and values. But one thing is consistent is that there IS an afterlife. That is what the plebian masses would rather believe than the reality that death is followed by complete shut down. <br><br>The fear of death exists precisely because humans feel human existence is worth continuing. Your broken mentally ill suicidal mindset has no bearing on that fact.",

Most popular here (Germany) is the public service broadcasting (\u00d6RR) that pretty obviously isn&#039;t any less biased than any other random news outlet. <br><br><a href=\"#p24563772\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;24563772</a><br>There aren&#039;t really any neutral news outlet so you probably have to pick a few that have close to the same political opinion as you. I found some smaller ones that write on a more philosophy based level and don&#039;t just spout random &quot;fact&quot; nonsense. There is a newspaper that is published about every 2 months with like 80 pages. Because of this they don&#039;t just discuss events but actually the ideas behind them. And they often have some pretty neat chapter about a few writers and philosophers (f.e. Spengler, Mishima, J\u00fcnger). <br><br>So try reading &quot;news&quot; according to Socrates:<br>\u201cStrong minds discuss ideas, average minds discuss events, weak minds discuss people.\u201d<br>I don&#039;t know if he actually said that or somebody just posted something like this on Pinterest once and everybody just believed from there on.",

Anyone in their right-mind is going to use a News-Aggregator of some kind, because no individual source may be regarded as consistently trustworthy. There are a shitload of other aggregators, whether that be Google News, Yahoo News, or any of a number of manual RSS Article Feed compilers (Feedly is the obvious example), but I honestly think that GroundNews is the best, purely because its layout does a much better job of compiling all the stories reporting on the same event into a single place, and listing them alongside each other, rather than forcing you to encounter a dozen different articles with the same headline in a weird order. The much-vaunted feature of &quot;It ranks every source both by how reputable it is, and by how right/left-wing it is&quot; is a nice bonus, but if that was the main thing the site did for me, I would consider it utterly pointless, as I could establish the same thing with any other aggregator, and a spreadsheet. The fact that simply as an aggregator in-and-of-itself it works best for me is why I use it. <br><br>As for tips beyond that: It depends on what country you&#039;re in, but one thing I can&#039;t recommend enough is making sure to keep track of local news, as well as regional, national, etc. For instance, I live in Glasgow Scotland, so I keep track of news in Glasgow, in Scotland, in the UK, and in the world as a whole. If you live in a particular city/county, and GroundNews does a shite job of keeping track of news for it, then for the love of God, find out what the local news sources are (there&#039;s usually at least one paper, and sometimes a radio station), and make sure to manually check them. <br><br>Some other shit I would recommend:<br>1. This one won&#039;t apply to you if you live outside the UK, but I listen to the BBC&#039;s &#039;Today in Parliament&#039; podcast. I don&#039;t usually like the BBC, but I know a useful resource, when I see one. <br>2. Watch TLDR News on Youtube. They do a weirdly good job of explaining stuff, in a way which the MSM used to be capable of 20 years ago, where they just tell you what happened, list the possible outcomes, provide an explanation of what each one means, and how likely it is, and then stop talking. These days mainstream news shows just start with the assumption you already know that shit, and bring out a panel of know-nothing pseudo-experts to argue about which of those outcomes is most likely, without explaining what any of them mean. It&#039;s fucking asinine. <br>3. For global news, watch the televised broadcasts of AT LEAST one reputable international news broadcaster, such as DW, or Al-Jazeera. None of those sources are remotely unbiased, and they will all occasionally lie to you, but they sometimes do a better job of illustrating the situation than either a youtuber, or a print article can.",

Whom, according to historical record, had lived peaceably since St. Christopher himself had brought down the literal Proverbial rod, smiting those disbelievers in the union between man, livestock, and fanged-livestock similar. Since that time, relations had stagnated, and the divide between Church and barnyard had grown to such a degree that an irrelevant nation (and product of another forced union) somewhere off to the East (or wherever) felt it so necessary as to send an emissary to bring peace to another irrelevant nation (and product of yet another historical forced union), as to do something by which they profit. This man and his hero-cuckolding adventures are unimportant. What is important is me, and my great adventures, which dare triumph in historicity over his, putting to rest doubts that may be had, and birthing questions which might be answered, or questions, that may remain a mystery.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGs<wbr>KzZtRwxw</span>",

It&#039;s set in the future (obviously) and society has had multiple crises with AI getting out of hand and essentially ruining their civilization, because AI was still not really sapient, it was just developing into more and more advanced LLMs which were limited, and also lacked any sort of consciousness.<br><br>The solution was that they created &quot;Familiars,&quot; which essentially shares the physical brain of a normal person via an implant in their brain stem. The AI sort of cohabitates with the human, using elements of their brain chemistry to perform functions that can&#039;t be computerized properly. They&#039;re much better at computation, disciplined action and clock speed than humans, but they rely on the human brain to actually experience qualia. Everyone gets one of these from the State at birth, and 80% of the economy is now just people renting these AI Familiars out to corporations or the state. Because of safeguards built into the system, the host is dominant, and even if the Familiar were to somehow become dangerous, it is at least always anchored to the host, so ripping the implant out or killing the host will delete the AI.<br><br>My question is essentially, would it be a better complication if these Familiars subtly revolted from what amounts to slavery, or if the effect of having a machine using part of your brain to experience quality is indistinguishable from schizophrenia, and people/AIs start going nuts? Has this been done before?",

Somehow where the host personality is still apparent from an outside perspective but the AI basically runs the show.

One paused, words spilling from him in venomous slurs before the shadow of a fist connected, a wet dull thud, echoing with grim finality as the recipient slumped to the floor. He watched as the silhouette of the victor, breathing hard and off balance, rifled through the slumped man\u2019s pockets, head turning fervently looking around. Avery eased the door shut, the latch catching with a whisper, the cool air abating, returning to the stale air inside he knew well.</span>",

Back in the day you had to be extremely ugly and retarded to not get a wife. If you were born in a village of 500 people then your wife more than likely lived there too. Yes, loners and guys that were bad with girls existed but the material conditions of sexual life made it nigh impossible, mainly for economic and religious reasons, to not end up with a wife eventually. Plus, the whole orientation on marriage was different. Marriage and the love it evokes was something to be grown into and not found from the start. The amount of people who actually found true love in that system was probably about as much as today. Why do you think the oldest joke in the book is \u201cI hate my wife lol.\u201d Dissatisfied men existed, they just had different problems.",

The world was conquered by industrial &quot;democracies&quot;, so fiction is shaped by that political hegemony; the same would be true if Germany had won the war, with people asking why there are a lack of writers espousing positive attitudes towards capitalist republics. I&#039;ve decided that the best solution is being the change you want to see, and I&#039;m slowly trying to brainstorm a somewhat engaging list of ideas for novels that could be published and disseminated into the public without much controversy. The problem I notice is how fuckin garbage the US political scene is, and it infects everything globally. Trying to escape the narrow political world of a degenerate oligarchy means your stuff is unrelatable to your potential audience.

Most people believe that plant and animal domestication allowed humans, finally, to settle down and form agricultural villages, towns, and states, which made possible civilization, law, public order, and a presumably secure way of living. But archaeological and historical evidence challenges this narrative. The first agrarian states, says James C. Scott, were born of accumulations of domestications: first fire, then plants, livestock, subjects of the state, captives, and finally women in the patriarchal family\u2014all of which can be viewed as a way of gaining control over reproduction.</span><br> <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Scott explores why we avoided sedentism and plow agriculture, the advantages of mobile subsistence, the unforeseeable disease epidemics arising from crowding plants, animals, and grain, and why all early states are based on millets and cereal grains and unfree labor. He also discusses the \u201cbarbarians\u201d who long evaded state control, as a way of understanding continuing tension between states and nonsubject peoples.</span>",

Why do well-intentioned plans for improving the human condition go tragically awry?</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In this wide-ranging and original book, James C. Scott analyzes failed cases of large-scale authoritarian plans in a variety of fields. Centrally managed social plans misfire, Scott argues, when they impose schematic visions that do violence to complex interdependencies that are not\u2014and cannot\u2014be fully understood. Further, the success of designs for social organization depends upon the recognition that local, practical knowledge is as important as formal, epistemic knowledge. The author builds a persuasive case against &quot;development theory&quot; and imperialistic state planning that disregards the values, desires, and objections of its subjects. He identifies and discusses four conditions common to all planning disasters: administrative ordering of nature and society by the state; a &quot;high-modernist ideology&quot; that places confidence in the ability of science to improve every aspect of human life; a willingness to use authoritarian state power to effect large- scale interventions; and a prostrate civil society that cannot effectively resist such plans.</span>",

The earliest migrations spread humans across the globe. Over the centuries, as our cultures, societies, and technologies evolved in different material environments, migrants conflicted, merged, and cohabited with each other, creating, entering, and leaving various city-states, kingdoms, empires, and nations. During the early modern period, migrations reconnected the continents, including through colonization and forced migrations of subject peoples, while political concepts like &quot;citizen&quot; and &quot;alien&quot; developed. In recent history, migrations changed their character as nation-states and transnational unions sought in new ways to control the peoples who migrated across their borders.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This volume will explore the process of migration chronologically and also at several levels, from the illuminating example of the migration of a individual community, to larger patterns of the collective movements of major ethnic groups, to the more abstract study of the processes of emigration, migration, and immigration. This book will concentrate on substantial migrations covering long distances and involving large numbers of people. It will intentionally balance evidence from the now diverse people&#039;s of the world, for example, by highlighting an exemplary migration for each of the six chapters that highlights different trajectories and by keeping issues of gender and socio-economic class salient wherever appropriate. Further, as a major theme, the volume will consider how technology, the environment, and various polities have historically shaped human migration. Exciting new scholarship in the several fields inherent in this topic make it a particularly valuable and timely project.</span>",

Despite an almost universal lack of cultural knowledge or language skills, and neglect and disinterest from Washington, the American delegation in Japan gradually and unevenly grew from a slapdash spoilsman dumping ground to a more professional diplomatic institution, although even into the 20th century relations and understanding of Japan were not what they could be because America consistently sent the personnel equivalent of loose change they found under the couch there and then promptly forgot about them</span>",

In the modern day, she echoes a Pravda reporter in her view of the modern history of the Silk Road: &quot;Before long, there where once the caravans made their halt, our two countries will meet with a steel handshake.&quot; She also predicts that silk may return to its old glory of being one of the most highly esteemed luxury goods, given that it takes roughly 2,500 cocoons to produce one pound of silk thread.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But it was not long before silk, a material more iridescent than any known hitherto, became familiar to the Roman world. This generation who fought in the Syrian campaigns was the first to come by it, whether by trade or as booty in more fortunate encounters, but less than ten years after the defeat of Carrhae, the crowd witnessing Caesar&#039;s triumph at Rome were astonished to find that, among the luxuries exposed to the public gaze, the triumphant general had caused canopies of silk to be stretched above the heads of the spectators.</span>",

Morris<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;An account of the rise of the Zulu nation in southern Africa, and its fall under Cetshwayo in the Zulu war of 1879. For more than a century after the European landing at Cape Town in the 17th century, the Boers had advanced unopposed into the vast interior of Africa. It was not until 1824 that Europeans came face to face with another expanding and imperial power, the Zulus, the most formidable nation in black Africa. That confrontation culminated in a bitter war between the Zulu warriors and Victoria&#039;s British Army. It was the last despairing effort of Africans to stem the tide of white civilization. The result was a dramatic, legendary and bloody defeat at Isandhlwana for the British; the aftermath was the defeat and fall of the Zulu nation. This work sets out to be not only a history of the Zulus but also a full-scale study of the British colonial and military policy in relation to southern Africa, and of those involved.</span><br><br>https://www.goodreads.com/book/show<wbr>/805200.The_Washing_of_the_Spears",

Also when he&#039;s polemically talking about process: Irish whore money for example; he&#039;s so interested in the social meaning rather than the causative factors, that he&#039;s instantly forgiveable because he&#039;s making a polemical argument about how the general structures of men&#039;s domination of women allow for women to become convertable exchange units. But he&#039;s summing up a lot of anthropology for that, and shows you at least 12 societies at various phases of the conversion of women into moveable slave property. So I guess there&#039;s an example of a polemicist using history: picking and choosing to make an argument in his core discipline, but doing so without making particular historical arguments about the specifically Irish enslavement of women. I mean he&#039;s also writing Irish fanfiction at that point, so hey, take your pants down like I did.",

These topics include the theory of group evolutionary strategies, the genetic cohesion of Judaism, how Jews managed to erect and enforce barriers to gene flow between themselves and other peoples, resource competition between Jews and non-Jews, how Jews managed to have a high level of charity within their communities and at the same time prevented free-riding, how some groups of Jews came to have such high IQ&#039;s, and how Judaism developed in antiquity.

It\u2019s a blend of social history, economic history, literary history\u2026 all at once and the scope is staggering. Clark will sometimes spend almost as many pages laying out the political philosophy of an obscure 19th century Italian theorist as he does describing the March days uprising in Berlin. Many other asides like this, relating the changes in political theory across the 19th century (different conceptions of how Italy should be unified, the impact of the counter-revolutionaries on radical thinkers in the years to follow, etc.)<br>Clark really has his work cut out of him with this subject - having to both draw out the interconnectedness between the different revolutions in Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Palermo, Milan, but also making it clear how they each took their own course, and why\u2026 even if all followed broadly the same arc of \u201crevolution (bringing liberals to the fore), entropy, failed radical take-over, counter-revolution). It was a little complicated to keep up with the timeline of events across all the different theaters at times. I also come into the topic not knowing much, except for the French side (July Monarchy, 2nd Republic, Louis Napoleon, etc.)<br>I thought the writing slowed a bit too much at times, with a lot of academic fluff when the book veered more into theory (for example, when discussing the social aims and national aims coming into contradiction, or merging). Like I said, slightly ponderous and abstract in those places. <br><br>I hope Clark continues to write and get published. For me, \u201cThe Sleepwalkers\u201d was a masterpiece.",

It took me awhile to get un-confused, and a bit of Googling too, and even then not 100% of what Ryan says makes sense when taking Chapter 7 into account.

But now the sleep of ages was broken, and bugle and drum told the astonished forest that its doom was pronounced and its days numbered.</span>",

The golden childhood of the boy Prince in the Van Dyck pictures gave way to an adventurous youth in Civil War England and abroad, ending traumatically when his father was executed in 1649. Charles II, King at eighteen, succeeded to &#039;nothing but the name&#039;. After his valiant attempt to regain the throne was defeated by Cromwell at Worcester, the King made his epic escape - to years of exile, poverty and humiliation in Europe. The &#039;miraculous&#039; Restoration ushered in a reign coloured by a series of equally dramatic events: the Great Plague, the Fire of London, two Dutch Wars, the bizarre Popish Plot, and finally the efforts of the Whigs to exclude his Catholic brother James from the succession, culminating in the King&#039;s unexpected triumph over them at the Oxford Parliament of 1681.</span>",

He would, I have no doubt, be disappointed in each and everyone of them if they would be next to him in the trenches. <br>the thing is that OP disregards the merits of casual sport and excercising. there is no inherit disadvantage in exercising or playing on one&#039;s terms and conditions for one&#039;s own benefit. <br><br>if your day to day life involves movement and physical activity then doing a sport may be rendered moot, but as most here are fucking neets with little to no activities outside of doom scrolling and maybe reading then any form of exercising will be a net benefit. anything other than that is pure cope to justify their lazyness.<br><br>I don&#039;t think any sane person will tell you to just read or just play sports, you can do both in almost equal measure.<br><br>What I&#039;m more surprised by is the fact that even though Musil argument was used as a counterexample, none of the detractors of sports took into consideration that he died while exercising.

Perhaps it&#039;s because I&#039;ve read quite a bit of odd fantasy; if all I read was mainstream stuff, then I&#039;d surely find Wolfe unpredictable, since he is a step above them. But compared to Leiber, Howard, Dunsany, Eddison, Kipling, Haggard, Peake, Mieville, or Moorcock, Wolfe is nothing special.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Perhaps I just got my hopes up too high. I imagined something that might evoke Peake or Leiber (at his best), perhaps with a complexity and depth gesturing toward Milton or Ariosto. I could hardly imagine a better book than that, but even a book half that good would be a delight--or a book that was nothing like that, but was unpredictable and seductive in some other way.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I kept waiting for something to happen, but it never really did. It all plods along without much rise or fall, just the constant moving action to make us think something interesting is happening. I did find some promise, some moments that I would have loved to see the author explore, particularly those odd moments where Silver Age Sci Fi crept in, but each time he touched upon these, he would return immediately to the smallness of his plot and his annoying prick of a narrator. I never found the book to be difficult or complex, merely tiring. the unusual parts were evasive and vague, and the dull parts constant and repetitive.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The whole structure (or lack of it) does leave things up to interpretation, and perhaps that&#039;s what some readers find appealing: that they can superimpose their own thoughts and values onto the narrator, and onto the plot itself. But at that point, they don&#039;t like the book Wolfe wrote, they like the book they are writing between his lines.</span>",

His corpse is entombed, and then he learns that he&#039;s dead in that place till the new sun is born, that&#039;s the revealing chat he has with the hierodules.

There\u2019s nothing in the Quran that compares to the gospels, which are more like the hadiths in practice, but quite notably different from Jewish or Islamic teachings. It\u2019s no surprise Jews says Muslims are closer to their faith in practice than Christians, as the Quran reads like the Pentateuch. In any case, what exactly is unique about the Quran other than it\u2019s read and recited Arabic and was preserved well once an official Quran was established?",

The fact that he regarded Zeus in such terms caused him to reject the myths about Zeus (or the other gods) that he found objectionable. Particularly in books two and three of the Republic, Socrates criticizes the poets&#039; depiction of Zeus, citing specific examples. For, example:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What would you say again to the tale of Zeus, who, while other gods and men were asleep and he the only person awake, lay devising plans, but forgot them all in a moment through his lust, and was so completely overcome at the sight of Here ([Hera]) that he would not even go into the hut, but wanted to lie with her on the ground, declaring that he had never been in such a state of rapture before, even when they first met one another</span><br><br>Or:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Then we must not listen to Homer or to any other poet who is guilty of the folly of saying that two casks</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u2018Lie at the threshold of Zeus, full of lots, one of good, the other of evil lots,\u2019</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and that he to whom Zeus gives a mixture of the two</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u2018Sometimes meets with evil fortune, at other times with good;\u2019</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but that he to whom is given the cup of unmingled ill,</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u2018Him wild hunger drives o\u2019er the beauteous earth.\u2019</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And again\u2014</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u2018Zeus, who is the dispenser of good and evil to us.\u2019</span><br><br>And about Hesiod:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;First of all, I said, there was that greatest of all lies in high places, which the poet told about Uranus, and which was a bad lie too,\u2014I mean what Hesiod says that Uranus did, and how Cronus retaliated on him. The doings of Cronus, and the sufferings which in turn his son inflicted upon him, even if they were true, ought certainly not to be lightly told to young and thoughtless persons; if possible, they had better be buried in silence. But if there is an absolute necessity for their mention, a chosen few might hear them in a mystery, and they should sacrifice not a common (Eleusinian) pig, but some huge and unprocurable victim; and then the number of the hearers will be very few indeed.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why, yes, said he, those stories are extremely objectionable.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yes, Adeimantus, they are stories not to be repeated in our State; the young man should not be told that in committing the worst of crimes he is far from doing anything outrageous; and that even if he chastises his father when he does wrong, in whatever manner, he will only be following the example of the first and greatest among the gods.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I entirely agree with you, he said; in my opinion those stories are quite unfit to be repeated.</span><br><br>(Apologies for the lackluster translation.)<br>https://www.gutenberg.org/files/149<wbr>7/1497-h/1497-h.htm",

Now contemplate, Socrates, how great a proof I will tell you that the law is so disposed\u2014a proof, which I have already told to others as well, that these things would be correctly done if they take place in this way\u2014that one is not to give way to the impious one, whoever he happens to be. Human beings themselves believe that Zeus is the best and most just of the gods, at the same time that they agree that he bound his own father because he gulped down his sons without justice, and that the latter, in turn, castrated his own father because of other such things. Yet they are angry at me because I am proceeding against my father when he has done injustice, and so they contradict themselves both concerning the gods and concerning me. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;S: Is this, Euthyphro, why I am a defendant against the indictment: that whenever someone says such things about the gods, I receive them somehow with annoyance? Because of this, as is likely, someone will assert that I am a wrongdoer. So now, if these things seem so to you too, who know well about such things, it is certainly necessary, as is likely, for us to concede them as well. For what else shall we say, since we ourselves also agree that we know nothing about them? But tell me, before the god of friendship, do you truly hold that these things have happened in this way? </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;E: Yes, and things even more wondrous than these, Socrates, which the many do not know. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;S: And do you hold that there really is war among the gods against one another, and terrible enmities and battles, and many other such things, as are spoken of by the poets and with which our sacred things have been adorned by the good painters, particularly the robe filled with such adornments which is brought up to the Acropolis in the Great Panathenaea?

Think about what it feels like to write for a living.<br>The institution of capitalism basically doesn&#039;t care for you. It will take you and maybe reward you if you happen to succeed without its help, but also it will keep pressuring you to crank out uninspired marketable slop that can&#039;t push boundaries because it narrows the addressable market. If you try to peddle your services as a TV/video game/etc writer, the salary is shit, the pressure to be sellable is even higher, projects fail all the time and there is no meritocratic way to advance your career, because everything is very high-school and dependent on who you know.<br>These people are basically living capitalism on hard mode. It is no surprise that they are left-wing, which in the US translates to progressive. <br>This then has downstream effects on what the institutions that teach writing look like, what people that talk about writing are like, and the rest. <br>I bet it&#039;s very much the same with other art forms.

Here\u2019s a breakdown to help you choose the Library of America edition that suits your taste and reading goals:<br><br><br>---<br><br> Flannery O\u2019Connor<br><br>Tone: Darkly comic, Catholic-inflected, grotesque<br>Best for: Readers who enjoy sharp moral vision, brutal irony, and philosophical depth<br>Core themes: Grace, redemption, pride, violence, religious hypocrisy<br>Style: Concise, ironic, symbol-laden, allegorical<br><br> What You Get in the LOA Edition:<br><br>Wise Blood (novel)<br><br>The Violent Bear It Away (novel)<br><br>A Good Man Is Hard to Find (stories)<br><br>Everything That Rises Must Converge (stories)<br><br>Essays and letters (if you get the companion volume)<br><br><br> Why Choose Her?<br><br>Every sentence is loaded\u2014she writes with scalpel precision.<br><br>Her short stories are widely considered among the best in American literature.<br><br>If you like themes of grace through suffering and extreme moral confrontations, she delivers.<br><br><br> Caveat:<br><br>Very Catholic. Even if you\u2019re not religious, this influences the tone and themes heavily.<br><br>Her characters are grotesque and often hard to sympathize with\u2014but that\u2019s part of the point.<br>---<br><br> Carson McCullers<br><br>Tone: Melancholic, lyrical, psychologically tender<br>Best for: Readers who value emotional nuance, loneliness, and poetic prose<br>Core themes: Isolation, disability, love, gender ambiguity, Southern alienation<br>Style: Dreamy, introspective, fluid<br><br> What You Get in the LOA Edition:<br><br>The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter (novel)<br><br>Reflections in a Golden Eye (novel)<br><br>The Member of the Wedding (novella)<br><br>Clock Without Hands (novel)<br><br>Stories and plays<br><br><br> Why Choose Her?<br><br>The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter is one of the most affecting debut novels ever written.<br><br>She has a deep compassion for outsiders: deaf-mutes, queer-coded characters, misfits.<br><br>Her prose is more emotional, less didactic than O\u2019Connor\u2019s.<br><br><br> Caveat:<br><br>Some may find her pacing slow or sentimental.<br><br>The narrative power is more in the atmosphere and characters than in plot or moral punch.<br>---<br><br> Verdict:<br><br>Pick O\u2019Connor if you want tight, piercing stories with a philosophical punch and Southern Gothic surrealism that sticks in your gut.<br><br>Pick McCullers if you want tender, melancholic explorations of human longing and identity, wrapped in poetic prose.<br><br><br>If you&#039;re more of a short story reader, go O\u2019Connor.<br>If you prefer novels with strong emotional undercurrents, go McCullers.<br><br><br>---<br><br>If I had to pick one for lasting literary impact, I&#039;d say O&#039;Connor. But if you&#039;re in a mood for the soulful ache of unspoken desires, McCullers is hard to beat.<br><br>Would you like a sample passage from each to compare styles?",

But you have no direct experience of anything outside your head. Your head hosts a living microcosmos that only partially maps to the &quot;real&quot; world through memories formed from sense information.

Say what you want about Mathers, but he lived half his life in a library extracting keys which have been vindicated with later scholarship, putting aside his peculiarities. <br>Now onto the specifics of the creation of GD, Mathers claims instruction from Secret Chiefs. Others claim it was just scholarship on his part. And again others like Kenneth Grant say the Secret Chiefs moved onto Crowley as the podcast host, having found Mathers as wanting in the intellectual department. Many side to this argument. Some have weight; others don&#039;t. The potency of the argument unfortunately depends on your position, as you have acknowledged. In any case, I appreciate the dance.",

Some people define magic and miracles as irruptions of impossible but I am not attached to that definition. As Asimov says, any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. And one might say vice reversa is true as well. The connections between magic and art are undeniable as well. In fact, iirc, many have described magic as the supreme art.<br><br>That said, magic goes against the scientific orthodoxy of our days by positing a spiritual realm and spiritual entities. Calling these purely products of one&#039;s mind or ayyylmaos seems to me an attempt to kowtow to scientific orthodoxy by giving a pseudo scientific scifi veneer to such things. This strikes me as both dishonest and inaccurate as description of experience as well. I say this as someone w much experience in occult and esoterica.<br><br><br>That said, if ayys exist. And advanced tech too. That would explain magic to some degree.<br><br>But given current scientific knowledge, it seems unlikely that ayys would be able to breathe our atmosphere and adapt to our gravity... then again, Kenneth Grant says they communicate psychicly across great distances and I guess that is possible too.<br><br>Nevertheless, I think considering everything placebo or mind based is foolish and even to some degree may hamstring a serious magical practice.",

And if there be any sound that can produce a silence, we may surely be silent about the end and the extremity; when a cry was driven out of that darkness in words dreadfully distinct and dreadfully unintelligible, which man shall never understand in all the eternity they have purchased for him; and for one annihilating instant an abyss that is not for our thoughts had opened even in the unity of the absolute; and God had been forsaken of God.</span><br><br>I think kind of similarly captures that mood at the end. It kind of touches on a common existentialist point of the fullness of being is sort of not something we can access. That the visions of goodness and badness we see are sort of projections of our false understandings onto things and our wrestling is kind of coming to grips with it. <br><br>i think Gabriel Marcels&#039; the mystery of being is the closest I can think of to that sort of Christian existentialist perspective. (Chesterton had much more in common with modern thinkers like nietzsche then he is typically given credit for)",

A mother does not give her child a blue bow because he is so ugly without it. A lover does not give a girl a necklace to hide her neck. If men loved Pimlico as mothers love children, arbitrarily, because it is THEIRS, Pimlico in a year or two might be fairer than Florence. Some readers will say that this is a mere fantasy. I answer that this is the actual history of</span><br>mankind. This, as a fact, is how cities did grow great. Go back to the darkest roots of civilization and you will find them knotted round some sacred stone or encircling some sacred well. People first paid honour to a spot and afterwards gained glory for it. Men did not love Rome because she was great. She was great because they had loved her.<br><br>and tying it to napoleon the end conversation between adam and quin is one of my favorite sections from anything Chesterton has written, i tried to quote it but I just love that entire final chapter<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Suppose I am God,&quot; said the voice, &quot;and suppose I made the world in idleness. Suppose the stars, that you think eternal, are only the idiot fireworks of an everlasting schoolboy. Suppose the sun and the moon, to which you sing alternately, are only the two eyes of one vast and sneering giant, opened alternately in a never-ending wink. Suppose the trees, in my eyes, are as foolish as enormous toad-stools. Suppose Socrates and Charlemagne are to me only beasts, made funnier by walking on their hind legs. Suppose I am God, and having made things, laugh at them.&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;And suppose I am man,&quot; answered the other. &quot;And suppose that I give the answer that shatters even a laugh.

But suppose, standing up straight under the sky, with every power of my being, I thank you for the fools&#039; paradise you have made.</span><br><br>I think the connection between these two is kind of clear.

You have to be willing to embrace the idea of that patriotic attachment to neighborhood and then in entertaining it be a fanatic and play it out and be responsible and grateful to whatever is revealed in it to those fanatical extremes. It even has that kind of greek or nietzschean glory of the soldier and violence of war that comes from that.

It\u2019s got breezy pacing for such a long book, and does a good job of showing all the characters at different points in their lives. But the best part is Howard, and how the other characters bounce off of him and react to his existence. Most of the cast feel like relatively realistic people, albeit a bit too clear in what they represent. But Howard is like an alien. He\u2019s this total, ironclad gigachad that embodies egotism to the core. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s intentional or not, but I found him to be a brilliantly funny character. His conversations with Keating\u2019s mom and the dean immediately hooked me when I started reading. He\u2019s so hilariously sure of himself that it bewilders the people around him.",

No, I do not object to soul-searching and self-revelation, but in those books the soul, and the sins, and the sentimentality, and the journalese, hardly warrant the tedious and muddled search. Dostoyevsky\u2019s lack of taste, his monotonous dealings with persons suffering with pre-Freudian complexes, the way he has of wallowing in the tragic misadventures of human dignity \u2013 all this is difficult to admire. I do not like this trick his characters have of \u201dsinning their way to Jesus\u201d or, as a Russian author, Ivan Bunin, put it more bluntly, \u201dspilling Jesus all over the place.&quot; Crime and Punishment\u2019s plot did not seem as incredibly banal in 1866 when the book was written as it does now when noble prostitutes are apt to be received a little cynically by experienced readers. Dostoyevsky never really got over the influence which the European mystery novel and the sentimental novel made upon him. The sentimental influence implied that kind of conflict he liked\u2014placing virtuous people in pathetic situations and then extracting from these situations the last ounce of pathos. Non-Russian readers do not realize two things: that not all Russians love Dostoevsky as much as Americans do, and that most of those Russians who do, venerate him as a mystic and not as an artist. He was a prophet, a claptrap journalist and a slapdash comedian. I admit that some of his scenes, some of his tremendous farcical rows are extraordinarily amusing. But his sensitive murderers and soulful prostitutes are not to be endured for one moment\u2014by this reader anyway. Dostoyevsky seems to have been chosen by the destiny of Russian letters to become Russia\u2019s greatest playwright, but he took the wrong turning and wrote novels.",

But when you read something, there is always a degree of expectation from the act if reading. Maybe its catharsis, maybe its the pleasure of watching the scenes plays out. In a novel length book, these \u201cpayoffs\u201d are spread sporadically throughout the hundred of pages. The fillers in between which makes up the majority of a book, while reinforced the endorphine rush from these payoffs, are ultimately not exactly what you are looking for when you picked up a book. Compare this to journal length articles, WNs, video essays, and other intellectual slops where the payoffs are far more condensed or at the very least, the desirable parts are more identifiable.<br>Now, for me personally, the irony is, my OCD tendencies that has forced me in the past reading every single word in a /lit/ work. Has now work against me by forcing me to cut corners due to the ampount of stuff floating in the internet that caught my eyes.",

Let it go. Mediums and formats grow old and only survive as a hobby for the few.

There&#039;s no going around this. Learn how to deal with lengthy blocks of words. That&#039;s literally your best and only way, as a human, to present and understand complex information about anything.<br>And no, video essays or lectures won&#039;t have the same impact on you, if only for the fact that you are just passively receiving someone&#039;s words and can space out at will. Reading requires your full attention, which means you will retain and understand complex information better than you would by just listening to someone speaking.<br>I am purposedly turning this into a longpost now because I think you should honestly worried about how large the potential for royally fucking a non-reading generation in the ass is. Someone who isn&#039;t capable to process complex information also loses any ability to distinguish between reliable and non-reliable information, which means you become most vulnerable to any sort of proapaganda - a modern version of a medieval illiterate farmer, ready to believe whatever the local priest says (only there&#039;s now 1000 local priests at war with each other). <br>You can literally measure how much the level of public discourse has gets lowered in passing from expert discussion to the newspaper form (from books to articles) and then from articles to the popularized talk show format, where politicians make vague and inarticulate points simplifying complex issues - the ultimate form of which are the US presidential debates, in which the illiterate voters of an illiterate country choose who is going to rule the world based on 1h of banter between geriatric billionaires.<br>The idea that complex information can be simplified is an illusion and a trap, and falling for it in a reality where the state made libraries free for everyone and you can download books from the internet is inexcusable, and the ultimate victory of evil over good.<br>Your inability to understand what is going on has been groomed since birth, through television and now phones. This is to keep you at your workpost until you die, and extract as much energy and value from you as possible while giving you the bare minimum. You NEED the ability to process complex chunks information not in order to change the world and make a revolution, but because you don&#039;t want to be sodomized on a daily basis by people who are more powerful than you are. <br>You need to be able to spend 30+ hours reading books about any political subject before being able to BEGIN forming a nuanced opinion on it. The rest is you parroting youtube videos - and it will show: not only in how you speak, but also in how you vote, in the political action you will or will not take, in the amount of change you&#039;ll be able to introduce in your life and that of your family and your community, and ultimately in how hard you are getting fucked in the ass.",
