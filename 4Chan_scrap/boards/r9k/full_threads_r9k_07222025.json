The time with which you are muted for doubles with each transgression.<br>3. Each mute time is 2^n in seconds where n is the number of times you have transgressed. So, your mute time doubles each time you fuck up.<br>4. Backlinks, eg <span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;1</span>, are not viewed by the robot. So &quot;lolwut&quot; and &quot;<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;2</span> lolwut&quot; are the same post, in the eyes of the robot.<br>5. Gibberish at the end of a post to force originality may result in mod intervention (no BLOX posts please).<br>6. Images are NOT included in the filter, only text.<br>7. Your mute count slowly decreases over time.<br>8. You cannot post a picture without text.<br>9. Unicode is blocked. Sorry, too many exploits (Cyrillic letters, etc).<br>10. Posts require a certain minimum amount of original content in order to be posted.<br>11. Post sane, real content, well thought out replies, and mutes are unlikely.<br>12.

ITS SOMEHOW HIS FAULT CAUSE WOMAN ARE TOO INNOCENT AND PRETTY TO DO THAT. literally all women do example my mom is cry rape or harassment whenever they hate a guy and ruin his life or use being a man against him SOLEY because of his gender AND IT SOMEHOW WORKS BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY THATS GENUINELY RETARDED. so am i sexist against myself and my own yes yes i am. and i will continue to be until society can go back to the good old days of being able to legally beat the shot out of a woman and nobody cares because they deserve it with all the shit they do nowadays like being totally retarded assholes and using the pretty face to get away with it. woman genuinely need to learn to be subservient to men again. photo is how i feel. there im done. fuck foids. kek.",

It&#039;s unfortunate and sick for sure. But it&#039;s more a personal thing for me. I HATE how women ACT and TALK and EVERYTHING. Fake kindness, this act of trying to be cutesy and silly and different, I CANNOT STAND IT. They&#039;re all egotistical whores that the entire world falls to their whims. Everyone I care about will fall victim to loving a woman. They enjoy having this power to take everyone from you. God they just seriously piss me off, normies are braindead NPCs that are just programmed for nothing and are useless and worthless, but then there are the women who think they&#039;re quirky and cute and into unique things. They will treat anyone like shit the instant you see them for what they really are. They enjoy taking everyone you love away from you. They have these retarded fake interests just to attract attention. They are attention hungry stupid fucking femoids. Whenever I see a girl post a video of herself or photo I genuinely feel disgusted. <br><br>It&#039;s probably bad to think this way. But it is what it is. I don&#039;t want praise or recognition, like some people might think. It&#039;s really unhealthy to feel this way. But FUCK I hate them. So. Much. They repeat stupid shit they hear of tiktok and twitter, they aren&#039;t funny, they don&#039;t have anything of value to say thoughtfully. They&#039;re shallow whores. I hate everyone though, I&#039;m probably just a schizoid or something I hate men too but it&#039;s a general everyone in the world sucks problem there&#039;s just specifics I can point to.

When you look at the big picture there is definitely some kind of inherent conflict or adversarial nature between the sexes.

I think that&#039;s your adversarial system, it&#039;s almost too good to be true because it explains everything, the compulsory partner disposal process, the collective action, the extreme in-group bias, basically everything and it can be clearly observed in nature as I have explained in the wall of text. It can be reduced to a very simple recurring pattern. <br>It&#039;s millions of years of female immune systems recognizing the Y chromosome as a foreign object and cytokines repeatedly translating that event to brain states. Their brains just evolved to sense the Y chromosome, male pregnancy and it&#039;s product as something foreign that doesn&#039;t exist in their bodies.<br><br>It also explains men&#039;s neutrality, why they are far more likely to just let go of themselves and chill in relationships, they don&#039;t seek a way out, they don&#039;t feel trapped.

As you say if this is the result of millions of years of behavior being shaped by signals coming from the immune system, it seems like in order to falsify this we need to interrogate the brain itself (assuming that all other claims that lead up to this interaction are accurate). So getting a reasonable experiment that properly targets this hypothesis and fails to falsify the claim seems to put this in the set of theories that require a more complete understanding of the brain.

Lets call people who grew up believing X and later found out !X, often due to quickly jumping to conclusions, type 1 people. And lets let type 2 people be those who tend to wait for evidence and are less quick to form their models of reality early on when things are more uncertain. I&#039;m suggesting that type 2 people seem to be mostly a (relatively small) subset of the male population. And I believe this even closer to a subset of the male population of when the topic under analysis is related to the nature of the sexes.",

It&#039;s not just Westerners who hate Indians, but even Middle Eastern people are very openly hateful against Indians and consider them as an inferior race. <br><br>From a humanitarian and practical perspective, there&#039;s no solution to the hate. Even if India solves its problems of pollution and poverty they will continue to be hated because of their physical appearance and accent. I have seen even other ESLs who speak broken English making fun of the Indian accent. I have seen brown skinned westernized Arabs calling Indians &quot;brown&quot; and &quot;shitskin&quot;. Indian workers are treated like subhumans in Gulf countries and it is socially acceptable to be racist to them. It&#039;s really interesting how other brown people hate Indians say more than White people do.",

The moment you mention you are Indian the &quot;pajeet&quot; and ridicule of Indian accent and Hinduism will come to you at the speed of light. People who were treating you nicely will suddenly hate you. <br><br>I can&#039;t reconcile with this because no American or other foreigner when I lived abroad has ever been racist to me in real life. Why does all this only exist online? <br><br>The real life racism in America seems to be against Mexicans, and in Europe it&#039;s against Arabs and other Muslims. The real life hate against Indians is very mild in the Western world. It&#039;s more real in Gulf states where Indians are treated like slaves.",

The Mongols attacked and occupied almost all of East Asia, destroying it, but the Mongol emperor gave Korea the right to maintain its national title and autonomy, and gave his only blood relative, his daughter, a princess, to the Korean king as a wife. This was unprecedented in Mongol history. Because The Mongol emperor and nobles never gave their women to non-Mongols. This is a stark contrast to the Mongols who treated the Chinese as slaves of the lowest class. The king of Korea was the only non-Mongol who had the right to vote in the election to elect the Mongol emperor, though.",

If she did as well, then it&#039;s back to the 95 IQ Stacy. I don&#039;t mind a woman not being super smart that much, as long as she doesn&#039;t have serious mental deficiencies, and as long as she&#039;s intellectually humble. Of course, the smarter the better, and if the girl is already cute, then it&#039;s a massive boost, but if she lacks intellectual humility, then I wouldn&#039;t even be friends with her, let alone date her. When it comes to women&#039;s salaries: I don&#039;t care. My view is, that if I cannot fully financially support a woman and her lifestyle, even if she quits her job for whatever reason, then I&#039;m not worth dating her. Meaning that whatever money a woman makes is completely irrelevant to me, and could even be a detriment, if she makes too much, because I wouldn&#039;t be able support her at the standard of living she&#039;s used to, if she quits her job.",

Someone fat or obese, autistic, ugly, unpleasant, not your preferred race, or all of the above, it doesn&#039;t really matter. Truly, they are out there by the numbers, reading gooner yaoi slop because they don&#039;t have any warmth in their life. All you have to do is be somewhat nice to them and pretend to listen to them when they blabber on about their interests (since no one ever has), and boom, their pussy is yours.<br><br>If undesirable foids really wanted a boyfriend, literally just date any low value man you could find (autistic, fat, retard, neet, etc) and he will slobber all over you. Yes they will probably be socially stunted, overly perverted and perhaps a genuine drain on your will to live, but at least they&#039;ll love you, even if in their own way.<br><br>The reason this doesn&#039;t happen is because both genders have convinced themselves to deserve best of the best by virtue of existing. You simply don&#039;t. It&#039;s cruel, but you cannot expect someone to open up their legs or lovingly undress you when they don&#039;t even like looking at you and there are plenty more desirable options for them. Just settle for less. OF and Instagram models you blast your brain with every day are in the top 0.1%, most women are mid or ugly. Yaoi/ Girlslop men don&#039;t exist, most moids simply don&#039;t have empathy, you just gotta live with that. <br><br>But of course none of you will, because you are all lazy, ungrateful and entitled. This is where the term incel comes in, with an emphasis on the &#039;involuntary&#039; part of involuntary celibate. There is just no way in hell that it&#039;s an &quot;involuntary&quot; condition when there are so many options for you, even if you may not be attracted to them.

You say you would like x and hate y, but in practice you avoid x and actively engage with y. You&#039;re telling me you only have sexual flings and are unable to maintain a relationship because of certain fears, yet complain about others only focusing on sex and not relationships? To help you, I&#039;ll let you in on a little secret: more than half of women don&#039;t cum during sex, and we can pick pretty much whoever to have it with. Would you &quot;only care about sex&quot; under those circumstances? Or would you choose carefully who to have it with? I think you&#039;re projecting a behavior you have and hate onto others to justify engaging with it (promiscuity). The problem is actually with women, and therefore you&#039;re just victim to a circumstance. Virgin women or women with a low body count who care about their sexual partners wouldn&#039;t be with someone like you, I&#039;m sorry to say. Because again, you receive what you give",

Now her phone isn&#039;t working and I don&#039;t know what she&#039;s using now. She texted me with her aunt&#039;s phone weeks ago and that didn&#039;t go well (aunt probably got pissed) so unless I go through her aunt I can&#039;t reach her. But I&#039;m so anxious and her aunt doesn&#039;t like me. Now all I can do is send the phone but I dont even know if she&#039;s okay or is at the address currently.",

So many guys have gfs yet I never had one outside of one online where she ended up ghosting me after 6 months. I am still a khhv I just want to hug a girl and cuddle with her while we watch a movie or anime together. I look normal, I am tall, I have even lost most of my fat and I am no longer overweight. Is autism really such a curse. I just want to give love and receive love back why is that I never ever get a real chance.",

You did say you have a desire &quot;to love&quot; but from a woman&#039;s perspective, what is that truly worth? So you want to fondle and kiss and gyrate. All on the tab of your own calorie expenditure. How thoughtful. I&#039;m glad I was mistaken. <br><br>So since none of this bothers you and you&#039;d rather remain a virgin, then you can stop complaining about being a KHHV. Now, to your currently halved demand of affection and love: You should be made aware that love in any form is conditional and it is a tremendous burden on the part of the thing doing the loving. However, it is freely received. This means that you cannot compel anyone or anything towards loving you, and you can only strive towards the higher likelihood of the same outcome as compulsion. Striving will feel like a burden to the point of wasting away to nothing. <br><br>Fortunately for you, the insular and cushy modern times we live in (at present) make this burden exceedingly light. Technically, you can feel affection for anything in your life that you&#039;ve grown fond of simply by its proximity to you. It could be a goldfish on your desk. But you mentioned wanting physical affection, and for that you will need something a little bigger. For a dog that thinks you&#039;re its adoptive father, affection for you is the most likely outcome. Obviously it will be expensive, so just take time out for it and make more money. These burdens would be easy to shoulder if you&#039;re motivated by love to begin with, but since you are an &quot;empty and would be filled&quot; type, it will be significantly harder unless you somehow experience an internal paradigm shift and are suddenly a &quot;full and flows over&quot; type. <br><br>So yeah. TL;DR:<br>If you want to do this the secular way: work up to getting the dog.<br>Or get-your-ass-to-Mass as they say and pray for a pittance of grace from God Himself to fix the problem at its root.",

To avoid this, 4chan might choose to block UK users voluntarily. Either way, it is very likely that after October 25th, 2025, UK users will lose direct access to 4chan through ISP blocks or self-imposed geo-blocking.",

They always say men mark their territory by pissing on trees, but that&#039;s only trees and never for fun. Then what are women, who are pissing all over the place for the lols after a singular or two beers?

On the other hand, there are many examples of handsome men who are overwhelmingly respected and almost revered by men because they&#039;re still masculine and, most importantly, really good at their craft (and it&#039;s this that men really look for in other men, we place a lot of value in all sorts of niche activities and whoever is the guy at the top of those is the gigachad in men&#039;s eyes).

It isn&#039;t someone obsessively showering you in affection like some think. A love bomber is someone who insincerely showers someone with excessive affection to make people get hooked on the attention, because once you are hooked they then can withdraw that affection and switch to using the silent treatment to force compliance. Someone just showering crazy amounts of affection, but not weaponizing withdrawal of affection isn&#039;t a love bomber. They are clingy.",

        "com": "I was watching this video, and I was wondering what female narcissist sexuality is like. They dehumanize everyone, so she&#039;ll always view you as her inferior. They are going to be hypergamous, but she&#039;s probably just going to be showing you off as her trophy, but only for ego reasons. LOOK at my BOYFRIEND! (She&#039;s not a single girl.) LOOK at how HOT he is! (She is clearly better than you for having a better boyfriend.) Meanwhile, to her, you are literally just a piece of shit not worthy of any semblance of respect or compassion. She would be using you as narcissistic armor in front of others and for narcissistic supply. She is literally incapable of loving you. Even if she reproduces with you, she would be creepily using the children as trophies and showing them off while being an emotional parasite and bullying them at home, trying to make them feel ashamed of everything. Narcissism arises from the lack of capacity to process and regulate shame.<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_<wbr>Jte7Bado<br><br>Would a pathological narcissist woman even give shit tests? It seems like something women do without even being self aware of it. Why do they do it? If she&#039;s making sure that a man is strong / masculine enough, then why would a narcissist woman do shit tests? She wouldn&#039;t want to even consider you as potentially being stronger than her. She wants to view you as being inferior to her. She would just use you as narcissistic armor to make herself look better in front of others.",

At home, she would be cold and abusive to you, trying to get as much narcissistic supply out of you as possible. This means she would constantly be lecturing you, demanding praise, demanding apologies, demanding pity, insulting you, telling you you&#039;re not doing enough for her, and it would never end. She would never change. If you criticized her or make her feel ashamed of anything, which would only last for a split second to possibly just a couple seconds, then she would rage at you before she would even be able to consciously process the emotion of shame. In the process of raging, she would try to make you feel really ashamed of yourself. Pathological narcissism essentially arises from an inability to process and regulate shame. It causes an immense amount of pain in narcissists, and their brain has a crazy reaction to it that just tells them to rage. All their behavior and personality is shaped around avoiding shame. A narcissist woman would drain you emotionally and financially. If she&#039;s really sadistic, she could psychologically break you.",

        "com": "First of all, every year about a dozen unarmed people are killed by the cops, but there was no international outrage for any of them. Why is that?<br><br>Secondly there&#039;s no epidemic of police killings. The chance of getting killed by the police while unarmed is literally, LITERALLY, statistically verifiably, 1 in a million. Washington Post reported that. Of course I had some retarded left winger saying, &quot;We should keep rioting until that number is zero!&quot; Like, you faggot. That&#039;s completely economically impossible. Why don&#039;t you protest lightning strikes? Because that kills more people. Oh right, because the TV didn&#039;t tell you to. You mindless golem.<br><br>Thirdly, of all the people they could pick to blow up on international news, they picked a guy who robbed a pregnant woman and pointed the gun at her belly, and made home-made porn films of himself. Autopsy revealed he had a lethal dose of fentanyl in his system, as well as a cocktail of other drugs collectively known as speedball. The famous line, &quot;I can&#039;t breath,&quot; he was saying that in the back of the police car, where nobody was touching him. Because he was overdosing. The knee on his neck is a standard, nonlethal move, because you still have a free artery on the other side. Though 9 minutes might be excessive, it&#039;s a risk to let a huge 6&#039;6 violent chimp with a criminal record the chance to get up and escape, while you try to reposition for another move.<br><br>THIS is the guy they decided to blow up on international news? Of all the people they could have picked from? Why? Because he was the most recent case they had to work with. To divide the nation during election season.<br><br>You don&#039;t even have to know anything about this case to know it&#039;s bullshit. If people just knew BASIC stats. That his happens a handful of times every year. People would smell it as soon as Jews started trying to blow this up. Being red pilled makes me so mad. It&#039;s like living in the twilight zone.",

If it&#039;s lasted that long and hasn&#039;t been helped by any typical antidepressant then the few remaining options are antipsychotics (which can sometimes help mood and personality disorders, not just psychotic disorders) and of course hallucinogens. If you are sure you want to go down the path of the latter, then feel free to ask about it.<br><br>A part of me feels that if it was possible for it to change unexpectedly (such as for that one month) then I imagine trying out hormonal supplementation (such as testosterone, or the ceasing of birth control, if you are male/female respectively) could be an option, too. Also other lifestyle things like diet could influence it, look up &quot;metabolic psychiatry&quot; cuz I&#039;ve heard of it being effective for psychotic disorders.",

The Soviet Union was based and trad under Stalin. He banned abortions and restored the Russian Orthodox Church, which was persecuted during Lenin&#039;s time. Stalin and Mao were based, and Hitler was kinda based too, but also a retard, he should have allied with Stalin instead of backstabbing him and having to fight a war on two fronts at once, not to mention his failed African campaign. Putin and Xi are alright, but they&#039;re too liberal in some ways. They don&#039;t even persecute the rainbow gangs, and they&#039;re too easy on traitors within their elites. But I still wish Trump were more like them, sadly, he&#039;s even more liberal, and he isn&#039;t draining the swamp as hard as he promised, he&#039;s all bark no bite, didn&#039;t even lock Killary up when he had an opportunity.",

What, you think if you support a dictator in their rise to power, it&#039;s gonna win you favors? Study the histories of authoritarian movements. You&#039;ll be killed along with the other retards, because you pose a threat. If it won&#039;t happen immediately, it will happen some time down the line. And if you want to just be an ordinary citizen, then imagine this: you wont agree with everything the authoritarian leader does. And the leader has no checks ensuring that whatever they do should be in service of the country and the people, and not just in service of e.g. their own hedonistic pleasures. And you&#039;d have no recourse. If the leader kills your entire family, because you looked at him funny, or plunges the country into economic depression that leaves you destitute, there&#039;s nothing you can do about it. It&#039;s a cuckold political ideology. But if you want to be the leader, then it&#039;s different. You&#039;ll be granted enormous power. A lot greater than you could ever achieve in a democratic system. Yes, the likelihood that you might get assassinated is higher, but I could see how someone would find it attractive for the power&#039;s sake.",

If I had to guess, it is because the North has a much harsher and more unstable climate and they had to adapt to that. Those facts considered they were actually more sophisticated in some ways, especially of course in naval capacity as their ships mogged the fuck out of anything the Romans produced for several hundred years after, but their societies were extremely stable, functional, merciful and kind, and obviously flourished beyond imagining. Romans had to deal with more browns in their vicinity though, so it is no surprise that they had to focus on military and logistics. But they were pretty much the same people in different environments: problem-solving, pragmatic, kind, autistic Europeans. I love them.",

Dictatorships are the simplest and strongest forms of government, even the Romans would suspend democracy in a crisis to elect a dictator to take sole charge of the crisis. Many look at the chaos of the world today and yearn for a single strong leader to just blast through the politics and the bullshit and set the country right again. Is it idealism, yes, but I can&#039;t blame people for at least being okay with it. But unfortunately, I can think of only two, maybe three, dictators who did more good than harm to their country.",

He&#039;s pretty and funny, but calling his ex his muse would definitely hurt my feelings a lot. I knit, so I could add to his scarf collection. Perhaps we would not date but I would be his illicit scarf dealer in exchange for free coffee.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;5</span><br>There&#039;s a little bit of Charlie Day about him which is a huge plus for me. I&#039;d like to have intellectual discussions with him and maybe I could change his mind and make him think of me as his equal over time. I could definitely beat him into the ground at scrabble.

I can guarantee there&#039;s as many Arab or other foreign guys that do this shit. You just have a stereotype to pick on and you know you can do it without any repercussions.<br>Maybe if you faggots didn&#039;t let people with piss poor education into the country, this wouldn&#039;t be an issue <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It was the left!</span><br>Don&#039;t give a fuck. Both the left and right view immigrants as one big blob, without realizing that there&#039;s a ton of variation even within a country. You&#039;re both to blame.<br>There&#039;s 0 evidence of any Indians in Canada shitting at beaches except for a tiktok video made by a lone druggie who looks like she fucks her dog. That&#039;s it. There&#039;s been 0 recordings, no poop pits or whatever the fuck you claim are there. Nothing&#039;s been found. And ecoli has been an issue for a while. Leaving picrel up for anyone who actually wants to know what&#039;s going on here but I know you don&#039;t, disingenuous baiting faggot. I&#039;m sure you &quot;feel&quot; in your &quot;heart&quot; that you must be right, but either provide evidence or gtfo<br><br>YOUR behavior is not acceptable, lying little prick.",
