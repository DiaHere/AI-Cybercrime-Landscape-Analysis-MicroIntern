Best I could do is AI upscale. I can however make a hardware accelerated graphics engine which uses normal uv mapping and paves the way for someone else to make nice textures. A very easy thing I can do right away is improve the software rendering logic by replacing all the 16.16 fixed point math with floats or even doubles. That would get rid of the weird way textures and polygons sort of walk or wobble around like a PS1, instead they would be nice and perfectly calculated.",

(yes I know it&#039;s based on Thrill Drive fuck off nerd) It doesn&#039;t need all this customization I mean I had plenty of fun with HP2 and Gran Turismo 3 and those games had like basically nothing well apart from wheels in GT3 but you get what I mean man it&#039;s just boring to play. And I&#039;ve heard the game was also going to be online only after they cut the story and that explains a lot actually expect so was Twisted Metal 2012 and that&#039;s still got an arcade death match mode what the hell man! I&#039;ve NEVER been more disappointed in a game purchase ever I&#039;m serious I&#039;ve never bought another Need for Speed game after that I was that angry. (still am) I mean have you ever tried braking a disc after beating a game?

I mean I&#039;m just not happy the only thing I liked was the abandoned airplane graveyard and the weird modern art thingy you could ramp off of and that&#039;s it the rest is shit and I don&#039;t care how autistic I sound and I&#039;ll leave on this. I didn&#039;t even play the original Most Wanted until years later by downloading a pc copy and my opinion on that game is that eh yeh it&#039;s alright I guess, not bad.",

The GT3 tire model update makes those cars okayish to drive now, but driving at the limit is still very risky and feels a bit vague, even with third party FFB apps. It&#039;s one of the sims that lives by the &quot;more punishing physics = more realistic&quot; mantra, which I am not a fan of. ACC is very forgiving in comparison. Part of it might also be due to the fact that iRacing is just a glorified NR2003 mod.<br><br>I bought LMU again since its no longer in EA and I moved onto a DD wheel so maybe it&#039;ll feel slightly better. The tracks playing for the GT3 series recently in iRacing have not been my favorite, so I&#039;m probably gonna take a short break from it till they run Daytona at the IMSA series in a few weeks.",

Oil changes, services plans, warranties, accessories are all fair game.<br><br>5.)In today&#039;s world, internet sales departments are your friend. You can send a blanket email to 3 or 4 dealerships and get them to compete for your business, let them haggle with each other before you ever haggle with them<br><br>6.)Get them to print you a Buyers Order for any car you are seriously, that is what you negotiate from. It will look like pic related, and itemize every line of the sale. Don&#039;t let them 4 square you or hand write shit on a piece of paper. Get a buyers order<br><br>7.)Never be afraid to walk away from a deal. If you have a bad feeling, sleep on it. There will always be other cars",

This thing got fucked by environmental regulations. They wanted to make a cheap car, saw the writing on the wall about cali banning cars and bidens cafe standards, and figured that it needs to be an EV. Well the only problem is, making an EV affordable required the tax deduction, which they no longer have. At this point, they should just put in a cheap radio and power windows so it&#039;s at least slightly competitive even if it bumps the price point up by a thousand.

So why do that when you can buy a fleet of base f150&#039;s that can go 300 miles on a tank of gas, carry much more in terms of payloads, and have a much more reliable gas engine in the end.<br>Slate already showed their primary market is techbro redditors with those &quot;SO RETRO!&quot; graphics they advertise on their website. It&#039;s actually fucking hilarious seeing people who never needed or driven a truck in their entire lives try and convince everyone that they need to abandon their half tons for these overpriced &quot;Simplistic&quot; pieces of e-waste, then jerking off Kei trucks in the same sentence.<br>Just pure vaporware that 90% of &quot;Car guys&quot; drank the koolaid on.",

An EV would cost about $1500 if you&#039;re charging at public chargers, about half that if you charge at home. And if we budget $4,000 for repairs, it would take 4.4 years to break even at $30k.<br><br>Another thing to consider is this is not entirely an apples to apples comparison.

Have you even owned a car or truck before? 10 years is less then half of the lifespan of the vehicle. Most non commercial vehicles should last 30 years at least if taken care of. I&#039;ve been driving old trucks my entire life, so has everyone I know. Most of the time your yearly maintenance will consist of changing the oil, and topping off coolant. If you spent 15k on an old mid size truck, you could easily get one in nice condition. You still have to keep up with maintenance required when you hit certain mileage points, but that isn&#039;t too expensive or difficult to do either. And you would only need to do that once every few years.",

Only things I&#039;ve heard about it are the carbed models being a little touchy with the throttle input, but other than that, I&#039;ve ridden a lot of other vehicles with power and it seems like the 919 is just a better bike than the cb600f overall. My other choice was an sv650 but I&#039;m not the biggest fan of the vtwin. I had considered a katana 600 for a little while but it seems like they&#039;re a little old by now for the most part and its hard to find a newer one in good condition, and I doubt it&#039;d be easy to sell once I grew out of it. There&#039;s 2 or 3 919&#039;s under $3k near me though, so I figure I might pull the trigger on one anyway. I&#039;ll mostly be commuting on it and probably do a handful of rides over 2 hours, so I like the idea of a comfortable seating position too",

Anyways, this jeep was an abortion of a project where most of my time honestly was spent unfucking some else&#039;s fuck ups. Bad wiring, shoddy repairs, zero maintenance, etc and I&#039;m just sick of it.

If you&#039;re only going straight it won&#039;t hurt the drivetrain. It&#039;s the turns that put the stress on the drivetrain. On loose surfaces it allows the wheels to slip, on a paved surface the tires can&#039;t slip until excess stresses have built up or something breaks. <br>That said I put my truck in 4H on a pin straight bit of my drive since it needs to be used according to the manual, ten miles a month. I get a few in every trip down that road. I figure it hasn&#039;t hurt anything since it doesn&#039;t make a pop when it comes out of 4WD like it does when I&#039;ve been using it up in the dirt and it&#039;s still bound up from a turn.",

But that didn&#039;t happen. Instead, the price per pound has roughly doubled, to the point where a fill-up (roughly 300 miles of driving) costs $150-to-$180.

These are very large underground spaces created by injecting water to dissolve geological rock salt. The storage potential of each cavern is large, but they can only be situated where suitable salt formations exist. To take the UK as an example, only areas within Cheshire and East Yorkshire are known to have these formations, so Southeast England, as well as existing industrial clusters in South Wales and in Scotland would be some distance from their nearest storage facility. What this means in practice is that storing hydrogen in salt caverns will mean expensive upgrades to the gas network infrastructure \u2013 a consideration which is invariably overlooked by analysis claiming that these caverns offer a low cost per unit of hydrogen stored. If you add in problems with hydrogen purity, slow access, and even slower lead times, it\u2019s tempting to question whether salt caverns are the right storage solution for industrial hydrogen hubs.<br>At the other end of the scale are Pressurised Metal Vessels. Unlike the caverns these vessels can be located anywhere. But hydrogen storage potential per cylinder is much smaller, and with all the metal required to contain the pressurised hydrogen, they are an expensive option which will take up valuable space on site while presenting a health and safety hazard to nearby (and not so nearby) infrastructure.<br><br>Gravitricity is best known for the solid weight gravity-based energy storage technology which we\u2019ll be deploying in old mine shafts. By finding new uses for old coal mines, we\u2019re demonstrating how the infrastructure of the old energy system can be re-used to enable the new. But we\u2019ve always believed that underground spaces have energy storage potential beyond gravity, and so more recently, alongside our gravity technology development programme, we\u2019ve been focussing on how fuel gases, particularly hydrogen, can be stored safely and effectively underground.",

Toyota&#039;s NA marketing department ran with it and overhyped the living shit out of the GR Corolla because &quot;it&#039;s OUR turn&quot; mentality, even though the reality is GRC is available in Japan, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Australia, etc but of course Americans only believe the marketing.<br><br>The car is good, almost everyone reviewed it positively, maybe except Savagegeese because he is heavily biased towards Honda but even he came around and recognized that GR Corolla shines better in the winter/mixed weather. The general tldr consensus says it feels like a modern Evo 8. Not uncommon for Corvette and Porsche owners to have this in their stable. GR Corolla is NOT &quot;a race car&quot;. It is as much of a rally car as a STI is - it&#039;s a rally derived car.<br><br>What you have been seeing is basically an overcorrection from Toyota&#039;s well oiled marketing machine. It&#039;s a good car, but not immune to typical track fires like the lack of track prep or cooldown laps or switching to proper oil. What you have been seeing in journoslop outlets is them looking for clicks because they know anything mentioning GR Corolla will ride the ripple. Those 2 initial GR Corolla warranty denials that sparked the 85mph meme? Some karen who works warranty for Toyota NA allegedly copy and pasted the denial letter to both owners and reached for the most bullshit reason of denial, which is going faster than 85mph despite the fact the factory PS4 tires are rated for more than that, and Americans get a free NASA track day with purchase.",

Where the fuck am I supposed to go? Literally nobody makes anything that fills that niche anymore, even Subaru when that used to be their bread and butter. Even more infuriating is that they have all the ingredients (Levorg, WRX 2.4 turbo, and 6 speed) but won&#039;t combine them into the combination everyone has been asking for since the 2015 WRX went sedan only, and may I remind you the WRX hatch was 50% of sales, it wasn&#039;t a poor seller. Even if you compromise a little and ask for a Subaru with a cargo area and a manual transmission, but are ok with it being slow, they still don&#039;t even sell that anymore.",

This is largely due to the Charger and Challenger being more practical with their full-size back seats and trunk. To have this additional space, the car consequently must be larger. While often cross-shopped, the Charger/Challenger and Mustang/Camaro are not the same type of vehicle. As one side is a muscle car, the other is a pony car and have different design intentions. The muscle cars sacrifice handling and size for room. The pony cars sacrifice room for handling and size.<br><br>I hope you can understand, dear anon.",

They have literally wasted so much of my time this week that I barely managed 2000 miles when if I had been able to actually fucking drive for all the time I had to spend waiting on them or compensating for them being retarded I could&#039;ve had 2500-2700 instead. <br><br>The driving and even the backing really isn&#039;t that hard, nor is navigating and trip planning. But dealing with dispatch is going to drive me to drink. They&#039;re all just as green as I am which doesn&#039;t speak well to employee retention for this company, and if this keeps up I&#039;m leaving the second my contract is up for greener pastures. And all this for not even forty cents a mile.",

Sure, every poster on /o/ is a tech bro that pulls in $350k+/year if I&#039;m to believe what I read here, but in the real world the average cost of a new car is $50k, with payments regularly ballooning to $1k+, with 84/90+ month loans being taken out to accomplish this. That tells me that many are living beyond their means rather than within them. <br>When vehicles are being looked at as an even longer-term purchase than ever before (the average age of a car in the US is over 12 years old, the highest it&#039;s ever been), your average shopper is thus going to be looking at a &quot;do everything&quot; vehicle rather than something that may be niche, a lifestyle vehicle, a &quot;personal&quot; car or whatever marketing term they&#039;re called in the 2020s. Thus, it pushes people away from coupes, and in lots of cases now, away from the few sedans still offered and into crossovers or SUVs. Will you have kids 5+ years from now? Will you live where it snows or floods? Maybe you&#039;ll pick up a new outdoorsy hobby? Probably no to all these things - but look at the marketing for any of these &quot;do everything&quot; vehicles and those are the usually what they&#039;ll depict.<br><br>Honda is literally about to release a new Prelude anyway, which, although people seethe at it having an NPC-tier hybrid powertrain, is a lot closer to what most actually need out of a commuter. I&#039;d rather see a sea of Prelude-like coupes instead of Rav4s and CR-Vs everywhere, personally.

Ford has been producing modular engines since the early 90s and 1996 was the first year of modular engine in Mustangs and they\u2019ve been modular ever since. It started with the 4.6 SOHC and DOHC which are usually referred to as the 2 valve and 4 valve. The pushrod 5.0 ceased production completely in 1995 and ford hasn\u2019t produced anything with a pushrod design ever since. <br><br>My 13 GT is the 5.0 DOHC v8 code named the Coyote that came out in 2011. Over 400hp at the wheel and the car barely weighs 3600lbs. It\u2019s a lot of fun and revs to 8000 after the recent tune. This set up with a tire and e85 could break into 10.9s in the right conditions. <br><br>Not insulting you. Just letting you know. @808Mtz on TikTok. Plenty videos of the car.",

The E46 is much more gorgeous than the E92, only problem I had though is, to be truthfully honest, the E30, E36, and E46 are just slow, which is expected from their era, but they don&#039;t even really feel quick. They&#039;re just essentially upbadged WRXs that are more pretty. They&#039;re more for car enthusiasts and collectors then for guys who love fast, muscly cars and revhappy cars like me. I&#039;m not the type of guy who likes to modify my car, like even if my steering wheel is peeling, it&#039;ll take a lot of justification for me to even replace it because I truly value stock. So the E92, just because it has the speed and is more fun on a track. The E46 is a classic always though.<br><br><a href=\"#p28529207\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28529207</a><br>Think a V8 that is just revhappy as fuck, quick as fuck, makes its presence known, has amazing styling on the exterior, and is super comfortable and quiet on the interior, but is a fucking absolute blast to drive and corners like a beast, and can get loose if you ever want it to.

The air suspension may leak at around 100k-150k miles, which is a known and unfortunate problem, but, they\u2019re rock solid beyond that once replaced. Theres no reason to put some crazy track focused suspension on it, when I can just switch to it at the push of a button. The M5 lacks presence. It literally just looks like another basic car on the road, and the designing just never ages well and it has a terrible reputation. The E63 wagon, any year, is peak sedan/wagon design that looks handsome, but aggressive. It is far from gaudy on the interior, it is literally one of the most understated but classy and luxurious interiors ever. Also, the 335i is literally the honda civic of our times. I don\u2019t care you put giant turbos with an annoying ass blow off valve in it, a shit car is still a shit car in the end. But it\u2019s your shit car, so respect.<br><br><a href=\"#p28529351\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28529351</a><br>Just a boring car. The M3 is way better.

And then when you finally nail down a price for both, you get sent to the finance nigger who&#039;s trying to sell you warranties at +200% markup because of COURSE he gets a cut as well, whether you came in with your own financing or not you now have to haggle with this turbojew as well.<br>So fucking annoying. I&#039;m shopping for a specific model car as well right now and just don&#039;t want to deal with it. I see a &quot;deal&quot; for $26k, 66k miles at a local dealer. They&#039;ve lowered it by $2k since it&#039;s been on their lot for a month. What does this mean? It just means they&#039;re going to try and jew me on the trade in even harder or have hidden addons as we discuss price and then I&#039;ve wasted hours talking to this retard. They&#039;re not going to let you get it inspected at a mechanic so you&#039;re still taking that risk you&#039;re buying something with minor problems...because the other big dealer near me is explicitly known for selling cars with problems and then when the customer complains, they take it back (minus documentation fees ~$1000) and just sell it to the next sucker and hope they don&#039;t notice. All of this has me coming extremely close to just buying from Carmax. It&#039;s a little more but there won&#039;t be any haggling on trade-in or price, I can get it inspected, 10-day buyback period no questions asked and if you buy their extended warranty it actually covers shit unlike assurant.<br>fuck dealerships. such an outdated stupid fucking model. I don&#039;t do this dog and pony show at gamestop or anytime I&#039;m literally buying anything else in the world.",

Was getting wind noise in my car at 40+ mph, they had it for a few days and told me they couldn&#039;t replicate the issue. I went on identifix and printed out a tsb describing the exact issue I was having, and when I went to go get my car I immediately spoke to the service manager where we had a pissing contest accusing each other that we&#039;re full of shit. He got mad and insisted we went on a test drive, 5 minutes into the drive on the freeway it was as loud as could be. His attitude did a complete 180 and he was embarrassed, trying to hurry back to the dealership. Got my car back a few days later and they actually made the problem worse, brought it back in again and that time they actually fixed it. Which is funny, because they only had one more opportunity to fix it after that before I could legally lemon law the car.",

        "com": "I have bought 4 new cars with leases and loans from 4 different manufacturers and they&#039;re all shit. Though, some are worse than others.<br>Here&#039;s my list from best to worst.<br>1. Honda (24 Honda Prologue)<br>I went with the wife to get a car for her, but still a compromise. She wanted an hr-v, I wanted her to have a Prologue because EV rebates and sickass lease deals. Drive the CR-V hybrid while we&#039;re there. Sales guy does the usual vetting of &quot;what do you do for a living&quot; in the car and shit. But he&#039;s pretty chill. We talk it over and leave to weigh up options. Cool. Come back for the Prologue and they have it marked down $13k, with the lease incentive already in. Finance guy jokes about how much of a steal it was as we&#039;re talking numbers. Was a pretty chill experience.<br>2. Lexus<br>I impulse leased an IS350. Walked into the dealer, test drove it, loved it, did the paperwork on Dec 31, 2021. Dude was chill, but was ready to leave. Paperwork took ages. The sales manager came out and we shot the shit about planes. Nice, but heartless. Service lane was cool, but 2hrs away.<br>3. Toyota<br>Before I bought the Hyundai (more on that in a bit), I looked at a Tacoma in Feb of 2020. I kick myself for not buying it, but boy that was a piece of shit. I think it was some terrible spec, it was dogshit. The lady was nice enough and I walked away. March of 24 comes around and we&#039;re needing a truck. I end up taking the wife and leasing a Tundra. It&#039;s pretty nice, way nicer than the tacos at the time (pre redesign). Engine issues already sorted out, SR-5 optioned out pretty well. Again, more boring paperwork (why does it take 2 hours to put deals together, ffs?). Nothing remarkable, but nothing I was wowed over either.<br>4. Hyundai<br>Far and away the worst. Full sales theater. Sales manager yelling about trying to save us money. Service lane tried to tell us we needed an alignment by handing us an alignment result from not our car. Unreal, never again.",

When you go to test drive start the engine let it idle and put it into 4th gear then dump the clutch, if the engine doesn&#039;t stall and jerk to a stop immediately the clutch is fried. Check for goo under the motor mounts, they come fluid filled stock and when they are shot the fluid leaks out underneath them. Try and avoid any of them that have been screwed with by fuckboys, ir avoid highly modified ones since most people go for the cheapo cobb tunes and those have been known to cause damage over time to some engines. Beyond that upgrade all the stuff I listed in <a href=\"#p28525091\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28525091</a> and add on exhaust + charge piping. If you wanna go full balls to the wall get a meth injection kit and the aluminum intake manifold from mountune and remove the old manifold then clean your valves/intake ports then the meth injection will keep them clean from then on. Otherwise be prepared to clean them with plastic picks and chemicals every 70k or so.",

The Recaros are probably great if you\u2019re conefagging but for day to day stuff I think they\u2019re going to get old fast, even if you\u2019re like 120 pounds.

You can&#039;t just scan part-print part and will never be able to (not like most people are running around with , you have to reverse engineer it and then take material properties and printing specifics into account when designing a printable version. Sometimes it&#039;s as easy as &quot;make it extra thick&quot;, but cars have many places that are dimensionally constrained. There aren&#039;t many actual engineers with free time running around, much less ones that are willing to share their efforts for free.<br>Another problem is that there isn&#039;t really a good repository to share these parts. There&#039;s like a dozen 3D printing sites and they all suck for the task at hand, particularly for categorizing parts. If there was an automotive-specific site with a Rockauto-like catalog, something might&#039;ve taken off, but so far most people either keep what they design to themselves or dump it onto Thingiverse where it gets lost among the sea of articulated dragons and DnD dice with mildly different fonts.",

I don&#039;t know these trucks but I assume both blinkers are on a common relay so if one works that means the relay should be alright. If there is continuity at the stalk when switched and the bulb is live, then you could try running a new wire to another relay spliced off the original blinker relay, or a new run to the original, but I feel like problem is through the stalk to the internals of that steering wiring cluster.. on 90s gear that is pretty old now.

When I got it the wipers wouldnt turn off which turned out to be the multifunction switch was just filled with goop basically and the wiper switch had been gummed up in the ON position. The door locks also stopped working which was just corroded contacts and the speedometer comes in and out which was just a old sensor on the diff. Overall Im not at all gonna give up infact Im basically doubling down as this is my new daily. I just really wanna figure this out so I can stop cutting people off and not run the risk of getting pulled over for something stupid. I appreciate your input, Im gonna probably try inspecting the wires but Id think if there was an issue with the connection Id be able to see it in all the times Ive taken the shroud off the steering column but who knows maybe Im blind.

Check front suspension too, boots and struts are probably OE. Open all the doors, make sure all the power windows work, turn on the a/c to cold, then check the heat. Turn the radio on. Check how crappy the headliner and A pillars are. Remove floor mats and run hand under where each mat was, check for wet or dampness or signs of it. <br>Can&#039;t check without removing, but I bet both front and rear air intake boots are split on the bottom and you won&#039;t see this till you change the air filter. Check all rubber and hoses while in the engine bay. Start car, listen for ticks, bad pulleys or squeels, etc. Inspect belt and hoses before starting car. Open trunk, make sure tools are in the BMW tool box. Inspect weatherstripping. Open glove box, make sure BMW flash light still there. Go for test drive, get it up to temp, get on the freeway, open it up a bit. Check for vibrations, and at what speed or grinding from rear end. Brake hard, see if it pulls left or right or shakes. Go back, park, get flash light, go look under front of car under engine now that it&#039;s been driven, see how many oil leaks drop or coolant. That car has a dipstick, check the oil.",

Carrier bearing rumble will also go damn near forever since the rotational speed is low but it is causing metal contamination of the fluid which will eventually affect the pinion bearings and cause them to start howling. The rotational speeds of these will be in the 3-4K rpm range on most cars so they can tear themselves up quickly. As they do they develop free play which then allows the pinion seal to leak . Eventually you&#039;ll run out of fluid and burn the thing up leaving you stranded somewhere inconvenient at best. That said, keep the fluid up with weekly, and then daily, checks. When that gets out of hand you&#039;ll know you&#039;ve finally gotta make a choice.",

There is a booming effect you get with such a large cabin like in a very roomy wagon or SUV over rough road that doesn&#039;t typically transmit through the chassis as well into a sedan&#039;s cabin. This bank vault, luxury feel is taken to its logical extreme in cars like the Lexus LS460 which doesn&#039;t have a folding rear seat for an even lower noise floor by isolation the occupants from the trunk even more.",

While the wheelbase is mostly the same or just a tiny bit longer, the fifth wheel has to sit further back to accommodate for the longer cab, and that immediately rules out pulling the longer trailers because it goes over the length limit at that point. On the other hand I can see a longer cab work in the american market though, but at that point without the stricter length limit you can also make them long nosed trucks like the rest of the US, just with the same features we already have.",

Off the top of my head, licenses and permits are more expensive here, which some companies do cover the cost of for their drivers, and our general worker&#039;s rights make it more attractive to work under contract than if you were on your own dealing with everything by yourself, so being self employed is a bit pointless. Also I&#039;d say that the daily driving limits might play a part, here generally you can only drive 9 hours/day with occasional 1 hour extensions, when in the US I think it&#039;s an 11 hour limit, but I&#039;m not 100% sure, maybe a burger can chime in on that.",

Fortunately it got rear ended by some 90 year old lady that had no business being on the road and I got $5k out of the loss which was pretty much a gift from god, but I was looking at other means of getting rid of it.<br>Find a street nearby that has a lot of tractor trailers driving through, and park off the curb. At 3:00 in the morning some tweaked out third worlder looking at his CAD is going to plow right into it.<br>Another option is to take it camping out into the mountains and let it roll down a hill, but this is riskier and gives the claims agent a better opportunity to poke around the vehicle. One of my troops in the military did this and got away with it because his coverage was good and he was so far out in the woods that the claims guy didn&#039;t want to go out.<br>Do NOT do anything involving fire. Arson is stupid easy to detect and the suspicion of it will cause more problems.

Good cleaner and good sprayers, I found them much better to use than the shit in a can. As an added bonus you can spray shit with it and set it on fire for fun. We used to use them as little flamethrowers like kids do with deodorant cans but you have to keep a rag in your other hand as well as the cigarette lighter so you can put the flame out since as soon as you stop spraying it goes up to the bottle. I wouldn&#039;t trust some of you retards on here to do it and not kill yourselves but it was good fun.<br><a href=\"#p28528359\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;28528359</a><br>The ones you use for brake cleaner are different you fucking spastic.",

        "com": "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;When it was launched back in 1997, the 3.0 V6 Xantia Exclusive became the most powerful car in the Xantia line-up. Thanks to its 2946cc engine, the V6 can muster 194BHP at 5,500rpm and a whopping 197 lb/ft of torque at just 4,000rpm. That&#039;s enough to give it a 0-60mph time of 8.3 seconds, as well as a 140mph top speed. One of the most technologically advanced features of the Xantia is its Auto Adaptive gearbox which adapts to each driver&#039;s style. It also takes into account vehicle loading, engine information and even the current road characteristics before deciding which of a series of 12 shift patterns to use. The driver can then customise things further by manually switching the box to either Normal, Sport, or Snow settings. That&#039;s not the only trick to the clever auto however. Unlike other less intelligent boxes, it can also simulate manual driving characteristics and can provide engine braking on overrun and down changes when braking, to ensure the car is always in the right gear.</span>",

As with all Xantias, the V6 Exclusive has an unconventional Hydractive computer controlled suspension set up that combines MacPherson struts up front and trailing arms at the rear with Citroen&#039;s gas cushioned spheres replacing more conventional shock absorbers. Externally the Xantia Exclusive can be distinguished by its unique 6Jx15 alloy wheels shod with 205/60 R15 tyres, deep chin spoiler with larger air intake, twin exhaust tail pipes and subtle V6 badging. Larger 283mm discs (front) and 224mm discs (rear) are also fitted to the V6 so it can cope with the extra power. </span><br><br>https://www.hagerty.co.uk/articles/<wbr>car-profiles/vita-activa-memories-o<wbr>f-a-performance-oddity/",

Obviously a manual utility vehicle is very different from a &quot;sports&quot; car. Trucks and other work vehicles are made to have most of their torque down low, and aren&#039;t really supposed to rev much higher than 2500/3000. Meanwhile with the car, you get the enjoyment of actually riding out the gear, as any fun car worth it&#039;s salt will get most of it&#039;s power up high close to 6500.",

An autotragic will coast at that car in top gear forcing you to brake. Every fucking day my my truck&#039;s autotragic retard box lugs it up a hill in the wrong gear then downshift to the correct gear to climb the hill at the very top of the hill then upshifts immidiately to the top gear as I then stand on the brakes to slow down for the rough rail crossing at the bottom of the hill. Every. Fucking. Day. With my manual car I could climb the hill in the correct gear then engine brake down the hill for the rough tracks. I won&#039;t even use cruise control with the truck because the autotragic will down shift then upshift a few seconds later for no reason. It&#039;s not just the truck either. Every autotragic I have driven does this. You&#039;re traveling down the interstate just fucking stay in top gear.",

Every driver who truly pays attention to his/her driving can see if you begin to slow down. it its fairly easy to notice if you are driving behind other car, if you know your current speed, if you first have been driving same or lower speed than the car in front you for longer time, then you suddenly approach/get closer the other car abnormally fast, like a 0.5-1.5 second faster than you estimated despite you not increasing your driving speed at all. Thats one way how you can sense that other car in front of you has slowed down despite brake lights or tail lights not turning on.",

While sedans/coupes can be styled and sexy in many ways, the only &quot;style&quot; that works on a CUV is &quot;rugged and tough&quot; because when you try to do anything else it quickly becomes apparent the CUV is just an egg shaped box of compromises.<br><br>Only affluent people can afford a coupe or a sedan because they are able to also own a truck. <br><br>Anyway, fuck crossovers and SUVs.",

I&#039;m gonna stick it out for the rest of this season and try to build as much experience as I can and then trade it in on something in the 750 range next spring.",

In hindsight fist stage was exciting because we weren&#039;t familiar with the formula yet and the audience was just being introduced to touge racing and it seemed cool and interesting sure, Takumi was already a great racer but, it still felt like he could lose at any moment especially when he raced Mako Sato. The series had such fucking shit character writing it was so dull and uninspired with the Iketani fumbling Mako and Takumi relationship with Natsuki, it was just really retarded and you could tell the publisher was like &quot;hey, this is a sienen magazine. Add some relationships and personal growth for your characters outside of racing&quot; and the guy either couldn&#039;t be assed or was just a shit character writer (I mean Takumi is a mary sue who wins every race, that&#039;s literally all there is to his character). Which brings me onto the last and perhaps most crucial point, Takumi never ever loses a single race, A big thing that made me like the show initially was him testing his limits and the chance that he could loose, it was kinda like watching a sports game but, that never happens because I&#039;m willing to bet that Takumi is just a shitty stand in OC the writer dreamt up because someone made fun of his clapped out corolla.<br><br>Oh and I hated when he joined project D, it just took out all of the feeling and emotion of the races. In Akina he was racing to defend the pride of the Akina racers from the redsuns, night kids etc but, in project D he basically becomes a Redsun and it&#039;s nowhere near as interesting to watch.",

Whatever, I&#039;ll bite.<br><br>4WD is used whenever the rear axle begins to lose traction. It is useful for icy / snowy roads, and on dirt roads or offroading in which having the front wheels driven as well helps the vehicle get more traction. Anytime you&#039;re on dry pavement, you should be in 2WD, and only engage 4WD if the rear can&#039;t get traction, or you expect it to slip.

You should use this for &quot;general purpose&quot; and any speed greater than approximately 25 mph, but can be used below that speed as well. 4WD Low engages a gear reduction (approximately 2:1) that limits your speed, but doubles your torque. It is useful for when you&#039;re trying to tow something in a difficult situation on loose terrain, or when you want more control over the transmission. <br><br>If it has hubs on the front axle (not sure if 1st gen Tundras did so this might not be applicable), you will need to turn them to the &quot;lock&quot; position before engaging 4WD. You should leave them in the &quot;free&quot; or &quot;unlocked&quot; position normally. <br><br>The &quot;1&quot; (sometimes &quot;L&quot;) and &quot;2&quot; (and sometimes &quot;3&quot;) positions on the transmission shifter are just gear lock outs that prevent the transmission from going to a higher gear. This is useful if you&#039;re towing something and don&#039;t want it to shift up to a higher gear, if you want to engine brake down a long hill, or if you&#039;re off roading and want to maintain your RPMs without the transmission trying to grab a higher gear. You will have it in drive &quot;D&quot; under all normal driving.",

They normally have a gearset in them that allows each tire to spin independently (for road use). When the locking differential is engaged, it forces the left and right tire (on the same axle) to turn at the same speed. This is useful in when one tire is not getting traction, as that tire will spin and no torque is delivered to the tire that does have traction (because of the gearset in the axle). When the locking differential is engaged, it forces the tire with traction to spin. This should only be used off road or otherwise in extremely slippery conditions, never on dry pavement. <br><br>You can engage 4WD at any time. It is best to engage at a full stop, but if you&#039;re driving in a straight line, you should be able to engage it as well. Note that if you have hubs (as mentioned before), you must turn them in prior to using it.",

Within the documentary they pointed out what was pretty obvious. That Guam as a whole had a problem with obesity. As they tried to admit the fat guy to the weight loss clinic it was obvious that all attempts would be in fucking vain, because even the staff at the &quot;weight loss clinic&quot; was morbidly obese LMAO",

Buy what you like/makes you happy, it&#039;s your money. Having a popular car (especially in the Miata&#039;s case) also means there&#039;s endless aftermarket parts support for it, any question you could have or DIY guide you might need to reference has already been posted online, and (for the most part) you can even get parts you need short notice from local auto parts stores. Yeah an imported MG F might be more unique and special (for example) but nobody is going to have parts for it and there will be little to no documentation online for it either. You&#039;re on your own.",

I would love to see anons post an W201 evo II or a W220 v12. I dont think I see many bimmers on here either, E30, E36 or E46. Just some schizo posting about their E39. Never seen a single anon post an Audi, whether it&#039;s a RS6 wagon, quattro, v8 or S2. Seen a single Porsche but it was probably not his but his dad&#039;s. Also contrary to what /o/ says about wrenching on old cars I&#039;ve never seen anyone post a 964, 930, 993 or a 944.<br>Never seen an anon post a Lotus on here.<br>Plenty of Americans though, so Mustangs, Corvettes, Camaro, a single Viper, Hellcat and a Charger. Never seen a CT-V Blackwing on here but I know someone who does from a spinoff 4chan thread place.<br>Never seen a single anon posting owning a Chinese car despite shills.<br>Seen a single Guilia owner and a Fiata owner. But forget about Italian sports cars with their constant breakdowns.<br>Idk what other makes / nations there are for sports cars.",

Toyotas are known for having early suspension problems, you will likely need to replace the struts or full suspension within 80k miles, my Rav4 struts blew out around 40k. They all have had very serious wiring problems from using cheap wires made of onions that degrade or get eaten by rats, this causes electronics to fail or headlights to become too dim with no solution other than to replace all the wiring. I won&#039;t buy any of their hybrids or CVTs ever again, reasons being their CVT in my Corolla was knocking and about to blow up at 60-80k miles. I unloaded the car onto someone else before it detonated but that thing was making some fucked up noises and not performing well, it would make a clunking noise at each start from a red light. Their hybrid warranty is also a sham, if you read the fine print you have to have the battery inspected every 20k miles or the warranty is void. Each inspection costs $200-400 depending on who owns the dealership you take it to. My hybrid battery shit the bed around 60-80k miles, wasn&#039;t holding charge or giving me good MPG anymore.<br><br>So I guess you can expect to own it for 5-7 years before it goes to shit if you drive the average of 12k miles a year. Both Toyotas I&#039;ve owned (Rav4 and Corolla hybrid) have shat out hard around 80k. I guess you could say the suspension issue is routine maintenance but they should last way longer, but the transmission, wiring, and battery issues are inexcusable.",

Zoom call, cop didnt show up, ticket dismissed.<br>If cop did show up, I would have pleaded guilty, explained that I was merely passing an RV in the passing lane that was ending, judge would have most likely reduced the fine to something like 10 over which would have been $90, and required me to take a 4 hour online safety driving course for $200.<br>no points on license, not reported to insurance, zero further consequences.<br><br>how the FLYING FUCK do you get a goddamn ticket for anything less than 10MPH over the limit?? what kind of fucked up shit is going on there? even the fucking speed cameras here in the US only trigger if you are going 6mph over the limit and you need to rack up 3 unpaid tickets that all go into collections before you lose your license.<br>even if you get 3 tickets from cameras and plead guilty and pay them all you still cant lose your license. only retards do that anyway, you can hire a lawyer for $500 to get that shit dismissed.<br>I ask again, what the FUCK is going on over there?",

Ask for them to send you a copy of a sales agreement with the out-the-door price. Never go into a dealership if they say shit like &quot;You have to come in for our best prices&quot; and other stupid shit. Have a price ready to go. Have financing ready to go, even if you&#039;re going to let them run your credit, and do your due dilligence and look up the history report of the vehicle. Never trust those fuckers, and never tell them that you&#039;re going to pay cash or this or that until you&#039;ve agreed on the sales price. They&#039;re not selling these things like hotcakces, so it&#039;s not like you&#039;re going to be at a disadvantage here. Just ask for a sales agreement, try to negotiate on the price beforehand, and only walk in once you have that price in hand. If they refuse to honor the original quote, then walk out. It&#039;s much better to waste gas money or a plane ticket than it is to be burdened with a car you&#039;re going to resent for costing you something it shouldn&#039;t have.",
