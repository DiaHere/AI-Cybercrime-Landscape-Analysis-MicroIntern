Like, once the novelty wears off, what else is there to do?<br>Anybody have any experience in doing muay thai in one place for a month or so? if so, where did you stay and did it get boring after a while?",

I like walking around aimlessly, discovering new places in cities, but Thailand, I&#039;ve found, is just too hot for that without having a few months to acclimatise first.

They&#039;re just bars really, but unlike typical open front beer bars you can&#039;t see inside from the street and they often have couches that can be curtained off. Some, such as the Telephone Bar (named after the red British phonebox outside), let you get your dick sucked while sitting at the bar. I&#039;ve heard of others with dick sucking at the bar but they&#039;re in Bangkok and I can&#039;t remember any names as I didn&#039;t go there much. They usually have a pretty ropey selection of girls too, those ones, at least going by the photos and reports I&#039;ve seen; I&#039;ve never been in one myself though to verify.<br><br>They&#039;re typically frequented by expats with a gf or wife back home who want to be naughty away from prying eyes, more than they are by 2 week millionaire tourists.<br><br>If you&#039;re in central Pattaya head for Soi Bongkot where there&#039;s a small strip of half a dozen of them; or there&#039;s Bar La Poste on Soi Lengkee; or Excite Club on Soi Excite, all fairly close to each other. The rest are mostly scattered over towards Pratumnak and Jomtien way, and you&#039;d really need a taxi to get to them. Can&#039;t help with Bangkok, it was never my scene.",

I know those are risks, but I&#039;d always be able to look back and think &quot;at least I had some marvelous dining experiences&quot;. At home you need to clean the sink, empty the trash, and make sure things are organized in the pantry. Traveling offers a different experience. Asia is like cooking with a pot and lid, while in America Instant Pot pressure cookers are the norm, or so it seems.

They will amplify the shit out of any feels you&#039;re currently experiencing, so it you&#039;re nervous and tense, whatever you&#039;re worried about will be blown up like a sexpat&#039;s cauliflower dick after rawdogging ladyboys for a fortnight in Pattaya. <br><br>The other issue with these mushroom shakes and teas, is you have absolutely no way of dosing them yourself. You have no fucking clue how much psilocybin is in that shit and could end up necking what amounts to a &quot;heroic&quot; dose for someone in experienced. People have ended up in the psyche ward from taking too much.<br><br>Finally, if you have any history of schizophrenia or biopolar in your family, at all, think very careful about whether you want to risk setting off anything latent, like those poor fuckers who turn schizo just from smoking a joint; it&#039;s the same with psychedelics if you&#039;re one of the unlucky ones. Very, very low in occurrence but it does happen.<br><br>I would wait til I&#039;m back home and score something off the darknet.",

The longer you spend in school the more doors you close. When I was going through grad application process one of my professors sat me down and actually talked me through this as well. Yes a PhD or Masters will get you potential access to niche job markets but they are small and highly competitive. The reality is people will look at your degrees and toss your resume aside because they will expect you want to be paid a lot or too qualified (unironically). If you actually want a job you need experience which means interning and starting early. Also Grad school is not cheap, it&#039;s fucking expensive and PhD is probably a nightmare without grants/scholarships or paid for by an employer.",

For example you have relatively easy access to the US, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean / Central America, which I would love to visit, but are still prohibitively expensive for me. The only time I went to the US myself was on a work trip, so I had most of my expenses paid. Also, alas the golden age of when us euros could hop on a flight and visit another euro capital for a weekend like 60\u20ac are long gone, flight prices have gone up a lot even for short-haul flights so even relatively &quot;easy&quot; trips are getting more and more expensive (that&#039;s not even mentioning the fact that european capitals, at least western ones, are hideously overpriced, especially when it comes to hotels / BnBs)<br><a href=\"#p2788957\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2788957</a><br>I did like it a lot, but it&#039;s definitely not a trip I would recommend to everyone. I went in the winter, which meant no hiking or other very outdoorsy stuff, but the rugged snowy landscapes and the ancient monasteries covered in snow were a true sight to behold. However, apart from churches and mountains there is not much else the country has to offer (also Georgia next door has better mountains or so I&#039;ve been told). The food is great but not exceptional, Yerevan is cool and interesting but not mindblowing, you get the point. If you want a cheap trip in a country with a lot of interesting history, landscapes and architecture, that still has a relatively underdeveloped tourism industry (we had to improvise a lot, fortunately it&#039;s very easy to find taxis and tours at convenient prices) and is relatively off the beaten path (most tourists I saw when I went were from places like India or the Philippines), then yeah, I would say Armenia is a good option. My personal highlight for the trip was the Byurakan observatory, picrel. If you have other questions feel free to ask",

Lhasa filled with concrete tower blocks like every other Chinese city, giant highways, no sign of restrictions being loosened up a bit, and very few foreign tourists.<br><br>one funny anecdote is that the police have fitted average speed check cameras on the highway that note when you enter a certain section of road and note when you exit, then calculate if your average speed was higher than the limit and fine you accordingly. In response to this, their driver simply took his 4x4 off the road and drove around the cameras at the exit. Other people stopped their cars on the road just before the cameras and waited so their average speed would go down.<br><br>I&#039;ve also heard there&#039;s a lot of brain drain from there to Chengdu and Sichuan, because universities and higher education is very underdeveloped.<br><br>as a HK citizen could you visit without a permit?",

        "com": "Hello, Norwegian map autist here. Sorry for the radio silence, I was planning to update the map around New Year&#039;s, but because a lot of people at work was sick, I&#039;ve been busy with working a lot of extra shifts for half a year now and it&#039;s taken all my energy. Things have improved lately, people are coming back to work and they&#039;ve hired a few more people, so I&#039;m back to my old schedule. This has allowed me to finally work on the new update. These are the changes I found:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;BIOT will join Mauritius</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;there&#039;s a new region in the Philippines, so I might redraw the map to its provinces instead, lots of smaller and less visited countries have their complete set represented on the map. At the very least I&#039;ll make a DLC out of it.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;there are new regions in Mali and Angola</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;some regional borders in Iraq, Latvia and the Republic of the Congo has changed</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;regional reforms in Burundi and Vietnam will reduce the number of regions, these are approved and will be implemented this year, I&#039;m only waiting on an updated map so I can redraw them</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;will add Martim Vaz to Brazil since an Anon requested it</span><br><br>If anyone knows other changes or has suggestions, please share them. This map is a group effort, and we can only improve it if people reaches out with their ideas.<br><br>Question for smart people: Are Ireland&#039;s counties correctly represented on the map? It looks like it&#039;s missing five city counties, but these aren&#039;t new additions, so I&#039;m wondering if I&#039;ve left them out in earlier updates for a reason and just forgot.<br><br>Anyway, here&#039;s my map. Since last time I posted I&#039;ve visited Rome. I&#039;ve already been to Italy (Sardinia) years ago, but I visited the Vatican City for the first time, and also the offices of the Order of Malta, which I count as a &quot;country&quot;. My current tally is now at 38 countries, 33 UN members and five &quot;others&quot;.",

I sound like a spoiled cunt saying it, but most of the time I just wanted to go home because I really don&#039;t care about my heritage, and my parents were miserable fucks anyway so it&#039;s not like they made the trips easy to enjoy.<br>That being said, I&#039;ve always wanted to do a tour of the 13 colonies, but just because it&#039;s a simple categorisation), and I worked part-time all through high school and university as well as doing internships/a placement year, so I can afford to do it when I graduate next summer without going into crippling debt or being faced with permanent unemployment like most Londoners these days. I&#039;m not exclusively into Revolution history, but the colonies are a include all the states I&#039;ve always wanted to visit, be it due to their history or just aesthetic/baseless personal passion. I know that I&#039;m missing regions that are part of newer states rather than the original colonies, but it is what it is. American footballs my main sport so it&#039;s a shame that I won&#039;t be able to watch any NFL/CFB games, but I&#039;ll catch an NBA/MLB game every time I&#039;m in a city with a team since I&#039;m a casual fan of those sports too. Don&#039;t have any friends so I&#039;ll be going solo, and I doubt I&#039;ll be making any when I&#039;m there so I&#039;m not too worried about the social aspect of tourism. Pretty much the only thing I&#039;m undecided on is whether to start in the North or South.<br>I only want to &quot;visit&quot; Australia because I&#039;m hoping to move there a couple years down the line. Sorry for the blogpost, but typing this out made me realise just how much of a bore I am, so really I&#039;m the victim here",

Think will go to Nagano because I don&#039;t really want to go all the way to Hokkaido, though I heard there&#039;s some places in Shimane for skiing. I doubt they would care about going to Kyoto, just want to fuck around and do gen z tourist shit probably, but I want to go back to Nagasaki and Nagoya, as well Hiroshima, Shikoku and Fukuoka. But I also want to see snow so maybe going up Tohoku would be nice. This is the fourth time I&#039;m going and I don&#039;t want to be a loser like last time when I spent most of my day trying to use dating apps and getting rejected then wandering the streets at night and accomplishing nothing. <br>Also want to see train stuff, like find every train in the country, ride more obscure trains and do limited expresses instead of Shinkansen everywhere. I really enjoyed taking the Hinotori from Osaka to Nagoya. Shinkansen is still peak comfy though, especially at night.",

I&#039;m curious how long i should stay in each city and suggestions on where to stay in each. I dont have any real ideas on what i want to see when im there. The only thing i do know i want to see is Tokyo sea life park, maybe the ghibli museum if i can get tickets, and then a day probably walking around akihabara. <br><br>My biggest issues is i hate planning have no idea where to stay though chatGPT suggested THE GATE HOTEL ASAKUSA KAMINARIMON which does look nice especially for the price but wondering if i should pay more to stay in shinjuku or shibuya, or maybe move hotels? It would be nice to stay in a ryoken for a night, Yama No Chaya was suggested by GPT and it looks nice if maybe a little pricey, would stay there on the way to kyoto. Besides tokyo and kyoto i may go to osaka as well but not sure besides that. Any trips for places to go / stay / see while im there would be greatly appreciated. Ive heard from friends that went recently to just get a suica card and load it as needed and then pay for shinkansesn as needed.<br><br>Any general suggestions or recommendations would be appreciated. I pretty much hate traveling but need to visit japan so i dont mind spending whats needed to get the full experience as i might not travel again unless this unlocks that desire in me",

If she was an expat (which is doubtful because she doesn&#039;t even look old enough to drink), again, why would she be doing this job? <br>Maybe she&#039;s a 2nd gen of expats but her vibes are SO american college, &quot;ugg boots and pumpkin spice&quot; - down to the fashion - that I can&#039;t believe she&#039;d be able to capture the aesthetic that soundly without having very recently lived it.

Also, this remaining demographic seems to be the caliber of people who are (clinically diagnosable) narcissists, which is a cluster B bonafide mental disease. the entire culture and average filipino is a rude, entitled, swindling piece of shit now and that&#039;s putting it nicely.",

It is impossible to distinguish the really bad actors from the bad actors. They&#039;re all swapping notes about how to get the most from foreigners (as well as fellow Filipinos alike; they&#039;re not just doing these things to foreigners), and it has turned into a game of one-upsmanship between the girls to say how they got the most for doing the least. This is like western women going to a bar to see how many free drinks they can get.<br><br>Man-hate and feminism are FULL BORE now. I have videos of malls with huge displays up so that even the lowest IQ Filipinos can understand that women are being glorified.<br><br>I also have a video I took of a girl&#039;s phone of just how many men women are messaging and what men are saying to them if anyone is interested in seeing it. A lot of men are simply genuinely seeking an emotional connection to a woman, however the women are happy to send you a few terse messages, letting you believe she&#039;s listening, then these dummies start sending her money for free. Some guys are offering thousands of dollars to travel for a month with her; sometimes it&#039;s multiple guys traveling with the same woman (this is disgusting, but it&#039;s happening). One big theme is that men seem to think because a woman is talking nicely to them that they&#039;re the only one talking to her - NOT THE CASE. The girl I am talking about was sleeping with 3-5 different men per day, and guys were treating her like she was some pure hearted gift.I will post this video eventually.<br><br>the girls are all on birth control",

NOT the case. I thought women&#039;s innate destructive tendencies were implied, however I will explicitly state it here to ensure avoidance of false notions coming about. <br><br>Some examples of the power exertions they&#039;re doing:<br>- These days, Filipinas join the bar at 18 fully intending to &quot;take over&quot; the establishment. You can imagine how this might work behind the scenes with the other girls, but what you might be surprised about is their flagrant, emotionally-charged passive aggressiveness towards customers. They will start conspiring against the owners &amp; managers to avoid going with customers to socially punish someone for whatever arbitrary nonsense their female brain comes up with<br>- They are talking smack to you straight away on the street trying to tell YOU what&#039;s going to happen and how much you will pay. Again, if a girl has a bad attitude or is in a bad or flat mood? SKIIIIIIIIIIP. Do not take that girl and cease all interaction. She will continue to be a bitch<br>- Girls will tell YOU that if they stay with you for 4 days, for example, they are your girlfriend<br>- They are straight up reneging on agreements made in the bar, sometimes with the manager, sometimes without. Either way, if you go back to complain they&#039;ll tell you to go fuck yourself because it&#039;s 2025 and it&#039;s their choice and they will not refund your money. They can run off as soon as you walk out the door and you&#039;re fucked<br>- Make no mistake about it, these girls are now IN COMPETITION WITH *YOU*. They think that they&#039;re going to be more rich and powerful than the tourist who come in with pockets full of cash... they&#039;re immediately envious that you&#039;re on the other side of the transaction.

This is *not* true, and before the All Police come here, the exception is not the rule. There has not been an abundent amount, nor generally accepting pool of girls, at the mall to approach for a long time.

Most places you go are like the USA now where there are so few people out that there is no chance of something spontaneous happening or meeting new people with any sort of regularity; they&#039;re all sitting inside on their phones ordering food to their door with the extra money that retards gave them for tips or sent them electronically or overpaid them with.

The issues mentioned in my posts here explain a bit about why since the culture has tanked hard. *All* of my American friends are entertaining the idea of moving back to America, even the ones with businesses there.",

Which brings me to my next point about why crime/scams &amp; general exploitative tourist culture is so high right now; there is always a new sucker to take the place of someone who won&#039;t be a return customer. First of all, people around the world have been hearing that they can come to the Philippines &amp; simply dominate with their money. Well, no. It&#039;s a seller&#039;s market in the Philippines now &amp; Filipinos have no compunction about stealing or ripping off foreigners. There are people constantly getting drugged and robbed IN THE DISCOS!! Forget the number getting drugged in their hotel rooms or elsewhere - they&#039;re drugging you in a public place with lots of people &amp; robbing you there. This particular situation happened at least 5 times in the 4 months I was visiting. Pretty much every establishment will try to rip you off at some point. If you go to a restaurant they&#039;ll run a number of scams to try &amp; steal your money. One that I saw a lot was the staff taking 20+ minutes to bring you your change; they know a certain number of tourists are in a rush or will forget about it, and they&#039;ll keep your $10-15 in change. I waited 35 minutes one time for them to bring me my change and 40 minutes on another occasion; 20 minutes was common though. If you go to a restaurant with locals, they&#039;ll order food in Tagalog without approving it with you, and they&#039;ll bring $40+ worth of food to the table all at once and the Filipinos will refuse to pay &amp; they&#039;ll say that you have to pay or they&#039;re calling the police on you.",

Before anyone asks, I have no idea why everyone is outright refusing to treat STDs, but it&#039;s happening just as I say. Also the &quot;hygene tests&quot; are being faked and I hear both of the following assertions in equally belligerently confident ways: <br>1. the hygene test tests for disease and then treats any diseases. <br>2. the hygene test doesn&#039;t test for diseases, it just tests for cleanliness and no treatment is ever required, they just inform the girl &amp; her boss<br><br>Mental diseases are *everywhere*. <br>- Borderline personality disorder (BPD).

Some people say that women enjoy being night workers. however, what appears to be happening is the mamasans predatorily come after girls in ways that break their minds and induce some of the aforementioned mental diseases. What happens then is the girls are permanently broken mentally &amp; emotionally &amp; they use sex as a short-term coping mechanism for validation and attention (not a good system but it puts a bandaid on the pain and keeps them whoring). Then when they hit 24-25 years old the mamasans push them out before the resentment about what happened to them circles back around to bite them. We see this in the west when women get to age ~30 &amp; the attention from men dries up. IT&#039;S VERY IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT KNOWING THESE WOMEN ARE VICTIMS DOESN&#039;T FIX THEM AND THEY&#039;RE STILL A BURDEN WITH THEIR MENTAL ILLNESS TO EVERYONE AROUND THEM FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIFE. <br><br>Contrary to popular belief, these mental diseases absolutely can be contagious to you if you spend long enough around these people &amp; in intense enough situations. Also, the Philippines has no way of dealing with mental disorders so these people are allowed to run rampant everywhere and cause unlimited amounts of damage &amp; they do leave a trail of destruction &amp; influence those around them to act similarly, hence the air of fear and distrust in the air all over the Philippines.<br><br>This trip forced me to see exactly HOW what we call &quot;sexual liberation&quot; in the west comes full circle back to why people need to get married and stick with whoever they marry, for better or worse. Just get rid of this dating nonsense and be done with it for life. this explains why mental illness used to be noticed more easily and something was done about it; now nearly all women are broken and people take it as normal.",

Look up the suppresion of brain growth due to persistent cortisol release during childhood due to stress; once the damage is done it&#039;s permanent; this is found in almost all people with BPD. <br><br>again, the mothers do the damage at an early age so that the child never knows what&#039;s driving their behavior at an older age. this is why when people say &quot;she&#039;s a &#039;working&#039; girl because she wants to be&quot;, it&#039;s not entirely true. however, these women ARE permanently damaged&amp;will forever be a burden to society, even if you acknowledge that they were victims - so giving them victim status does nothing. plus on top of all this, women will leave a trail of destruction in their path while &quot;choosing&quot; to be a &quot;working&quot; girl. furthermore, the status quo of the modus operandi in the philippines right now is 100% tugging on men&#039;s heart strings&amp;trying to trap&amp;attack men emotionally&amp;unfortunately it&#039;s the most well-meaning men that are getting taken advantage of",

The problem isn&#039;t so much the unit, but the care of it. Same thing with a place in Makati although this one is way worse.<br>The building can seem ok, the unit is ok when you first walk in, but when you start opening cabinets, doors, or look closely, you see cockroach shit everywhere. They&#039;re not taken care of. That is actions of the people. It&#039;s not my fucking budget.

A long line of failures from multiple leadership, Cedar being the latest and the recent unannounced removals just was the breaking point building up.

If you&#039;re alone you have the awkward &quot;look at that manchild riding small world by himself&quot; problem.

I was 9 at the time and I figured that had to be the best ride ever for people who to wait in the Atlanta sun for that. Was shocked when I actually rode it a few years later.",

So the space Luigi\u2019s mansion could\u2019ve used was shrunk down to give room to potentially another coaster. We\u2019ve seen Hollywood and Florida shifted their direction to getting a massive and unique coaster before getting anything else, and at the expanse of other park areas (the tours, the citywalk, old attractions). With Epic Universe being the biggest park, they would desire making another big ride for it to keep its momentum.<br>Two, Luigi\u2019s Mansion was a ride type and direction Universal was no longer in favor of because of its complications and issues in Minion Blast. Which was a rough simplified model of Luigi\u2019s mansion. It being an overcomplicated screen ride could cause it be scrapped entirely like what happened with the potter VR attraction.<br>Three, would be the issues of capacity Universal is constantly having with its Omni-mover rides (Pets, Yoshi) and Mario Kart. And they would rather have a SNW attraction that is above 1200 people per hour for once.",

Not only is it an opening day attraction which makes it untouchable, it above the submarines and the ride most interlooped with the monorail track.

I hope the Universal land is this concept but with different biomes and a sort of catching mechanic with a purchasable bluetooth pokeball that functions similar to the Harry Potter wands 2.0 and interfaces with the app. Animatronic outdoor Pok\u00e9mon similar to the SNW Mario enemies are combined with static figures and screen based &quot;encounter&quot; spaces where you can RNG encounter, battle, and catch different mons. The majority of the land should be different routes as a sort of walk through area that encouraged exploration with areas resembling a cave, forest, desert, ocean, city, etc. The pokemon you catch can be brought out on the ride with you and used for whatever interactive component that&#039;s similar to Pok\u00e9mon snap. It would print so much fucking money. The sky is the limit really. People could bring their caught mons into the stores and get customized plushies of those mons. You could interface the app with pokemon home so you could take the pokemon into the games. So much fucking money is just there for the taking. <br><br><a href=\"#p2805021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2805021</a><br>He returns.",

There are 3 types of Vietnamese men, the most plentiful are absolute simps that spoil girls with money and gifts, then ghetto poor boys with mullets, sandals, and blonde hair but attract the hottest woman, and the wealthy ones who through nepotism or corruption got their money and run through all the hot girls before marrying someone their family approves of.<br><br>Vietnamese woman end up marrying the first type since the wealthy guys don&#039;t take them seriously and their families won&#039;t approve of the ghetto guy, and the simp guys are embarrassingly so, to the point Vietnam is actually a matriarchy. Divorce is skyrocketing lately as these damaged woman abandon their families.<br><br>That said if you want to try your chances anyways, you need either looks or money, preferably both. Once either is accomplished, hot viet girl pussy will flow almost as easily as anywhere else, but your reward in the end will usually be a vapid girl with nothing work talking to about, 0 intellectual curiosity, but if sex is the goal it&#039;s worth it since these girls will be actual whores for you and have amazing sex compared to the working girls who scream with fake moans and watch the clock. <br><br>If you want a traditional viet conservative girl to marry, that is much more difficult now. as the major cities like Hanoi, HCM, are getting infected with western disease, and the conservative areas, the families and general population actively discourage race mixing. Though I did recently score a virgin18 year old who just graduated high school from a conservative area, and though she had an army of simps, she admitted they made her feel quite bored, if she behaves well may impregnate her as I&#039;m not getting any younger<br><br>Anyways, yeah it is much harder than it was pre-covid, but beats dating in the US anyday, pic related is a married woman, their bodies always bounce back after having a kid.",

I pride myself on being an honest man, I&#039;d rather not talk at all than tell a lie. In my relationships with women I never lied nor I cared to lie, though I sometimes did not tell the whole truth.<br><br>I am aware that human courtship is a game of deception, I&#039;ve got sour grapes from years of engaging with all of this. Man, Women will tell ludicrous lies about themselves and they will see nothing wrong with it. What&#039;s worse, lying works for them, it works brilliantly. <br><br>It made me bitter, so lately I&#039;ve been faltering in my own convictions. For example, one of my fears is that I am 31 now and by the time I plant myself in SEA I&#039;ll be 32, but I want a young wife. So now what? <br>I spent too much time already thinking about simply lying about it, as due to being fit I could easily pass as 25-27. For women, at least western women. These few years apparently matter a lot, and it came to the point that now all the age gap relationships that are available to me are trailer trash women that require saving, and if you grew up around these you&#039;ll know that they rarely are worth it. Its easier to sex them, than to date them. I realize that my own living experience influences my opinion on this but its really grim to me. <br><br>Maybe I am blogposting because I am closer to giving up on this than I&#039;d think.<br>What is your opinion on this anon?

Poland definitely has cheaper and better food.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Transport: $32</span><br>Slightly cheaper than Poland, but only because I failed to avail myself of the lower-priced regional rail services in Poland and always used PKP Intercity. Third class train travel in Lithuania meant cramming myself into a compartment with five other people, a dog and two adorable little girls on the three hour journey to Vilnius.

I&#039;ve spent the last 9 months learning Mandarin and want to stick to the populated areas where I can practice multiple times per day.",

Arrived at Ruifeng at 09:10 and then i had to wait almost an hour until the next train on the Pingxli line (one per hour, understandable, but it fucking sucks, maybe you can taxi this lil bit if you get caught out like me but i didn&#039;t look into it...) at 10:03, to get to Shifen at 10:30~<br><br>- main attraction of Shifen is the street with the train line running through where lots of Koreans (and other tourists) buy lanterns from the souvenir stores lining the street to release into the air. Sometimes the train comes through and people clear out of the way and you can get some nice photos of that. buy a lantern, write your wish and release it if you want (i have never done it). There is some well known local street food sold here too which is rice stuffed into a chicken that is nice. Shifen also has a scenic waterfall nearby and its worth walking the 10 mins or so over to check it out since you came here<br><br>- at 12:33 I got on the train back up the Pingxi line to Houtong at 12:56 for a 1 hour stop. eh, cats. it has some free exhibitions on the local mining history (you can find small, free local history museums and exhibitions all over Taiwan. i went to many since i wasn&#039;t in a rush for time and i collect ink stamps that they usually have at these kind of places)",

I mean, FFS, all of my foreign language teachers in grade school and high school and college were originally native speakers of those foreign languages; my German teacher moved to the U.S. from Germany, my Spanish teacher moved to the U.S. from Argentina, my Russian teacher was a mail-order bride from some shithole village in Russia. I guess there was one exception; my German teacher died and the school had to bring in a long-term substitute for the rest of the year, who turned out to be a former student from our high school and who&#039;d studied under Mrs. Schultz.",

Schools are relaxed but kids care less about learning English than their counterparts in Taipei so keep that in mind. Rent is around 10-15k NTD for a good studio apartment depending on where you want to live. Having a kitchen will cost you a good bit more, possibly double. Most Taiwanese eat takeout and groceries are expensive so you would actually be saving money by just eating out. You can eat multiple meals a day for 1k NTD if you&#039;re not splurging. Also you will be discriminated against in renting as a foreigner. Don&#039;t take it personally. If you get a job teaching you&#039;ll get some assistance finding a place before you arrive though.",

I literally lived in Tamsui for ten years and there wasn&#039;t really a lot to do. You can go out to the north coast, which is nice, and is what I did a lot, but that&#039;s not &quot;Tamsui&quot;, you actually end up in other districts before you get to the beaches.<br><br>Shimen (the rock arch on the coast, not &quot;Ximen&quot; which is what Taiwanese always think foreigners are talking about) is a pretty little beach next to a fishing-boat harbor. I would avoid visiting on weekends because there&#039;s an obnoxious old lady who sells beach toys on weekends, and she brings a bicycle/clown horn that she honks every couple of minutes, which is annoying as fuck. HONKHONKHONK, wait a few minutes, HONKHONKHONK, lady will you fuck off I&#039;m trying to relax to the wave noise, HONKHONKHONK, welcome to Taiwan motherfucker this is what these cunts do, HONKHONKHONK.<br><br>Baishawan is a little bit before Shimen and is a larger and nicer beach, but I prefer Shimen because less people other than that annoying bitch.<br><br>You can take some of the 86X buses out to either beach, 865 or 863 or 862. Check the stops on the map (Google Maps sometimes will show you specific stops and bus numbers that stop at them, sometimes they disable it and it might not work on mobile) carefully because some of them make detours inland. Here, I did a screencap for you.<br><br>Also, there&#039;s an excellent Vietnamese restaurant along the coastal road, named Lan Phuong. They make an absolutely fantastic shredded chicken salad, it&#039;s shredded chicken plus shredded cabbage plus some sort of spicy-sour sauce. The pho is also good there. Unfortunately Google is being a bitch and refuses to find it, but it&#039;s on the interior (south) side of the coastal road and IIRC is about 4km before Shimen, almost exactly halfway between two bus stops (not a far walk but you WILL have to walk, or waddle).",

If you&#039;re an early riser you can do Palace Museum first, then go to CKS for 2-3 hours (it&#039;s a short visit but the spots are nice if you wanna take photos). By the afternoon the weather will get unbearable and that&#039;s when you can go to Beimen station and walk through the underground mall all the way to Taipei Main Station, where you can buy some weeb shit, get some cheap ice cream, and even some decent food. You can spend the evening in the ximen nightmarkets and then either call it a day or go for a disco nap, take a shower and go to one of them taipei 101 night clubs.<br><br>Day 2 (morning) : Wake up early (at least leave before 10am) and go to Gongguan. Go to Siyuan street and look for a &quot;Laya burger&quot; there. Just google it. From there, use Youbike 2.0, find a bike station (you&#039;re next to the NTU dorms so you WILL find a few stations around you), and take your ass down to the Gongguan riverside park. From there, It&#039;s a 30/40 minute ride to Xindian station. As you go south, the landscape will go from urban to having a few skycrapers in the middle of a mountainous jungle until you reach the Bitan scenic point. And since you&#039;re right next to the green line, you can get back to ximen and the city pretty quickly. Taipei is such a bike friendly city and it&#039;d be a shame not to enjoy this. there are a few nice restaurants down in Bitan, too. <br><br>Day 2 (afternoon) : This is where i would diverge with you heavily. Once you&#039;re done with Bitan on day 2, you could go straight to main station, take the train to keelung, go to Heping Island and be back on time for Keelung&#039;s night market to open. Why ?

Seriously, there is NOTHING to do in Keelung during the day, and Heping Island Park is more of a sight than an actual park like yangmingshan<br><br>Day 5 : like the other dude said, just turn Kaohsiung into a night trip and forget about Taichung. It&#039;s really not worth it, transportation thoroughly sucks, and you&#039;ve only got one city center that only ever wakes up at night. It&#039;s the night market.

I first went there with a pretty unrealistic view of what it was like, imagining it like a mini Japan that was both futuristic and traditional. In reality maybe I&#039;d say it&#039;s Chinese with Japanese characteristics. They do like to try take after Japan but it&#039;s still very Chinese. There&#039;s a lot less order to the cities than there is in Japan, for instance. It is dirtier, poorer and rougher around the edges. The weather and air quality is shit. It IS a lot more laid back than pretty much any other East Asian country/culture.<br>I haven&#039;t been to China in 10 years and I&#039;m not a seppo, but unless things have changed drastically I don&#039;t think you&#039;d have much problem there as an American but that&#039;s not outwardly obvious. My experience was that people loved approaching me if they weren&#039;t too busy gawking. Gweilos are still a novelty to most people, and Chinese people can actually be pretty outgoing and will want to talk to you just because you&#039;re white. But yes I do get why China feels a lot more daunting than Taiwan.<br><br>If you go to Taiwan for a few years you&#039;ll get the opportunity to explore every inch of it and really get to know it. The main disadvantages in my mind is there&#039;s less geographic and cultural variety, and it can be a little harder to break into local social circles there. The older generations are very outgoing, the younger much less so. But if you&#039;re comparing it to Japan, yeah you can probably make local friends a lot easier.",

If you&#039;re mindful and observant I doubt you&#039;ll go around making many faux pas.<br>If you&#039;re interested a having a relationship over there maybe keep in mind people are generally (not all) relatively traditional. And if you ever get invited to eat say with a family it&#039;s very difficult to refuse their hospitality and I honestly never figured out how to handle that properly. Whenever people go travelling they bring back food to share from where they visited. You could perhaps bring something from where you&#039;re local to endear yourself to your new colleagues.<br><br>Oh yeah, wear masks if you&#039;re noticeably sick. IME if you don&#039;t, that is a faux pas (and that was a thing even before the rona).<br><br>If not already I strongly recommend making an effort to learn Mandarin. People will really appreciate even a rudimentary grasp of it, and you&#039;ll find your time there far more satisfying if you do. I always used Pleco to help translate stuff and Line is what everyone uses to communicate. As bonus learn a few words of Taiwanese.<br><br>If you&#039;re living anywhere outside probably Taipei/NTC or Kaohsiung you&#039;ll almost definitely want a scooter and even there it would be nice to have a license for when you travel. I hear the test is really easy to pass in Taiwan but better organising all that before you go.<br>Taiwan has a great transportation system to get around the island (I&#039;m a fan of the intercity buses and non-highspeed rail) but you just can&#039;t explore easily outside those cities or tourist attractions without your own transportation. I spent 9 months in bumfuck, Nantou, but spent my weekends out in Taichung because I didn&#039;t drive and that was the only place the buses went, which was a damn waste!",

The ones that aren&#039;t woke are just retarded and cannot maintain a basic conversation. The arabs that make up 20-30% of the female pool there are all either gold diggers, religious extremists or cum dumpsters.<br><br>German: Wokism got to them to the point you&#039;d think its a humiliation ritual to punish them for WW2, forget it unless you want her to drop a bomb randomly and tell you she wants a gangbang or &#039;&#039;to experiment with other guys&#039;&#039;, the ones in the south of germany aren&#039;t so fucked up in the head however.<br><br>Austria: Same as germany, but there are a few who are really sane and don&#039;t play games but they are boring as fuck and rigid. Austrians in general have that cold and robot attitude, some like it, others hate it.<br><br>Switzerland: French part are cum sluts copy-pasting parisian women and many are also very political, german side are the insufferable woke bitches or the boring rigid ones that behave like robots, the italian part ones are actually not too bad.<br><br>Italy: The ones in the north are 50/50, you&#039;ll either meet a gem or a chick that will ruin your life. The ones in Bologna are woke but a lot of activist students live there. The ones in the south often come from poorer backgrounds so expect a lot of gold digging the minute they see you are doing okay for yourself.<br><br>Baltics: Estonian women were the best of the bunch, the prettiest too. I had very good vibes from them and they were easy to exchange with. Lithuanian women are cum rags and gold diggers for the most part. Latvian women are very strange, cold and reserved from what i saw but once you get to know them they open up a lot more.<br><br>Polish: Gold digger galore, many have multiple fuck friends and think with their vagina instead of their brain.<br><br>Spain: Woke.",

I can spend an entire day walking around an American city like Denver and see few if any attractive young women. But even a small European town like Elk, Poland will have more than its fair share of summertime cuties strolling around. The tendency of Americans is to hide away in private, climate-controlled safe spaces, only going out for designated exercise periods (if they aren&#039;t sedentary lardasses like 70% of the population). Europeans, like most other normal humans, prefer being outdoors when the weather is halfway decent, and consider a 2 km walk with a bag of groceries to be perfectly normal and routine.",

I just thought you could enter/exit through any opening like any other public transportation in any other city.<br><br>So I absentmindedly entered a tram through the exit. Then I hear a voice over the loudspeaker.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Hey man, you gotta go in through the entrance!&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Come on, man, get out and try again!&quot;</span><br>By then, the tram&#039;s doors had shut and started moving.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Get your ass over here!&quot;</span><br><br>So there&#039;s a service desk in the middle of the tram. Pic related. Unlike the pic, the man behind the desk wasn&#039;t an old Dutch man, it was a young Surinamese man. He proceeded to give me a loud tongue-lashing over what I did was illegal, and if the public transport authorities happened to see this, I would be fined. There was no professionalism to be had, he was keeping it real.<br>&quot;You can&#039;t fucking do that shit! You want to spend your money on weed and bitches, not on transportation fines! I&#039;m not mad at you, I just want to keep you out of trouble!&quot;<br><br>Then at some point he forgot that he was giving me an ass-chewing and pulled out an Amsterdam tourist brochure. On the back, in the Notes section, he started writing down names of his favorite restaurants, places to get weed, and a VR arcade.<br><br>I wasn&#039;t even mad at him. After years of watching so many comedy movies, being yelled at by a black man with a funny accent just doesn&#039;t fill me with anger, fear, or hatred. I was actually trying really hard not to laugh.",

Not much time to travel. They can&#039;t afford to waste an entire day of just walking or several days of learning how to ski.

I go every Summer, sometimes multiple times. The scenery especially around Southern Okanagan from Osoyoos to Penticton is spectacular. I love how the lakes are surrounded by the arid desert landscape. It&#039;s one of the best places in this part of the world to go for a swim, temperatures in the Summer often reach the high 30s and sometimes into the 40s. All my favourite summer fruits are grown in the region, lots of places offering upick for cheap prices. A couple years ago I picked like 30 pounds of cherries for $1/lbs. I&#039;m not much of a wine drinker but the vineyards have great views and good food. If it was a little bit closer I would be there all the time, but maybe it&#039;s good that it&#039;s about 400km from Vancouver, it&#039;s already packed in the Summer.",

Be sure to visit the railroad tressels at Myra Canyon and get some of the fruit leather and syrup at Summerland Sweets. Peachland has a nice view of the lake that you can walk along (the Bliss Bakery is popular for breakfast and lunch, as is the Gasthaus for dinner). Kelowna is really nice to walk around as well; they have a nice mall (I\u2019m not a mall guy but it\u2019s chill there), the waterfront, and the downtown has some nice stores and parks. Summer is the main tourist season; the whole area has a completely different feeling in the winter; not worse, just different because of the snow, darkness, and lack of tourists. Kelowna has a reputation for being cliquey but I\u2019ve always found people are very polite. It\u2019s a nice area to hide away if you\u2019re retired or nomading, particularly if you can find a place with a view of the lake.<br><br>I\u2019ve never been in the spring but my mother has told me it\u2019s lovely because everything is still green. That actually threw me driving through Merritt in the winter; I had only ever seen it in the summer when the grass has all died, so I wasn\u2019t prepared to see it looking green.",

Usually has kayak rentals and a floating water park for kids near the Bliss (which also has a nice shopping area with a toy store, and a park across the street with a xylophone). You can also dock the boat in Peachland\u2019s downtown at the marina and grab ice cream there; there\u2019s a park across the street where they have a farmer\u2019s market on Sundays in the summer. Sometimes there are craft fairs by the church. There are places to go swimming, beaches both in and further out of town, a salmon run to the south. There are cliffs that people jump off near Rattle Snake Island (towards Penticton) and some nice vineyards to look at on the mountain there (mountain goats are also fond of that area by the highway). You can boat into Kelowna, there are a few restaurants with marinas.<br><br>I\u2019m not sure if Todd\u2019s Tent Town is still there; I think they may have sold it, but there are other campgrounds just south of Peachland. There\u2019s also a small strip mall with a grocery store, a library, a dollar store, and an A&amp;W. There\u2019s also a tennis court and a skatepark here, as well as a smaller creek where salmon swim.<br><br>I could go on. There is so much to see and do there.",

If you&#039;re under 30 it&#039;s a 10/10 place to explore, party, fuck and get drunk. Family travel is okay you got a awesome Zoo (seriously Hagenbeck is fantastic) and the Miniature wonderland is great for the kids and I also really enjoyed that. Gourmet food lover get their fix there too and for the old you got some world class golf courses and culture.<br>I agree Hamburg is special but it&#039;s still worth 2-3 days for any age group while Frankfurt is complicated and for special interests unless you&#039;re willing to take day trips as you find so many great places a 1h train ride away that are almost untouched by tourism and really shine.",

I have been there twice, once in the height of summer a couple of years ago (35 degrees) and then just this last February when it was covered in snow and both were lovely in their own way. The only advice I would give for Potsdam is to book online if you want to go inside any of the buildings now, as I didn&#039;t know that and the first time I went was in the height of summer and I could not get in to the palaces. The park is free and you can wander around in anycase and I still had a great time, but it was disappointing as I love palace interiors and I didn&#039;t know at that stage I would ever be back in Potsdam as I thought it was a once in a lifetime thing. But I have since found myself back in Berlin like 5 times in the last couple of years and this winter there was no need to book in advance as there just weren&#039;t many people there. I could get a ticket to see sanssouci and the New Palace on the day.<br><br><br>Same goes for the reichstag. Its free, but you have to book. All of my trips to Berlin have been last minute and I have never been able to get a slot. Even when I was last there - a week out all the places had been reserved.<br><br><br><a href=\"#p2800545\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2800545</a><br>I understand on paper why people can like Hamburg, its just for several reasons I didn&#039;t really enjoy it. I loved my day trip to Lubeck, but didn&#039;t vibe with the city. To be fair it was pouring with rain and in the middle of winter, and the weather makes a huge difference to how you enjoy a place. While the old shipyard area would have been cool to chill out and stroll around on a nice day - Ice cold song winds and rain made the experience not that great. Plus not to be too politically incorrect; I hated the whole migrants/ immigrants who make (at least the central and north of the transtation) the whole area feel sketchy and like you are in the Middle East or Africa. Same with Frankfurt, though as a physical city I find Hamburg to be more interesting.",

There&#039;s a small old town with some history/museums, Kleinmarkthalle for foodies and the \u00c4pplerkneipen (Cider taverns) in Sachsenhausen for the general traveler. The Opera is great if you enjoy that, it has a cool zoo but again not for everyone, then you have a great food scene if you&#039;re into upper/gourmet tier food, some gentleman clubs for p2p and a interesting nightlife/club scene that is it&#039;s own thing.<br>To put it simple Frankfurt is a banking city and the center (CBD) will start to empty out at the end of business hours and is pretty much ded by 9pm as everyone goes back to their &quot;village in the city&quot; or any comfy place within a 1h train/car radius. What is left is the junky/red light center around the main station and the designated nightlife areas.<br><br>Frankfurt Airport is well connected (straight to the ICE network) if you don&#039;t have connecting flights it&#039;s actually a okay airport to arrive/depart just keep in mind this thing is a maze under perma construction for over 10 years and will stay that way for at least 5 more. So depending on when you arrive it can be super smooth or wild stuff.<br><br>Do what you want but IMO it&#039;s a okay place to stay for 1-2 days just stay outside of the Bahnhofsviertel and it&#039;s good.",

In 2002, there were two violent attacks on TVI personnel resulting in 15 people being killed. The second of these attacks happened on December 26, 2002 when, according to TVI, &quot;an unidentified group of armed terrorists ambushed a vehicle carrying TVI employees&quot; travelling between Canatuan and Siocon. Thirteen people were killed and 12 people were wounded.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TVI employs armed paramilitary guards known as Special Civilian Armed Auxiliaries (SCAA). These guards are trained and armed by the Philippine military, but employed by TVI. The guards man numerous checkpoints between the town of Siocon and the mine in Canatuan. Having recently visited the area, I can attest to the fact that at least the first of these checkpoints is on the public road outside of the mine&#039;s concession area. The SCAA guards control the movement of goods and people on and off the site, which is also part of the government-recognized ancestral land of the local Subanon people. Leaders of the indigenous community who oppose the mine have been singled out for victimization. The legitimate and recognized &quot;Timuay&quot; or leader of the Subanon of Canatuan, Timuay Jos\u00e9 Anoy, is no longer allowed to pass the checkpoints to go to his home, nor can others from Canatuan who have expressed opposition to the mine. TVI is clearly not in compliance with its 1997 Environmental Compliance Certificate that requires the company to assure that &quot;public roads shall remain open to allow the free flow of traffic.&quot;</span>",

It&#039;s a weapons based striking art vaguely similar to JKD. So you&#039;re going to want to work on your distance control, disarming techniques, and footwork. Have a friend use a dowel to simulate a club and practice evasive maneuvers while looking for an opening to close the distance. You&#039;re definitely going to want to focus on your Krav Maga and BJJ training. <br>Besides that, be smart. Filipinos tend to be all bark and no bite, so if they insult or disrespect you or even look at you funny, let them have it. If you see someone following you or even vaguely suspect somebody is up to no good, get in his face. Shout him down, shove him, everything. The point is to be aggressive, confrontational, and violent. This will solve 99% of your problems. On the very low chance one has a gun, you can be sure he doesn&#039;t know how to use it and can be (relatively) safely disarmed with a quick strike to the hand/ elbow. <br>You&#039;re welcome.",

Just obey all the rules, don&#039;t screw up, and try not to die, and they&#039;ll be fine. And they get to bring some of their own cultural exports (e.g. food) to Dubai, etc.<br><br>Could anyone who&#039;s actually been there (or is there) perhaps corroborate? Said correspondent... let&#039;s just say he&#039;s had a modest track record of (mildly) pushing certain libright political agendas here and there.

Tokyo gets labeled as soulless but I find that it offers the most opportunities for expats. As long as you\u2019re not working in traditional international or Japanese corporate environments, I think Tokyo can be very rewarding with practically endless hobby, socializing, and other side activities. Still the macro trade-off with Japan, or even South Korea, compared to SEA is general stability and modern infrastructure for less vibrant interactions. In many ways places like Thailand and Malaysia are the emerging Asian economic power houses with tons of exciting opportunities. I lived in Japan for two years in the early 2010s. Although I was working for an American government contractor the experience was great. I had an apartment near Yokohama but had tons of friends further out. The pace of life in the smaller towns like Chiba and areas near Sagami Bag south of Yokosuka were idyllic. In short, I\u2019d recommend trying out Japan for six months to a year. You may like it. Both city and smaller cities have tons to offer.",

Japan has alot of GLARING flaws however, I would tolerate these flaws rather than dealing with the BS of many other parts of the world America included.<br>I enjoy being able to go for a night walk in a *sketchy* part of town and the only hazard I have to deal with is touts and cute girls. I love the fact that service here isnt some *inconvenience* to the business owner and is part of the product. And I love the easily accessible natural beauty that&#039;s only 45mins away by train. I like not getting entirely jewed house hunting or renting becuase real-estate here isnt utterly pozzed by kike private equity firms in the US. Yeah they have ugy modern architecture and there is a huge issue of social problems like loneliness and stress but keep in mind its what you make it.",

You need a bit of travel experience before being comfortable with that stuff.<br>Vlor\u00eb is nice but one beach is like full of kitsch hotels for tourists, and the other is sketchy with stray dogs and abandoned buildings. It must be fun during high season to maybe get into the pants of some tourists, drink beers, and there are a few nice architectural things to look at in the city, the mountains and so on but otherwise, it&#039;s like travelling to a third-world country, which is okay but probably not what OP wants.<br>I do agree going to Sarajevo or perhaps Ljubljana which is more realistic, instead of Munich, would be better, and I agree that Italy is a country you can&#039;t bored of as a tourist, maybe Trieste instead of Munich is a better idea.

If you want to fuck with them you report them to the local country&#039;s (the country that they are currently in) immigration agency and tax revenue department... the officials would very much like to know what visa they have to be doing such long stays while earning an income: you can&#039;t legally work/earn an income in pretty much any country on a simple tourist visa, they might overstaying their tourist visa with such long drawn out trips and could be legally deported, and if they are earning an income while in the country (especially if they have stayed over 180 days) they could be liable to local taxes to the country&#039;s tax revenue department. Also worth noting you can report them to their company if you find out who they work for- a lot of these guys are breaking company TOS by working remotely outside of their company&#039;s immediate geographic areas or out of the country by using a VPN- and get them fired or at least forced to move back home. Another trick with regards to American digital nomads is to find out what state they are a resident of (ask in polite conversation or take a sneak peak of their drivers license/id) and, if their state has a state income tax (eg California or South Carolina, etc) report them to their resident state tax department for possibly not being compliant with state income taxes- a lot of digital nomads are dumb as fuck with their tax set up and forget to change state residencies from income tax states to non-income tax states like Florida or Texas (especially the cancerous libtard reddit types who are scared of muh red states) and many I imagine might be owing tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of dollars to their resident state tax department.",

I literally said this right in my first sentence. The problem is retards like you, while compliant with Federal taxes, often forget to set up your state residency in a non-income tax state before going overseas and then forget to pay your state income taxes to your resident state when digital nomading. State tax revenue departments will definitely come looking for their cut if you are not compliant, with late fees, penalties and interest accumulating with each passing day past the filing date of the year you are not compliant. A lot of you also have no real estate of your own, which means that for (legally required) state residency purposes such as for bank accounts, mail, passports, insurance, etc you are using your parent&#039;s or relative&#039;s address, and if that address is in an income tax state and you aren&#039;t paying those state taxes, that state will come looking, and some of these states are notoriously aggressive with pursuing these state income taxes, some times years down the line after the above mentioned penalties have had time to aggressively accrue and compound.",

The issue with both too many third world immigrants in the US and digital blowfags gentrifying local communities overseas is the same exact cancer: American soiboi liberal/leftist redditor trash. Their low IQ understanding of politics and economics are responsible for both problems, and they deserve the consequences both at home and overseas for the problems they cause wherever this plague of cancer goes. Your duty is to shame and chase these people out wherever they go. I promise you no one who voted for Trump is going to care that some California soiboi redditor digital nomad got pressed by local Mexicans in Mexico, in fact they would probably encourage it, these people deserve to suffer.",

For what it&#039;s worth, I&#039;m not the kind to go to bars or go out late at night. I sleep early so I can wake up early to beat the crowds in the morning. I&#039;m also Asian, so people generally assume I don&#039;t speak English. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Japan</span><br>Great. No bothers you at all. Probably only had a conversation with 1 other person during my 3 week trip that wasn&#039;t a service worker of some kind. Excellent customer service for the most part. There was one place that was so overly attentive, I actually felt a bit unnerved. They noticed things like me struggling to use the sauce bottle, so they replaced the bottle. Saw I was slowing down on eating, and asked if I wanted to take it to go, via Google translate.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Spain</span><br>Honestly didn&#039;t get harassed at all. But I went in 2021, right after places were opening up. If anything, I felt quite invisible in Spain. It was weird hearing about how friendly and warm Spaniards are, when really, I felt they were very apathetic. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;France</span><br>Honestly, a bit sketch in some places. Encountered someone wanking it at a bus stop and another time saw a dude pissing at train station wall (bathroom was downstairs). I&#039;m not saying avoid, but I found Paris (and Nice) lacking. Lots to do, but keep your ears peeled. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sweden (not solo)</span><br>Honestly, I thought Nordics were supposed have cold autistic people. They were quite friendly and most spoke English. Felt very safe. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Baltics (not solo)</span><br>I went to the capital cities and honestly felt very safe. They don&#039;t have as much people so the nice part is lack of crowds. They&#039;re not as visually friendly, as in, they don&#039;t smile very much, but some will help you out if you have problems with things. Like in Riga, I was trying to buy milk and couldn&#039;t figure out the differences, even with Google translate. And another customer saw me struggle and helped explain to me the differences. I think everyone has their personal favorite Baltic capital. Mine was definitely Vilnius. Great food.",

It&#039;s basically better to be polite to quickly resolve a situation than it is anything, passive mode saves time on things you can deal with later.<br><br>The second is because if you are polite you ultimately villainize the other party who is being rude in the social situation you find yourself in. You can grit your teeth for a bit but society will have your back on it. If someone is being a bull simply being nice is a non-confrontational way of making them look like a fool.<br><br>I always laugh when my friends from europe visit me and tell me about trips to America where they complain about &quot;fake niceness&quot; there but in Japan they are blind to it simply because they have don&#039;t know the subtle things they do here for showing annoyance. Japan, Tokyo specifically, is about wearing the mask society demands of you to wear without question. It&#039;s one reason why &quot;drinking with coworkers&quot; is still a thing to some degree, it&#039;s so that managers can see you hopefully drop that mask and get a 1 up on you.",

They share many values, like family (in that certain way), celebrating alt holidays with food, work ethic, and wealth/greed or frugality/thrift depending on which way one swings.<br><br>Like I know Indians, by contrast, would be more into traditional Indian music, and I (a 2nd generation chink) have 2nd generation jeet friends who&#039;ve had to suffer in sitar or tabla class growing up, similar to how I had to suffer in piano class.<br><br>Wang Jun&#039;s a loser back home who failed the hell out of the gaokao, so he tries his luck with the US visa lottery, and luck proves to be on his side. Upon arrival, he discovers American naming customs, and either calls himself &quot;John Wang&quot; like the 900 other Wangs who came before him and had the same idea, or falls into the Bible pipeline and chooses some really niche name like &quot;Mordecai Wang&quot;.<br><br>Now Wang wants to be successful, he wants to start a family, and he wants his kids to be successful. So what does he do? He looks at (((successful people))) and studies how they got there. Obv, (((the real reason))) has jackshit to do with meritocracy or &quot;Protestant&quot; work ethic or whatever woo he buys into, but it&#039;s not like he knows this. But his habits change accordingly.<br><br>I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s different in China vs outside of it, because of pressure to succeed as an immigrant or whatever.

It&#039;s just too polished and perfect, and even contains car-sized gates and stuff.<br><br>And if you actually go to the Great Wild Goose Pagoda, they interestingly don&#039;t allow pictures inside. For context, the pagoda was commissioned for the monk Xuanzang, who was the IRL basis of the monk from the Monkey King / Journey to the West story. There&#039;s this multicolored spherical thing which is supposed to be &quot;Monk Xuanzang&#039;s essence&quot; or something like that, but who knows how true that is or how old that is. The pagoda was supposed to house tons of Buddhist scriptures, but I saw no scriptures, or even replicas thereof. Just smooth beige walls, stairs, and that &quot;relic&quot;.<br><br>It&#039;s as &quot;original&quot; as the contemporaneous Badaling section of the Great Wall (Ming dynasty), known for its generous renovation and proximity to Beijing. Nanjing&#039;s wall from the same era is a little mossier from the pics, so it might be more authentic, but I&#039;ve never been.<br><br>Still worth visiting IMO, but to say it&#039;s truly the OG OG might be a little misleading. IDK though.<br><br>(Also check out Datong fyi, I forget which dynasty their wall was from, but it was probably rebuilt during your lifetime.)",

For instance, the dai pai dong in the Central and Western District are regard as &quot;terrace type&quot; dai pai dong since most of the streets are sloped, meaning the stalls occupy different terraces. In the late 20th century, the Hong Kong government decided to restrict the operation and license of dai pai dong in order to remove them from public streets. Some were relocated into indoor cooked food markets built by the government. After the decline of dai pai dong from the 1970s, most of them no longer operate within the family but through sole proprietorship or partnership instead.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;According to the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, only 17 dai pai dong remained in Hong Kong as of July 2024, down from the 25 in 2014.</span><br><br>What&#039;s up with this? Is it another Mainland W? Are the da pai dang places I visit in Mainland China not &quot;real&quot; da pai dang (which is sort of the same situation as Abrahamic houses of worship)?",

Though you have to weigh it, many of the heavy hitters add a 3-5% charge on it, like utilities/rent/car payments, etc. I use my AAdvantage card for everyday purchases and it&#039;s easy way to rack things up as I often at the end of the year have 1-2 flights round trip to Japan and back.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do they really forego cash back rewards just so they fly domestic business class a few times a year?</span><br>If you travel a lot it makes sense, also miles can be used for hotels, car rentals, and so on.

For me free lounge access, early boarding, free bag, and ability to collect miles &gt;&gt;&gt; rewards card from others or the &quot;1-3%&quot; cash back that only applies to X/y/z and maybe adds up to something. My job allows me to use personal cards for booking on my travel so long as I expense it all through concur I get refunded, so it&#039;s literally free vacations for me.",

Earning points/miles through sign-up bonuses is easy enough: apply for card, get approved, spend minimum amount within set timeframe, downgrade to free card or cancel after one year, repeat as often as possible. Actually redeeming the miles for premium international flights at a not-awful rate is often much more difficult and the part that many of the bloggers and tiktok travel influencer types will gloss over. People will literally spend dozens of hours researching this shit, hunting for deals, and talking on the phone with airline booking agents to get some of the most lucrative and aspirational redemptions, like business-class flights to asia. Unless that sounds like a fun game to you, or you can make really good use of the ancillary benefits of a travel-specific card, you&#039;re probably better off with your cash back bullshit.",

But they&#039;re insanely overpriced and you have to wade through a sea of homeless vagrants to get to them. I went to a wine tasting in LA a few months ago at a rooftop bar at a super nice hotel. I parked directly across the street less than block away. You should have seen the people down on that block. There were literally dozens of homeless people camped outside. I saw 2 fights in 30 seconds. It looked like the walking dead. <br><br>The wine tasting was amazing though. It was me and like 50 smoking hot 10/10 milfs on a rooftop bar drinking Italian wine at sundown.",

During my decades in SF, I went to LA a number of times, and started off hating it by default. But I came to appreciate the place a great deal over the years, despite my initial prejudice.<br><br>Some things about it do suck by any sane standards. It is less a city than a very large, sprawling, suburban region, dominated by and catering to cars, and it\u2019s got the traffic to prove it. But there are hundreds if not thousands of really cool things\u2014food, entertainment, art, interesting architecture, parks and green spaces\u2014scattered throughout the sprawling wasteland. While it lacks San Francisco\u2019s \u2018real city\u2019 density and can be defensibly regarded as its architectural/infrastructural/physi<wbr>cal plant inferior, LA is so much larger that it still has a lot more going on, and more to offer. It just might take two hours on a freeway to get to the nice bits.<br><br>At one point I might have argued that SF was cooler and LA more superficial and shallow, but both of those stereotypes are out of date and exaggerated. Rising tech monoculture and even faster-rising housing prices have been driving the coolest, most creative, and most interesting people out of SF for literal decades, while squeezing the non-tech underclasses and anyone who can\u2019t afford to move harder and harder, leaving the city both more sterile and more seedy year over year. LA remains cheaper and has never really been completely dominated by a single economic sector (it\u2019s a global media and entertainment epicenter, but that\u2019s never been the only game in town), so its creative and artistic underbelly is more vital.<br><br>And the weather is arguably nicer down south, at least if you like warmth, although I personally like San Francisco\u2019s cool and foggy climate a lot.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tl;dr\u2014LA is better than its reputation but its reputation isn\u2019t fiction.</span>",

Checking their website, I see a $268 fare for August 29th, and multiple sub-$300 fares for September with the lowest being a $216 fare for September 10th. <br><a href=\"#p2801522\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2801522</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;can&#039;t afford to take a vacation unless his employer pays for it</span><br>And you Euros have the gall to call me a poorfag. lel",

And although there is much that is wonderful about this country, I\u2019ve always felt that it\u2019s a little overrated as a tourist destination\u2014it\u2019s clean and safe and in many places beautiful, and it has the best transit system in Europe by light years, but it\u2019s also very, very expensive, arguably somewhat boring, and although our mountains are pretty and accessible, we haven\u2019t got much in the way of true wilderness. Our natural-beauty areas are too landscaped and developed for a lot of /out/ types, even if we can offer scenic hikes and nice lake views. And our neighbors all have better food than we do, apart from Germany, which is at least as bad but costs half as much, and Austria, which is also not a gourmet destination but has good caf\u00e9s.<br><br>Among Swiss cities, Luzern and Lausanne (not the same place!), are arguably our heaviest hitters for tourism. Much nicer for a visitor than, for example, Z\u00fcrich or Geneva. Luzern is locally regarded as overtouristed, but you probably won\u2019t notice. Good for boat trips on the big lake, walking around a cute little old city, and an easy trip up a mointain in a gondola. Lausanne is great for lakefront. The little cities of Ticino, the one Italian-majority canton, are also really nice, with either Lugano or Locarno having a lot to offer.<br><br>When it comes to alpine destinations, it depends on the season and personal preferences. The Lauterbrunnen area in the Bernese Oberland is beloved by tourists, for good reason (it is otherworldly in its natural beauty), but locals are jaded and unfriendly, and it\u2019s incredibly touristy. My favorite mountain towns are in canton Bern and Canton Graub\u00fcnden, but which are best depends on what you want to do.<br><br>If this is a serious inquiry I am happy to share additional thoughts.",

Highlights are Schloss Spiez in Spiez and the castle at Oberhofen am Thunersee, which has ancient roots but is in its modern preserved/restored form mostly a 19th-century folly. Still very impressive. You can get around the lake to all of the above by ferryboat.<br><br>As you\u2019ll be in Thun and you\u2019re interested in Interlaken (which is much more popular among foreigners than Swiss people, but it\u2019s a decent, comparatively cheap destination for outdoor sports and an attractive setting), you might like to go ahead and visit Lauterbrunnen, which is very close and very picturesque, no matter how much I badmouthed it above. Another pretty option is Wengen.<br><br>The fortified basilica above Sion is worth the walk up the hill.

I&#039;ve been to Sofia and the area around the Rila mountains, so I don&#039;t know much about the eastern part of the country.<br>It is definitely much cheaper compared to western European standards. This may somewhat change, since they&#039;re going to adopt the euro starting 1 Jan 2026, but I doubt we&#039;ll see massive price hikes in the near future. Sofia is a nice city, there&#039;s good enough public transport and other related services, even though some parts can be run down or not as well kept (standard eastern european fare). I really liked hiking in the Rila mountains. <br>Bulgarian people seemed rather nice, although I think you&#039;re going to struggle having any semblance of social life unless you&#039;re fluent in the language. It seems like most educated bulgarian youths leave to seek better paying jobs elsewhere in the EU, so most of the people who stay are the ones who are too poor / old / uneducated to leave. If you care about social life I might suggest neighboring Romania instead. Bucharest is a very lively city with a nice nightlife, you&#039;re more likely to find young people who speak French and/or English (and Romanian should be easier to pick up since it&#039;s a Latin language, unlike Bulgarian), and it&#039;s still way cheaper than western Europe.

Yeah I&#039;d like to visit of course but mostly it&#039;s to stay and live there for a while and maybe more. Ideally I&#039;d get a social life but it&#039;s often hard abroad (unless with western expat types but i am not that interested).<br>And it depends where. For example in south america it was easy making local acquaintances (i do speak ok spanish) even if superficial. In asia i found it really hard. I don&#039;t know how it is in those parts.<br><br>Romania seems interesting. I hesitated between it and Bulgaria and I picked Bulgaria because of the food i saw, mostly. But i intend to travel 2/3 weeks in the Balkans then rent a place to live for about ~6 months (hence why EU/schengen matters here). I have like A2 Russian so i could survive in Bulgaria but learning Romanian does seem way easier for me indeed.",

It&#039;s MGM so it comes with strip pricing for gambling and food. I&#039;d suggest staying elsewhere like NYNY or Park MGM if you want to be on the south end of the strip, but you do you. <br><br>Your itinerary looks good. I&#039;d skip Penn &amp; Teller and go to Absinthe instead. Penn &amp; Teller is for a boomer crowd. They have some good tricks but it&#039;s stuff you&#039;ve seen before and/or can figure out easily. Absinthe will cost around $150, totally worth it tho. It&#039;s the best show in Vegas. <br><br>Museums are fun. If you&#039;re doing Neon and Mob museum, might as well do the Fremont experience too since you&#039;ll be a block away. <br><br>For food there&#039;s millions of places to chow. Like <a href=\"#p2758817\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2758817</a> said pick the type of food you want and you&#039;ll have plenty of choices nearby. My personal favorite spots on the strip are Lavo (fancy italian), Yardbird (fancy southern), Hash House a Go Go (DDD style breakfast &amp; burgers), and Wicked Spoon (buffet). <br><br>Strongly recommend checking out some of the speakeasies too. It&#039;s really fun to scope them out beforehand, then take your group to them while they think you&#039;re insane and opening doors you shouldn&#039;t open. Cosmopolitan has 3 and they&#039;re all awesome, there are also some on Fremont. Here&#039;s the Cosmo ones: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IId<wbr>m3cZ7ZJ8",

My best friend still lives there and I&#039;ve been going 3-4 times a year since the 2000&#039;s. Vegas is drastically different than in was even just 3-4 years ago. <br><br>Downtown Vegas on Fremont street was scary when I first visited Vegas. They smartly tore down all the dilapidated section 8 and crappy motels and put in new businesses and completely revitalized downtown. On the weekends, it&#039;s completely packed. <br><br>Crime on the Strip was pretty rare before covid. The crowd was always 80 percent white. After they legalized weed, it&#039;s mostly black people on the weekends walking around and crime is through the roof. Crime rates doubled in Vegas after covid. Literally everything is locked up in every grocery store. You have to be buzzed in to the CVS on weekends on the strip. <br><br>The other big difference are the prices. Every casino on the strip charges a resort fee of $40/night + $25 a day parking + increased room rates + they restrict the free drinks. The buffets are mostly gone and the few that are left are insanely expensive. <br><br>Vegas used to really push for families to visit, but most of the family themed stuff on the strip is long gone. No more waterpark, no arcades, no free pirate show, no buffets, no room deals at the nicer resorts.",

But you&#039;ll have a better time staying downtown if you&#039;re on a budget. <br>I always drive to Vegas. If you have a car, the strip hotels are just nicer. If you look up hotels on Expedia or Travelocity, anything cheaper than Treasure Island is going to be shitty. That&#039;s a good rule of thumb. Planet Hollywood is probably the best of the cheap strip hotels. The Paris would be second best of the cheap ones. If you want to spend a little more for a nicer hotel, look up Vdara and Aria. <br><br>Avoid Circus Circus(mexicans), the Rio (blacks), The Strat (too far), Harrahs (old), anything off the strip on west Tropicana (ghetto).",

You&#039;re never going to win the big jackpots so you&#039;re left with what amounts to ultra low volatility machines where the only &#039;jackpots&#039; you&#039;ll see are 5x wins, you never see line wins of more than 5x and features rarely breach 20x.

If you can afford it, you should get a room at the sky suites. You\u2019ll have an even better time if you can get yourself a host, such as my great host Al\u2019.<br><br>Once again, the Aria. The lobby always has a beautiful art display, and another one made of edible sweets in a glass case by the bakery. Just outside of the Shops at Crystals, there\u2019s an art exhibit, which has some interactive rooms. The Sphere is also great, especially if you can get V.I.P. passes/tickets, though the movie is really boring and I\u2019d only do it if seeing a concert or to experience the lobby area where you wait for the show. <br><br>Hate to be a shill, but once again, the Aria. There\u2019s a restaurant called Javier\u2019s which is amazing. There\u2019s another called Julian Serranos, I would skip out on that one if I were you. There\u2019s also a Carbone inside but it\u2019s very overrated. You\u2019ll also find a food court with all kinds of food, including a pizza restaurant owned by Steve Aoki. I\u2019d recommend the Bao Buns from some restaurant there which I can\u2019t remember. If you can find it there\u2019s also a French Restaurant inside the same \u201cmini mall\u201d type place by the Shops at Crystals that has the ice skating rink. Yellow Tail is always very good and that one is the one place you need to go to, no questions asked.<br><br>Happy Travels Anon!",

If it&#039;s 72 degrees that&#039;s tolerable but this time of year it&#039;s 110 and miserable to be outside more than a few minutes unless you&#039;re at a pool. <br><br>You can walk through casinos to get to the next door property sometimes. That&#039;s a lot better when it&#039;s sweltering. There&#039;s also some free transport stuff like the free tram that connects Bellagio, Aria, and Park MGM. I think Mandalay Bay &amp; Excalibur have a free tram too. <br><br>There&#039;s also a paid monorail (pic rel) on the east side of the strip which gets a lot of hate but I&#039;ve used it plenty of times with no issue. The drawback is the monorail drops you off at the edge of properties so you have to walk a long way to get to the strip. IIRC a 24hr unlimited monorail pass is around $16",

Getting credit linked and not transferred was difficult and a long process but ultimately doable. I finalized the sale at the nadir of Egyptian-US currency last month so I got a very good deal. It should cost at least $120k or more. The balcony has a direct view of the Giza pyramids and Cairo lit up at night off the the side. It\u2019s in a gaurded neighborhood with international richfags and expats. Has its own parks, courts, gathering areas halls etc, and great schools incl American ones.<br><br>Overall Egyptian scammers are very eay to beat since they have a strong aversion to spic tier violence. You have to trick them and get them to fuck off and get seperated from you. That\u2019s one reason people go out in groups there. You\u2019ll get fucked with more alone. Oh, pro-tip, if your woman wears a burka you will suddenly not get fucked with.<br><br>People there can be kind hearted but be smart. Egypt is the safest country in Africa and has almost no violent crime. The police WILL FUCK UP any violence and their culture just simply absorbs any non-aversive behavior and gets rid of itz<br><br>I like Egypt alot and probably gonna eventually cheaply invest in a coastal villa.",

And whatever tourist fatigue plagues resort/beach areas, I have encountered no shortage of genuine friendliness and warmth in many parts of both Greece and Italy (especially Sicily, but YMMV). I think that even in real tourist traps one can sometimes feel the \u2018love\u2019 part of the all-too-common love-hate relationship jaded hospitality people have with those foreign tourist assholes whose money they depend upon.<br><br>Otherwise, I guess I mostly agree with above posters that a lot of less-touristed places are often very welcoming to visitors.

I once spent a few hours with some working-class strangers in Siberia that I thought might end in their beating the shit out of me, but things got close to friendly by the time we\u2019d started in on the second carafe of vodka. My Russian is really, really limited, but I was told as we were parting ways that my only problem was my mediocre pronunciation, and also that they decided they liked me despite my being American because I\u2019d been willing to drink with them. I imagine that a more fluent Russian speaker could pull off something similar, with more sophisticated people, just by drinking tea.",

I was with a friend but he had his leg broken and could only walk on crutches. Most buildings were made of wood, there was a 4 year old kid smoking a cigarette. Chickens and ducks running around but a weak E signal (with 0 effective speed on my phone), from a cell tower somewhere very far away and a couple of Honda Wave scooters reminded us of civilization. <br>The owner of the house asked $50 for one night, we reduced it to $10 and negotiated a duck to be slaughtered and cooked for breakfast for extra $15. Such price was at least twice as high as the common price in that region. <br>The man kept his word and roasted the duck next day, however it was too dry. As the number of remaining chopped pieces of the duck went down it became obvious to us that the breast was absent from the plate. At first this caused some confusion, I checked the duck blood sauce because there was some meat in it but clearly it was pork and not duck breast. My friend was also certain it was pork because yesterday we had a stir fried pork dish with exactly the same meat in it. I stood up and, ripped my shirt open on the chest, pointing with the knife at my breasts and then gesticulating as if I was looking for something but could not find it. This produced the desired effect and the man brought half of the breast and a translated message \u201canother half is in the sauce\u201d. Fighting was impractical because it would have taken my friend at least 20 minutes to descend to the river and board our boat. We got the remaining pieces of the incomplete duck in a plastic bag, boarded the boat and went downstream. <br>I must say all other villagers except that man were very kind to us with a group of boys carrying our luggage in an out of the boat, young girls smiling and old people being significantly less hostile to us than the old people in any urban city in Vietnam.",

They poured in when the country was dirt cheap in 2022-23 because of the crisis, singing it praises but when the economic situation improved many of them begun to make videos bitching that the country was expensive and not worth it. OK bro, this is Buenos Aires, it was always a mid to high end destination (for Latin America), it&#039;s not Asuncion or Medellin you couldn&#039;t possibly expect the country to remain dirt cheap forever it was a temporary situation. And you should be happy people are making more money and the country averted total collapse, not bitch about how it&#039;s suddenly more expensive for you.<br><br>So these geomaxxing types kinda soured the mood because people begun to see them as just cheapskates attracted by low prices and what they thought were easy women (kek argentinas are crazy little princesses good luck with that) and not people actually interested in the country.

On top of that, a Croat girl locked me on a balcony when I was in Ljubljana searching for a hostel I could book on the spot, so I&#039;m weary of Croats now. That said I might still visit Rovinj and Pula one day.<br><br>Regarding Montenegro, I was in Podgorica for a few hours before going to Serbia, there is nothing to see and do there, so don&#039;t waste your time there.<br>But I&#039;ve heard very good things about the coast, Kotor of course, but also Petrovac, Budva and Ulcinj, which I need to visit one day.<br><br>Belgrade is awesome for nightlife, I love this city, it&#039;s a bit chaotic and overwhelming at times, but people are friendly, even if you see tall tough guys not smiling and frowning at you, that doesn&#039;t mean they dislike you, it&#039;s just the Slav grindset. There is an artificial lake where you can go swim, and buses are free, look it up.<br>Novi Sad and Subotica are also worth visiting, and for nature there is Bajina Basta.<br>Beware though, there are serious protests right now against Vu\u010di\u0107, I almost got stuck in Novi Sad because the government shut down all the trains for two days to prevent protestors to come to Belgrade. After one big protest ended up violently at night, people were so pissed off they started blocking parts of the cities. Look at what&#039;s happening on N1 News.<br><br>Be aware that summer temperatures can be very high and heatwaves are common. So carry a bottle of water, a cap, etc. Enjoy!",

It surprised me when I got there (I wasn&#039;t traveling on a schedule) I arrived in Tirana and made my way down the coastline stopping in various beach towns. You just show up at the central bus station (no bookings) there is like 500 busses all with different locations on the front window, the drivers wait until it fills up with the appropriate amount of people to make the money they want and they leave. Another bus comes to replace it and so on. Was extremely chill if you aren&#039;t on an intense schedule I visited Vlore, Serande, Gjirokaster, Blue Lagoon, they were all good fun with good energy wish I was able to do some hiking and see some other beach towns. Great food cash is definitely needed.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Montenegro - 6 nights</span><br>Bus situation is a little similar although Montenegro&#039;s public transport was put together a little better, stayed in Podgorica for one night (that&#039;s literally all you need I see it as a transport hub lol) had an absolute blast in Kotor at the hostels, it was definitely a party vibe. Budva was fun and has some very nice scenery and cheap beach vibes. Be careful where you book accommodation because most of them are up a fucking steep hill and there aren&#039;t any local bus routes. Go to the little island and do some swimming and jump off the rocks etc. Tivat was definitely a rich person&#039;s docking station, I haven&#039;t been to Monaco but I imagine it would be similar vibes, cool to see some of the boats and its a pretty photogenic little town. Kotor was definitely the most fun in my visit though.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kosovo - 2 nights</span><br>Only went Kosovo as the cheapest flight leaving the Balkans was here, I spent two days walking around Pristina and there wasn&#039;t a whole lot to do. Food &amp; accommodation were extremely cheap and everyone was friendly but the place kind of gave weird vibes, fair enough considering their history.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;picrel Kotor</span>",

Fewer foreigners, so far fewer scammers. <br><br>Jaisalmer feels like an RPG castle town in the middle of the desert. I&#039;ve been all around the world and arriving there is still one of my most mind-blowing memories with the way this massive castle on a hill just rises from the desert as you approach. The entire castle town is made from intricately carved sandstone blocks. This picture I took doesn&#039;t capture the absolutely scale and beauty of it all.<br><br>Both Jodhpur and Jaisalmer are small-ish cities, so they&#039;re perfect for a short trip. You can take a day out into the desert from Jaisalmer, ride a camel, and there are options to camp out under the stars (wish I did it, but didn&#039;t have enough time).<br><br>I also loved Mumbai. As a large city, it&#039;s infinitely better than Delhi. Far fewer people trying to scam you, lots of museums and temples and historical stuff to see, cleaner than Delhi, better food than Delhi. <br><br>I think you could easily do a Mumbai+(Jaisalmer or Jodhpur) trip and be very satisfied. That&#039;s assuming you only have exactly 7 days including flights. If you can get about 9 days or so, Mumbai+Jaisalmer+Jodhpur are very feasible.<br><br>My biggest piece of advice is to wear boots when you go. I got cornered by huge ass dogs a few times and needed to kick them in the mouth when they tried to bite me. Would&#039;ve been fucked if I wore soft shoes (or like some retarded tourists, sandals)",

But the ones actually fucking mowing lawns and working (most of them, btw) are not bad people at all. You can be against getting taken over by foreigners while still recognizing that foreigners are individually good people.<br><br>But that&#039;s besides the point. Your analogy doesn&#039;t even make sense. Mexicans or Nafris or Indians or whatever else are low-income migrants, generally, and typically immigrate by the millions and form their own parallel societies. Whites don&#039;t really do this, except maybe in Europe. The majority of whites in Japan at any given time are just tourists there to get a look around and fuck off back home. Most Japanese are fine with that. <br><br>You&#039;re not blackpilled, you&#039;re just low IQ.",

It was 3 a.m., drinking Calvados, and someone passed around a spoon like it was contraband. No toast. No fig jam. Just liver, cold steel, and exhaustion. Tasted like victory and self-loathing.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A friend once smuggled sea urchin roe into LaGuardia in a contact lens case. We cracked it open in a taxi, scooped it with salt-and-vinegar chips, and washed it down with warm white Burgundy from a water bottle. Uni, jet fuel, and bad decisions. A perfect snack.</span>",

I didn&#039;t poop in the shower, I pooped in the toilet and didn&#039;t want to use up more of my own good toilet paper because I brought 3 rolls but one got ruined by water in my SUV and it was a tiny house so it was really hard being in the tiny bathroom and I didn&#039;t realize how much poop was stuck to my butt and it got in the shower drain - I thought I stomped it all down with my feet but apparently not. And as for the sheets I have a water bladder backpack I keep in bed cuz its easier that way and I didn&#039;t realize it had a tiny leak - it has been changed out now - but it was just water! <br>Oh and they were Christians too (bible quotes on the shitty art placed near the door). I also pissed off the other Christians I stayed with - I cracked their toilet seat (accidentally) and wouldn&#039;t pay the 54 dollars they wanted to fix it (the one night stay itself was only 100). <br>This is what I get for going to the Deep South - the people are not forgiving or understanding at all - sort of ironic given that they are all Christcuck boomers. <br><br>I hope this negative review of me doesn&#039;t hinder future travel - I&#039;ve noticed most listings are set to instant confirmation and the only one that wasn&#039;t the guy ended up being kinda a creeper and I should have cancelled when he didn&#039;t confirm my booking request for 12 hours.",

So I did so worrying if I didn&#039;t I would get a one star review - turns out it didn&#039;t matter anyways. <br><br>I should mention, this as during July 4th week and the listings were pretty slim cuz I book almost last minute because I do hiking and plan around the weather as much as the destination. <br><br>Oh, and the tiny home place said &quot;don&#039;t come back&quot; and that their cabin was the worst they&#039;ve ever seen it. Which I believe to be exaggeration. Yeah the sheets were wet but it was also mid-summer and fucking hot as shit and just a 1980s window ac unit mounted way high. I hate mutual review games.",

Anything remotely fun is expensive, any good food is expensive, the people are the fakest in the world, the overall vibe of people sucks, they just kiss ass the &quot;best and richest&quot; unless you hang out with the poor druggies who are all gay degens. As soon I graduate I will leave, but its not very easy either. Toronto used to be nice before 2015/16, now even in the city I live by Toronto its like 60% indians. I&#039;m not even racist but thats fucking retarded, and among most people (especially women) its very frowned upon to bring up the truth about anything regarding immigrants or liberal policies. Also not even a conservative because somehow they do the same shit, its just a fucking money farm for the rich pigs that don&#039;t even live here making millions off of real estate",

For food, my favorite restaurant was Kl\u00e1\u0161tern\u00ed \u0161enk. It&#039;s inside the grounds of an old monastery. It&#039;s a little outside the main part of the city, but it&#039;s between the airport and downtown. Its all locals and good place to eat on the way into the city. <br><br>Another good place to eat is Mincovna. Best soup I&#039;ve ever eaten. I&#039;d also recommend going and doing a beer tasting at U Kun\u0161t\u00e1t\u016f. I got hooked on the kronuts from Oh Deer bakery too. <br>For girls, go to showpark market. I&#039;ve heard good things about the Fear house, but I&#039;ve never been. <br><br>Definitely rent a car for a day and drive to Kutna Hora to do the Sedlec Ossuary. <br><br>Avoid Black Angel&#039;s Bar.

Because that first day in Thailand, the Monday you arrive, you arrive at 4.30, you&#039;re going to be jet-lagged and sleepy, so then you really only have Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. So it&#039;s like, you can&#039;t really do much. And you&#039;re pretty limited in terms of where you can go. I think two to two and a half weeks is the minimum, just day in Thailand. If you guys already have the time booked off, then just fucking go to Costa Rica or Mexico or somewhere in South America.",

Still sort of eats at me a little<br><br><a href=\"#p2794845\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2794845</a><br>This reminded me of another story from when I was 18 traveling around California. I was in San Francisco and could not find anywhere to stay. I was hanging out at a park talking to some homeless guy and this middle aged guy joined in. Anyways he talked a ton and blah blah I can get you work blah blah I&#039;ll get you a place to stay tonight you can&#039;t be on the streets here it&#039;s way too dangerous, here light my cigarette, I lit his cigarette and he mimed putting a knife in my side &#039;this is what will happen to you in the tenderloin, then next thing you know they&#039;re pimping you out and have you hooked on drugs blah blah&#039; so he took me to some hotel and greeted the receptionist &#039;linda baby how are you&#039; and she was like &#039;you know you&#039;re banned here right&#039; anyways I was totally exhausted and was sort of just going along with this guy because he was super overbearing personality but eventually I got the clue and got out of there. He definitely read as gay and I asked him and he said evasively &#039;I have a wife and kids at home.&#039; egh that made me very uneasy walking around SF for a couple days.",

I tried to play it off by keeping my earbuds in and acting like I couldn&#039;t hear but he ran to catch up to me. He just wanted money and fucked off when I said I didn&#039;t have any,<br><br>There were crackheads walking around trying to sell stolen 10 year old phones and ipads and shit. First store I walked into a bunch of nigs sprinted out with their shirts full of shit. Walked to White Castle (we don&#039;t have where I am from) and a fat ugly tranny had to take my order and give me my food through an iron fucking door with a porthole like a fucking prisoner. Worst fast food I&#039;ve ever had.<br><br>At the bus/train station there, I had to wait 5 hours for the train and a group of nigs posted up there were causing trouble. Smoking weed and cigarettes inside the terminal. They started harassing this other nig girl. She stood up for herself and they got in her face and basically threatened to beat her ass. I was alone so while I would&#039;ve tried to step in if I had to, I probably would&#039;ve gotten fucked up. Funny thing is, about 20 minutes later she went back over and started feeling on the same dude, then they went and fucked in the hallway. Guess she liked his aggression.<br><br>Conductor on the train was a little white dude who had more pent up incel rage than I&#039;ve ever seen out of anyone. Literally screaming at the top of his lungs for someone having their leg in the lane on a nearly empty train. I didn&#039;t know the stops, so the train stopped just for me somewhere I didn&#039;t actually want to go. Guy was so mad I thought he was going to quit and just leave the train. No clue what his problem was. I was beta then but now I probably would have told him to shut the fuck up or I&#039;d beat his ass. Literally talking to me like a petulant child.",

The people: yes we are all white here, but due to Russians and Estonians both living here it&#039;s not a cohesive society. The food: Eating out is expensive, there is no real eating out culture, good food can be had of course, but it&#039;s expensive and they gyp you with portion sizes so much. The nature: beautiful forests, but no mountains. <br><br><br>Every place has it&#039;s pros and cons, a big pro would be safety for example, street crime has dropped to a very low level.

The port also sees more traffic. There was also diversity in an interesting way, i.e. intersection of Latvians with a persecuted Russian underclass (who are like Dark Elves living in Windhelm&#039;s Grey Quarter) along with some Germans too. Lots of pubs and fun night scene, and on the more touristy side traditional drinks like the Black Balsam. <br>I spent twice as long in Talinn yet it&#039;s Riga that stays in my mind - on one night walk you find so much adventure.<br><br> It *is* also more diverse in the sense of indian and black migrant workers &amp; tourists but you&#039;ll find those in most european cities really, and a more cosmopolitan city should be easier to fit into. <br><br>Latvian women tend to be attractive but slim and patrician - exactly my type. estonian women are more robust, with bigger asses and more admixture from their northern and eastern neighbours. From Riga you also have easy access to Latgalia, beautiful and peaceful cottage country, something like an Eastern European Muskoka but more casual and undeveloped. I am from Canada so I also appreciate Latvia&#039;s hockey culture, which isn&#039;t as big in Estonia. <br>Finally, latitude - Riga is further south than Talinn, which means you get a bit more sunlight in winter and vice versa. In Talinn it never got dark in July - 11pm the sun was shining.",

Maybe it&#039;s because my card got swallowed by an ATM as soon as I arrived, because there are protests in Serbia right now and I was lucky to find an hostel tended by nice Russians but I didn&#039;t get such a bustling vibe in any other city. It&#039;s chaotic but people are friendly despite their frowning Slav faces. Talking about politics with Serbs is a fascinating experience. There are quite a few alternative places to party for cheap, and everyone speaks perfect English. There is a spot to swim at Ada Ciganlija, and the city buses are free. I&#039;m honestly considering moving there, or at the very least coming back for a few weeks later this year.",

It was an old train, the staff was a bit autistic but rather friendly, and I kept drinking beers to try to fall asleep easier.<br><br>I arrived in the morning at Beograd Central, was kinda distracted, withdrew some cash, and I think what happened is that they give you the cash first, then the card back, while in most other countries, they give you the card back first, then the cash. But maybe the ATM just didn&#039;t give me my card back, I don&#039;t know it&#039;s a blur really.<br>Anyway, I went to the city center, bought stuff at a supermarket, and at this point I realized I had no more card.<br><br>So I took a bus back to the station (of course, the first bus I took got me to Novi Beograd instead of the train station), the staff there told me to call the bank in charge of the ATM, talk to the cops who weren&#039;t there or to fuck off. But at least there were power plugs and free wifi.<br>The bank confirmed my card was inside, told me they open the ATM two times a week, but wouldn&#039;t tell me when for security reasons.<br>So I called my domestic bank, I cancelled the card, and they told me I could get either emergency cash, or an emergency card. I chose the emergency card. Someone from VISA called me that night to ask a bunch of questions, band it got delivered to my hostel 48h later.<br><br>It&#039;s a magnetic stripe only debit card, I can&#039;t buy stuff on the internet with it or use ATMs. So to get cash I send money to myself with Western Union, and I ask my family to book FlixBus tickets for me.<br>Thank you for coming to my TED talk.",

The cuisine is really fresh and rustic. The pork knee, duck, sausages, soups, wood fired grills....flawless. There are fantastic pastry shops too. I got hooked on the kronuts. I was shocked at how good the food was in Prague. Every meal I had in Prague was amazing. Look up Kl\u00e1\u0161tern\u00ed \u0161enk on google photos and just go through the photos of the food. Right up my alley. <br><br>The food in Budapest is ok. Not great. The liquor they make is bad. There&#039;s a reason Palinka and Unicum aren&#039;t popular outside of Hungary. The Museums we did in Budapest weren&#039;t nearly as good as the ones in Prague. The Czech National Gallery is HUGE. We got to see the Slav epic in Prague. Mucha locked himself in a barn and worked on it for like 18 years. The architecture in Budapest is probably better. The Hungarian parliament building is on of the coolest buildings I&#039;ve ever seen, but Prague is just a prettier city on the whole.",

You cross over from Czech where you can go out and drink 10 beers for $15 and suddenly you&#039;re paying $6 for one beer or $12 for a cocktail. Food is about double and half as good in Vienna. And there aren&#039;t many deals for hotels or Airbnbs in Vienna. The nightlife is nowhere close to Prague. But Vienna is is pretty amazing for walking around and seeing beautiful architecture and museums. The big park down on the river is great if you&#039;re into biking. There&#039;s a lot of college aged kids out near the university in Vienna if you go in September. 2 days is plenty to do most of the good stuff.",

It also helps dull the minds of high IQ people and thereby keep them content with living in a small town world.

Guess what I&#039;m not going touristing in fucking Cleveland either.<br><br>It&#039;s a great state to live because we are well above average on nearly every category that matters for day-to-day living (hint tacky shit like lowriders isn&#039;t one of them). We&#039;re not #1 on most things, certainly not in tourists destinations, or amazing landmarks. But the lack of tourists are what helps make the state more livable and affordable.<br><br>(all positive measures rapidly deteriorating thanks to what one of the dumbest version of the Democrat party - the DFL - in the country)<br><br>Anyways, our state was primarily colonized by (big, dumb) scandanavian (hill people, with giant fridge like bodies, witch like facial features, and horrible skin)(parenthesis used since they are redundant with being a scandanavinoid). This is why we share a similar fate + living standard to those countries. <br><br>And yes, that smug, know-it-all better than you attitude is from that Scandinavioid descent and something you will find in those countries as well.<br><br>Food? Yah see the Scandinavoids for that. Again, I don&#039;t give a shit about eating out much, so it doesn&#039;t matter to me. Jucy Lucy&#039;s are legit though.

You can be a 40-year old dude who loves to party, drink, and go clubbing.<br>What you can&#039;t be is 40 years old with no friends trying to solo clubs. That makes people wonder why you&#039;re alone, and the answer is that you&#039;re probably trying to go for some young pussy, which automatically makes people think you&#039;re a weirdo, and it&#039;s not like you can argue your case in a fucking night clubs.<br><br>You should also try to hang out with people your age, you&#039;ll look more legit that way. The idea is to either not stand out, or be such an engaging person that you stand out in a positive way. <br><br>But if you&#039;re truly out there just to fuck, it&#039;s either too late or you gotta be extra sneaky.

Once you solve for overpacking the lifestyle becomes much, much easier to manage. Get yourself a good laptop, a cell plan that works extended times abroad, a tablet for second screen/backup device, a good phone (or two) and focus on the hard to replace things.

But the arrangements were worthwhile, and they let us loose a good deal. My mom wants to go back this October for a week in just Rome, to see the canonization, no tour. Gonna wish I could revisit Vieste, or check out any of the places mentioned by OP, but experiencing the city again in weather that hopefully won&#039;t be as sweltering sounds nice.",

The transit system is amazing &amp; also free and it was way cheaper than I anticipated. <br><a href=\"#p2788061\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2788061</a><br>Bratislava is a good day trip, it&#039;s a like 1hr bus ride from the city center and you can come back on a Danube cruise ferry for less than 100 euro. There was a cool restaurant there called Flagship Bratislava that source all their own ingredients, bread and beer from a farm, bakery and brewery they own. Halstatt is also an interesting day trip if you&#039;re into history (it&#039;s the archaeological origin of the Celtic people) but it&#039;s fucking swarmed with Chinks all year round. Budapest is a full on day trip though, you might even want to stay overnight there.<br><a href=\"#p2788557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2788557</a><br>Totally recommended. You won&#039;t run out of shit to do and it&#039;s very lively. Go to the opera, see Klimt&#039;s original paintings, visit the Royal Palace, Freud&#039;s office, the Teutonic Order&#039;s HQ (I think it&#039;s the same building as Mozart&#039;s house), museum of anatomy, the Hapsburg catacombs under the cathedral, visit the Stadtpark to see massive WWII flak towers and have a huge fried pork hock in the park&#039;s outdoor restaurant. There&#039;s also a massive aquarium inside another flak tower to the south but I didn&#039;t visit it. Also book a reservation in the Cafe Central where Trotsky, Lenin, Hitler &amp; Freud all hung out all day at the same time. <br><a href=\"#p2789189\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2789189</a><br>Totally recommend the restaurant in the Stadtpark especially if the weather&#039;s nice. It&#039;s hard to go wrong eating out in Vienna, I don&#039;t think I went to a single shitty restaurant. You gotta try some typical Austrian food in a traditional restaurant, just google one and book a reservation. It&#039;s shocking cheaper/equal to eat out or go drinking than in Spain. If you go at the end of summer there&#039;s a massive Oktoberfest harvest festival where they have a huge party in front of the stage where Hitler announced Austria&#039;s annexation and everyone gets trashed on half-fermented white wine.",

When I got to Puchburg around 11:30am today, all the steam train tickets were booked, so definitely book those ahead of time if you&#039;re interested. They only run on certain days and specific hours.<br><br>I think you really only need a few hours up there unless you are really going to be walking those trails. But it is a nice place to go if you want to beat the Viennese summer heat and enjoy some views.<br><br>If you&#039;re going to a lot of destinations in Vienna and Lower Austria, consider getting a Niederosterreich Card. It&#039;s about 83eur. The Schneegburg Rail up and back down is about 44eur, so it&#039;s worth considering depending on where you go. I was a dumb dumb and went to Melk Abby the day before and didn&#039;t realize that was covered by the card (didn&#039;t buy one until today). 16eur I&#039;ll never see again. Not convinced price was worth it tbqh.<br><br>I&#039;m doing a lot of travel because I&#039;m also trying to make back my Vorteilscard (71eur). I&#039;ve saved about 40eur so far with the discount (50% off regular OBB tickets) for the Puchburg and Melk trips but man, didn&#039;t realize how much rail travel I would have to do to break even.",

Otherwise eating, drinking and shopping are the main appeal.

I&#039;d just suggest going for a walk along any of the main restaurant areas, picking out something interesting and gambling on something that looks unusual. Even then, seemingly &quot;normal food&quot; might get you off guard - like my first day when I ordered french toast (which has peanut butter in it) and coffee (which has tea in it).<br><br>I&#039;d recommend &quot;Australia Dairy Company&quot; (which has nothing to do with Australia) for HK food, although any cha chaan teng is worth trying, and walking around Kowloon in general if you want try cheap international cuisine.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Looking to take some strolls through a former colony and take a step back in time. Where would be the best place for that. </span><br>As an Australian this is a tricky question for me because HK doesn&#039;t feel that different to Sydney with the old British architecture, its pretty common. In my mind, Macau is the place with the &quot;colonial&quot; architecture because its more exotic to me. I&#039;d suggest walking the windy, hilly, streets on HK Island proper and you&#039;ll see the British legacy, intertwined with an older Chinese flair. Also ride a &quot;ding ding&quot;.",

More than anything you&#039;ll see a lot of Filipino workers, especially on their day off on Sundays - they often sell fruit and vegetables on the sides of major walk ways for some pocket money. They were some of the friendlier people I met in HK, often working in hospitality and retail - they like shooting the shit and actually speak English.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Any place to do a &#039;culture exchange&#039; if you know what I mean.</span><br>I did not partake but off the top of my head Port Land st in Mong Kok and Wang Chai in eastern HK Island are meant to be the places - my understanding is that they aren&#039;t what they used to be.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Also is the weather correct?

Yeah it&#039;ll be hot and humid. I&#039;d be more concerned about monsoons than the heat. <br>They have an underground metro you should use. The breeze off the harbour is pleasant too. Also consider sticking to an area with higher elevation if you can. But I mean, so many public spaces and shopping centres are connected through covered walkways you can actually do a fair bit of walking around without even going outdoors.<br><br><a href=\"#p2800359\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2800359</a><br>To add to what this guy said - my experience was that people who have lived in HK will tell you its become repressive and its not a good place to be anymore, but my view is that this is only true for residents... Someone visiting for a brief stint isn&#039;t going to pick up on this at all.",
