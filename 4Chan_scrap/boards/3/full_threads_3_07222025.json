        "com": "<span style=\"font-weight:bold;color:#2074ce;\">FAQ</span><br><br>\n\n<i>1.) &quot;How do I get started in 3D?&quot;</i><br>\nThere are many ways to get started, the quickest way is to actually start with a 3D program. There are many to choose from, such as:<br>\n-3DS Max<br>\n-Cinema 4D<br>\n-Maya<br>\n-Softimage XSI<br>\n-Lightwave<br>\n-Blender 3D (Free!)<br><br>\n\nOnce you obtain one the next step is to start with tutorials. There are many on the net, they range from text and image tutorials to video tutorials. You aren&#039;t going to find a tutorial for everything out there, but most will explain techniques that you need to adapt in order for you to achieve whatever final result you want.<br><br>\n\n\n<i>2.) &quot;Wow! That&#039;s a lot of programs! Which one is best? I heard ______ is best.&quot;</i><br>\nYou heard wrong, there is no one program that is better than the rest, it has and always will be the skill level of the artist. Which program you choose is solely dependent on your own personal taste and which aspect of the 3D industry you want to be involved in.<br>\nMax and Maya are the most hyped and so therefore the most used, they have the most available documentation online. The interfaces have a steep learning curve, but there isn&#039;t any 3D program you can&#039;t learn if you take the time to use it and follow some tutorials. Go with a generalized package, not a specialist one.<br><br>\n\n\n<i>3.) &quot;Whoah, Generalized vs Specialized? How do I know?&quot;<br>\n</i><br>\nA generalised package like Maya, Max, Softimage are packages that let you model, render, animate, texture, and create dynamics all within the same application. They don&#039;t require third party plugins or applications to add another basic feature, like a renderer or animation tools.<br>\nHowever you can get plugins for these apps to enhance their features. There are several Specialized applications out there that cater to a specific skill.<br><br>\n\nAnimation: Motion Builder, Messiah 3D.<br>\nModeling: Modo, Wings3D, Silo 3D<br>\nCAD: Autocad, Sketchup, SolidWorks<br>\nDetailing: Zbrush, Mudbox, 3DCoat<br><br>\n\n\n<i>4.) &quot;Ooooo Zbrush, I see so much awesome shit from that, I&#039;m gonna start there!&quot;\n</i><br>\nNo, you&#039;re getting ahead of yourself. You should start learning about basic modeling and topology before jumping into Zbrush. Zbrush is a great program for advanced users to add detail to their existing models, or to prototype models quickly by sculpting them out.<br>\nIt is not a good idea to get into Zbrush when you&#039;re not very familiar with general 3D concepts<br><br>\n\n\n<i>5) &quot;Ok, I see I&#039;m not very good at this stuff, can you model ______ for me?&quot;\n</i><br>\nNo, anybody with any decent skill on this board does this work for a living or for some kind of gain. Some of those just starting out may pick up the project but don&#039;t expect Miets Meier level of work. You get what you pay for.<br><br>\n\n\n<i>6.) &quot;But it&#039;s too haaaaaaaaard, isn&#039;t there any easy button?&quot;\n</i><br>\nNo, like all things it takes time and effort to master a program, practice makes perfect and playing around with the interface will get the shortcuts ingrained into your muscle memory.<br><br>\n\n\n<i>7.) &quot;So which program is the easiest to learn?&quot;\n</i><br>\nYou shouldn&#039;t learn a program, you should learn techniques. When you master a technique the program becomes nothing more than a tool. As said before Max and Maya have the most documentation but you should look at learning how to model and the right techniques instead of &#039;what button does X&#039;.<br>\nYou can get UI information from the program&#039;s help files. F1 and Google are your friends.<br><br>\n\n\n<i>8.) &quot;So, what do studios look for when hiring if I don&#039;t know program ______ won&#039;t I get turned down?&quot;\n</i><br>\nWhen a studio judges your demo reel and resume they have an order of priority.<br><br>\n\n1-Quality of Work<br>\n2-Versatility<br>\n3-Experience<br>\n4-Program skills<br><br>\n\n\n<i>9.) &quot;So studios don&#039;t care what program I use? Why do they care about versatility?&quot;\n</i><br>\nExcept for Animators who are pretty much exempt from most rules of 3D, most studios want people who can perform multiple tasks instead of just a specialised one. They want modelers who can also texture, they want riggers who can also do dynamics, they want lighters who can also texture. It&#039;s ok to be specialised in one area, but it doesn&#039;t hurt to be versatile, it will always keep you employed.<br><br>\n\nWhen a studio looks at your program skills they do often look to see if you have experience in their preferred in house package, but MANY times you&#039;re going to get a studio that has added their own tools and pipeline so it wouldn&#039;t matter what program you know as long as your skills are good. If you know techniques you can pretty much pickup any 3D package in a matter of days. Of course there are some that are hard set that you know program ________ but for the most part what package you know is not that important (yes even you Blender fags can get a job in a studio if you know good techniques.)<br><br>\n\n\n<i>10.) &quot;What about gaming?&quot;<br>\n</i>What about it?<br><br>\n\n\n<i>11.) &quot;How do I make my own game? How do I program shaders or a video game?&quot;<br>\n</i>This is a 3D board, not a programming board! Do you want to make 3D game assets or do you want to be a programmer?<br><br>\n\n\n<i>12.) &quot;Uhhhh....&quot;<br>\n</i>Exactly.<br>\n\n\n<i>13.) If you want to get into game asset creating, your three primary focus of interests are:<br>\n</i>-Modeling<br>\n-Texturing<br>\n-Animation<br><br>\n\nLow poly modeling is an art in itself, trying to get as much detail with as few polys as possible takes some practice, there is no formula for this. You create a low poly model and use techniques such as good UV textures and normal maps to enhance the look of the model in the game engine.<br><br>\n\nTwo great places to start for game asset creation:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.poopinmymouth.com/tutorial/tutorial.htm\">http://www.poopinmymouth.com/tutori<wbr>al/tutorial.htm</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.gameartisans.org/gamecon/tutorials/tut_3.htm\">http://www.gameartisans.org/gamecon<wbr>/tutorials/tut_3.htm</a><br><br>\n\n\nAnimating for games is pretty much the same as for movies, except that your model has a higher chance of deforming badly and you may not have as much control over your rig. Still the basic concepts of animation will always apply.",

I tried looking up beveling by shader render options but it wasn&#039;t working really, it just added some weird shadow. As for imperfection maps, I downloaded some but non were looking right, which is something related with uv maps if I had to guess. I&#039;ll keep looking for the right one, because most of the maps I found were for very rough metal surfaces, and not quite fitting for a polished gold surface.<br><br><a href=\"#p1014337\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1014337</a><br>I put the model on a very simple background cause I&#039;m more interested in learning how to model watches than general scenes, but I did tried messing up with the background and add a few things as you suggested, a vintage watch advertisement had the watch sitting on a mirror with some blossoms and petals around it, so I tried to mimic that advertisement format.<br><br><a href=\"#p1014343\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1014343</a><br>Some edges beveled, not all of them because it just messes up with the symmetrical shape of the watch, but most of the visible ones at least.

        "com": "Had an incredible breakthrough tonight. I finally figured out a smart way to clump curves together. I was DYING trying to figure this out for WEEKS. All of my ideas involved rotations. First I would align the points, and then rotate them to fit the direction of the curve. I tried a dozen different variations, and they all failed due to one thing: gimbal lock. No matter how sophisticated the rotation method was, I just couldn&#039;t beat gimbal lock. Eventually, I had to face the harsh truth: That no matter what quaternion support blender nodes *claims* to have, the output will always end up in standard euler, not quaternion. Therefore, I will always encounter lock. I had to find another way.<br><br>So I finally put my mind to it, and realized there was a simple solution all along: Lerping. All I really had to do, was get the starting tangent, normal and cross product for each guide curve. Project the root points to each, dot product, and that gives me the relative distances of the root points to the guide curves. And then for each point of the curve, offset by those distances. And voila! Perfectly clumped curves. They don&#039;t gimbal lock, because they&#039;re not rotation based.<br><br>There is one problem however. I made it so that the normals of the clustered curves, rotate in such a way, that the mesh faces perpendicular to the guide curves. I did this because the mesh is flat, and so if they&#039;re all facing one way, then when you look side-on, the clump seems to disappear. So by making them perpendicular to the guide, it mitigates how much you can see though. That much works perfectly, the problem however, is if I try to mix between the regular normals and the perpendicular normals. It creates twists in a few of the strands. Not 100% sure why, but I think it&#039;s because parts of the strands are mixing &quot;over&quot;, and other parts are mixing &quot;under&quot;, so to speak. And the twist is point where it changes from over to under, or under to over.<br><br>Anyway, I&#039;m happy.",

It&#039;s as performant as Blender typically is, when you generate tens of thousands of curves, and give them a 4 sided profile.<br><br>I believe my actual node groups to be fairly efficient. Taking only about 106ms total, in order to generate 17,298 splines in this manner. Though I am only generating the hair within the radius of the guide curves, I&#039;m not generating a full head of hair. Which google tells me that 90,000 hairs is on the sparse side for a human head. I do plan on hitting that target. When the guides and interpolation are done, I&#039;m going to create a &quot;Fill&quot; group, to fill in all the hair that the guides don&#039;t directly touch, and have them interpolate automatically to whatever they&#039;re nearest. So yeah, with a 90,000 spline target, it&#039;s probably going to become slow as fuck.<br><br>So far, I find it more intuitive to use. Which is why I&#039;m endeavoring this at all. The guide curves define the shape of the hair, and they don&#039;t move when you tweak the mesh. Because it&#039;s not UV dependent.<br>It&#039;s probably not going to be a good method for creating real performance hair. Since it&#039;s reliant on the randomness of point distribution to establish where the roots of the hair are. And that *does* change when you tweak the mesh. Which isn&#039;t an issue when you have tens of thousands of strands, it doesn&#039;t matter if the stands move 0.001cm. But if you were to try and work this at a larger scale for say hair cards or something, then it would be really annoying to have the placement of your cards change, every time you tweaked the mesh.",

That&#039;s normally what it looks like without adjustments to the clump dimensions. Just straight cylindrical clumps.<br>Then I enable the interpolator, and it *mostly* disguises the clumping. It&#039;s still a work in progress. But I got the general sketch of the thing down. Working out the issues from here<br><br>I broke out my ever handy voronoi triangulation node. I made that thing like 2-3 years ago, and still find it&#039;s one of my most useful nodes. It&#039;s gotten even better, since I was able to replace a slower component with a simple math node. That optimization made it able to handle a lot more points a lot more quickly. It&#039;s still not a lighting fast node though, because it has to do the dirty job of creating hundreds of thousand of new points. Potentially millions. And when you do that, Blender is going to slow down regardless. Still, I&#039;m super happy with the speed increase.<br><br>The voronoi node makes it so that points can copy data from other points within its &quot;field of vision&quot; so to speak. Like a convex proximity checker. It looks around for neighboring points, and creates copies with shared indices. I call it a &quot;cloud&quot;<br><br>I take the cloud of data, and capture a bunch of attributes, then collapse it back down by deleting the copies. The whole process takes some getting used to. It&#039;s fairly convoluted. But with this method, I can mix a bunch of attributes together, and normalize, and have them come out the other end a perfect blend. In theory. I still have to do the math in order to make it perfect. But functionally, it&#039;s doable.<br><br>Also, I figured out how to prevent curves from interpolating across the parting of hair. A simple trick of getting the dot of the curves normals and the copy curve normals. And any copy with a dot less than 0 gets deleted.<br><br>Anyway, I think I&#039;m going to take a break from this for a few days. It&#039;s taxing.",

For example those leg straps, they were basically duplicated selections of his thighs with a solidify and subdiv so initially they fit perfectly on him but after rigging the leg and then the straps they were moving differently so i had to sculpt them a bit to minimize the damage.

Just came up with certain style I liked by experimenting and applying what I knew. Now I&#039;m playing around with more ideas, but better and with more depth and interest. I think one of approaches I want to try most for the next game is high poly with abstract chunky shapes and NPR smooth shading and minimal palette. Bonus point is: this style highlights that one of appeals of lowpoly is chunky shapes rather than lofi-ness of it. I mean those kinda &quot;exagerrated&quot; cartoonish or abstract shapes are something that gives an impression of lowpoly even though they&#039;re smooth and curved. I&#039;ve actually seen people mistakingly calling similar styles lowpoly even though polycounts are high.",

It runs better with high-poly, You can literally draw hair in 3D space and it&#039;ll generate a mesh (sculpted hair in Blender is a chore), texturing your sculpt is a lot easier, remeshing is a lot easier (vs Vanilla B3d) and I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a lot more. <br>The UI is for Martians though. Genuinely. It&#039;s not a learning curve it&#039;s a cliffside.<br>Blender 4 runs WAY better than before especially in sculpting (still not as good as ZB), and does everything I need it to when combined with Photoshop, so I just stick with it.",

I think it would be an another reason to try to get more into art itself when you&#039;re a 3D character artist.<br><br>It&#039;s only my opinion, but I see a lot of 3D modelers focus a lot on the technical stuff (eg. maintaining perfect topology, making use of the newest technology), but at the same time they lose track of the visuals.<br><br>I think a lot of modelers spend a really long time on the mesh itself, but then rush texturing. They model the face focused on whether they have the appropriate number of loops, but the face itself looking cute or pretty is low priority in their eyes.<br><br>Most models in this thread look really good, but I wonder if maybe this is <a href=\"#p1014792\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1014792</a> &#039;s problem.

It&#039;s fine for the cranium to be a bit more flat on the forehead, but the back is mostly spherical.<br>-I would taper the bottom of the head more.<br>-While the ears align with the brow ridge in reality, anime ears are lower. The top part of the ear needs to align with the middle of the eye. Also while anime ears can be simplified, it&#039;s best to make them as realistic feature-wise as you can because that just adds to the aesthetic look. It&#039;s fine to distort the features, but have them at least. In your screencap, you&#039;re missing the Y shaped bump inside the ear.<br>-For the face area, flat curvature is most important. If you look at anime illustrations you&#039;ll notice that the face itself tends to have as few shadows as possible. While feasible, it&#039;s bad practice to use custom normals as a crutch for this completely. You want as few &quot;small&quot; bumps on the face as you can, and let large curves carry the form.<br>-The eyes are kinda weird being angled like \\/ too. And the eyelashes are kinda weird too, with those round things. Eyelashes should be like spikes.<br>-Also I personally prefer making the mouth as small laterally as possible. If you need to stretch the mouth, you can do it using your rig. But it&#039;s impossible to rig the mouth so that it makes an almost-dot shape from a stretched position while having it work normally (at least in regular linear skinning, not dual quat skinning), without shapekeys, and it&#039;s always best to avoid those IF you can help it.<br>Also I hope you&#039;re using subsurf. If you are, if that is all real geometry in your picture, then you have way too much geo - you can get away with a lot less.",

Needs tweaking for shape depending on what you want, but the topology should be somewhat workable. I don&#039;t make this exact topology every time, I just freehand it every time. My understanding is that you have an outer ring that spirals from the inner middle to the outer bottom, and a Y shaped bump inside the ear. Then you have a hole under the spiral&#039;s inner start, and a bump under the hole. There&#039;s also a &quot;cup&quot; behind the ear where it connects to the head.<br>Well, this is just my take on ears at least. I never studied them too hard to be honest, so I could be a bit wrong. My points are that you should make them separate and connect them later, and that you should just open up some reference and try to freehand the shape. It&#039;s &quot;art&quot;, after all. You could just skip all this and simplify them to your heart&#039;s content, or just texture them instead.",

If the clothes start clipping when you start rigging/skinning the clothes then you can just delete parts of the body underneath afterwards. And if you rig and skin the body itself in advance you can easily copy weights to form fitting clothes as well. At the same time, modeling the body and having to delete parts of it afterwards may feel like wasted effort. But it helps measuring the shape of the clothes if nothing else. Also you can reuse the body later if you&#039;re into cycling personal assets. I mean it&#039;s good practice to do so since 3d allows you to do it and there&#039;s no reason not to. But I for example am extremely stubborn and prefer remaking things I&#039;ve made before every time for every new project. As you can guess, I rarely finish projects because of that.",

So a mask for morphing the face would be nice. Basically redoing the texture because that\u2019s what happens when you change the original model UV. Had to remove the shaders in blender 4.4 because i\u2019m in 4.2 so that it stops lagging. Lastly, if you\u2019re making this dress which is very fluttery then please have the body with two dress, the accessories individually piece and her tail in a natural position like a cat.<br><br>Otherwise I\u2019m never going to finish, your models aren\u2019t recommended for rookie riggers.

Do you intend to use a facial rig or blendshapes? Sounds like you want blendshapes, but can&#039;t you just add a new shape to the body mesh and start editing? By &quot;masking&quot;, do you mean separating the face geometry (like the eyelid area and the mouth area) from the rest of the body for easier editing? Without &quot;custom split normals&quot;, it&#039;d break up the normal smoothing, but I could copy them from the end product by topology and separate the mouth and eyelid areas if you want. Just be aware that editing the geometry won&#039;t change the normals after that point without re-copying the normals again, so this kinda thing is usually done last (if ever).<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mouth problem</span><br>My bad, I forgot the teeth and tongue, sorry.",

If so, those areas ARE undesirably tense because of unavoidable pinching. I say &quot;unavoidable&quot; because it&#039;s literally impossible to redirect edge flow (meaning creating any non-trivial shape like an uncapped cylinder or a plane) without creating either a 5 or 3 polygon pole. Poles with more than 5 quads pinch even worse, which is why it&#039;s best to avoid those entirely. The only ways to slightly mitigate pinching (and the normal smoothing artifact it creates too) while preserving the subdivison modifier are to limit them to flatter areas - which isn&#039;t always possible - or having more dense geometry in that area for more control - which is unwieldy because the whole point of subdivision is having an easy, sparse control cage to work with. You can&#039;t really smooth poles out without collapsing the subdivision modifier or throwing on some kind of smoothing modifier on top.<br>Also, funnily enough, pentagons may slightly alleviate this pinching as well by virtues of: 1. creating less dense geometry, visually diluting the effect and 2. automatically generating the vert at the pole which ends up being smoother than imperfect pole placement from human input, even though it creates the exact same topology as a 5 quad pole. But this is formally &quot;rule of thumb breaking territory&quot; so most people taking what&#039;s just a &quot;guideline rule&quot; too literally will judge you for it.",

The topology is the same, I just made slight alterations like making the chin less pronounced and the nose less protruding and dozens of tiny tweaks like that. I was making the entire thing from scratch, so it&#039;s a given that I&#039;d modify things as I went. I typically make it &quot;mostly right&quot; and then wait until I add materials and hair to fix issues with the face. Here&#039;s how it looks like in the end with a matcap. If I understand correctly, you&#039;re saying that there&#039;s a very pinch-y &quot;V&quot; shape on the upper and lower lip/chin areas? Like, way too sharp? If so, yeah, that was an issue that I modified later. But you still want a smooth &quot;edge&quot; to it, because most non-chibi anime heads have a smooth &quot;edge&quot; there instead of having the mouth area be completely curved from the bottom view. At least that&#039;s the way I make anime heads, so it&#039;s one way to do things if nothing else.<br>If you wanna inspect the mesh yourself but are wary of getting space aids from the attached .blend files in the earlier posts I can give you a gltf or a fbx or whatever.",

Slap some ref as images in the scene, build your model following the ref. The specifics depend on your exact workflow, sculpting or box modeling. Go to the blender general or anime thread or tutorial thread for tuts (including the archive on warosu) because it&#039;s the question that&#039;s been asked a billion times.<br><br>Also rather than specifically character modeling, learn the basic tools, like if you&#039;re gonna box model know how to quickly extrude or add or split faces and all that, if you&#039;re sculpting find a good sculpting tut. Some complain on tuts being timelapses but that&#039;s basically it, if you know the tools the timelapses are gonna give you workflow examples.<br><br>Later, for rigging, it&#039;s a bit different because it&#039;s more akin to programming so there are some real specifics but you&#039;re not there yet (and you can just slap rigify on it and get a passable result, otherwise look up p2designs).<br><br>That being said, for sculpting I started with those:<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irW<wbr>AjPQyYzg<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2_<wbr>uiUEcY7w&amp;list=PLe0O-ypJqvKw6meu68Tl<wbr>U0_motrjcnrva<br><br>and for poly modeling with this (but already knowing the tools): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXD<wbr>wnAIFOHQ",

Taht allows you to use tweakers to make adjustments to the general pose.

Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3\u201d03\u2019 tall and 63.9 pounds, this means they\u2019re large enough to be able handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip, along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it\u2019d be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pok\u00e9mon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick. Ungodly defense stat+high HP pool+Acid Armor means it can take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more[/spoiler]",

Why would you learn to make a doughnut when you could go look at what you actually want to make and learn 90% of what you&#039;d learn with the doughnut plus a lot of domain specific stuff the doughnut tutorial doesn&#039;t teach. There&#039;s a reason why so many people fail to complete it despite it literally being a case of you following exact instructions with no deviation. It&#039;s because 3d modeling programs are confusing to newcomers and you need the motivation to overcome these hurdles if you are to succeed. The doughnut does not provide this, because no one of sound mind gets into 3D modeling to create a doughnut.<br>I&#039;m a relative newcomer to 3d, so I remember well what the doughnut tutorial did for me (jack and shit). Blender Guru and the other popular blender channels did not help at all, if anything they held me back by instilling methods that are not generally applicable and severely limit what you are capable of. I learned far more from an australian chick with 10k subs and a bad microphone box modeling an anime chick than I did from every &quot;model a TANK in LOW POLY in FIVE MINUTES!?!?!?&quot; combined. The doughnut is, at best, a mediocre tutorial teaching you how to move the viewport around and maybe move a few verticies. At worst it is a gateway drug into opening blender once a month, trying to follow a tutorial, and then closing blender again.",

I think you people don&#039;t understand just how many people end up in credits even if a core team is small. for example, if there are voice or music recording sessions, even just the person who confirmed the booking of the room will end up in the credits. this game has things like voice acting in 2 different languages, performance captures, that alone accounts for over 100 credits. the game has also been localized into several languages, and that alone also accounts for another 50 credits. now we have things like porting, QA, marketing, publishing. Very easy to get another 100 names on there through that.<br><br>at its core, the actual game creation was still handled by a relatively small team, but they had access to all the collaborators an AAA studio would have for porting, qa, publishing and marketing.",

I really do suggest vr or monster clay just to side step a lot of the beginner problems because its far FAR more intuitive than non vr sculpting programs.",

Secondly if your simulation runs for 5 hours and then fails you&#039;ve got a stupid fine mesh while the analysis isn&#039;t properly modeled. Try with a VERY coarse mesh first, see if it runs, see if the results make sense; then, when you know it runs, use a finer mesh or, better, add mesh controls on the surfaces and edges you want to see in more detail.<br>If it fails, well I got a whole spreadsheet of errors and failures, full of possible causes and possible solutions, so I can&#039;t help you there without more informations. <br>To be clear, solve time doesn&#039;t mean the simulation is fucked, I had simulation run for 25 hours (it was an entire electric motor for an e-bike) and produce good results, but it all comes down to what you&#039;re analyzing and how you set up the simulation.",

Be mindful about the sleazy trick SW plays on us every time you mess with the model and then go back to the simulation: it may automatically switch the contact between faces you had previously defined to a self-contact, which usually doesn&#039;t work when you have two different bodies. I have wasted DAYS of machine time on this shit, fucking hell. Also, if you&#039;re studying slipping I assume you set a proper friction coefficient, but keep in mind SW doesn&#039;t like very high coefficients, and on the other side of the spectrum it won&#039;t go below 0,05.<br><br>Also, what&#039;s your usual node count?

That&#039;s what probably was happening. Good to know.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;keep in mind SW doesn&#039;t like very high coefficients</span><br>The real coefficient would be at least 0.3, and the max 0.2 sw takes without complaints should&#039;ve been just barely enough in theory (under the assumption of uniform contact pressure - which it isn&#039;t, hence the study) so the idea was that if 0.2 will work then the real thing will work even better.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Also, what&#039;s your usual node count?</span><br>I don&#039;t really pay attention to that. I usually just tune mesh size by feel depending on how much time I&#039;m willing to spend on it. Solution time can vary wildly depending on number of contacts and how well the model behaves after all. The study right now with 750k nodes, with every contact that have to watch out enabled just finished in 4.5 hours. With only essential contacts that move by design it takes 1h 40 min. With everything bonded it finishes in under 7 minutes. I&#039;m running it on i5-12400, in a VM with 24 Gb of ram.<br>When I&#039;m just fiddling with stuff I usually try to keep the solution time under half an hour, and only run longer studies when I want to verify the final design that I&#039;m reasonably sure I won&#039;t have to fix and run again.",

I work in a studio, we have all the softwares so whatever our client has, we can work with it too. I&#039;ve seen CATIA, but never used it. UI is shit, and that&#039;s pretty much all I can say about it. As for the &quot;powerful&quot;, I think it all comes down to handling large assemblies with millions of components and integration with a robust PDM that might set it apart from everything else. As for actually modeling in it, I don&#039;t know, but one of the good thing about SW is that being so widespread there&#039;s always something online that will help you learn or solve a situation, while the same can&#039;t be said about CATIA. In the end all CAD work pretty much the same (more or less). Just today I was reading SW2025 highlights and my impression is that DS is doing basically the absolute bare minimum to keep all these softwares afloat, because SW works like absolute ass, but the features and fixes are so few and far in between to be laughable. Also, unless you work in some massive corporation that does massive projects it&#039;s infinitely more likely for you to encounter SW than CATIA.",

However:<br>At a beginner&#039;s level, one of my kids is doing DT at school and there&#039;s some useful, simple design stuff in the exam revision guides you can buy from book stores.<br><br>CAD: FreeCAD and Solid Edge Community Ed are free (certain restrictions on SE). Also openSCAD, which I haven&#039;t used and Tinkercad<br>Fusion 360 and Onshape have or had free plans.<br>Solidworks has a makers edition which is apparently a PITA with embedded cloud shit. Shame as I use it at work and it is pretty good for what I do.<br><br>Some of the packages (Solidworks particularly) have okay built-in tutorials and there are loads of specific examples of functions on YouTube.<br>One good way of learning is to pick something you have lying around and just start modelling it. Begin with something simple and then increase difficulty. As a guide, blocky stuff like door hinges is easy, organic stuff like detergent bottles is hard. Moving on to take things apart for really in depth modelling will probably teach you more about how things go together than a bunch of books.<br><br>3DP: there used to be some best practice guides for FDM available from Stratasys, particularly &quot;FDM for end use parts&quot;. Not sure if this has been wiped or stuck behind a registration form now. Simplify3d had a good guide to print settings. <br>Reddit&#039;s r/3dprinting &quot;getting started&quot; wiki has useful bits in it, though usual reddit caveats apply.<br>There&#039;s useful info at hubs dot com resources pages.<br><br>Phonefagging so formatting and speling may be a bit wonky.",

That said, I came across good jeet channels, try watching a few videos and decide by yourself what you like best.<br>Keep in mind that once you grasp the core concepts of parametric 3D CAD (volume generation from 2D, volume addition and subtraction, the feature tree and its order of operation), it all boils down to knowing the advanced tools, keyboard shortcuts, and overall knowledge of the specific software peculiarities.<br><br>As for furniture, it depends: in principle you can do anything, but parametric software like SW aren&#039;t the best for flowy surfaces, like pic related. I mean: it can be done but it will be time consuming and painful. For basic shit like cabinets, shelves, and tables it&#039;s perfectly adequate.",

My workflow right now is like this: I draw a master sketch where I dimension all the geometry (simplified using lines and triangles of course) and fix hinge points for movable parts in some eyeballed default position, then draw another sketch where I duplicate the moving parts and use external equal and coincident relations to the master sketch to dimension and fix them properly in hinges and then use some characteristic dimension (like suspension compression height in case of vehicle suspension) or just leave it underdefined to move it to a different position and see if it performs as expected and doesn&#039;t do anything weird. I make several of these sketches in different positions then I adjust the master model with movable sketches following the changes to dimensions and hinge geometry while keeping their respective different positions thanks to being related to the master sketch until I&#039;m satisfied with it and can move on to drawing the actual physical parts. For something simple I actually draw all the relevant geometry within the same sketch several times in different positions and then with the right constraints SW automagically derives the proper geometry, but it becomes overcluttered really fast (pic related) and also there seems to be some sort of hardcoded calculation time or complexity limit where SW would just throw the towel and mark everything red as unsolvable even though you can still fiddle it in place manually (until the next tiny change or even just rebuild where it blows up again). So for more complex stuff several identical sketches all related to the main sketch, just with one or few dimensions adjusted later become a necessity.",

You can do it in assembly if you copy-paste several copies of the same part that contains the master sketch, set the copies to different configurations, and derive sketches from each of them.

I have no idea how to get another ball to sit in the goove at another point without forcing it. I hope to find a way that will let me undo the unnatural constraint of the first ball to the sketches vertex. I&#039;m okay with constraining to the groove face, groove edge, sketch.",

Normally I like to start by studying my subject of interest by drawing because it helps me internalize the various contours, proportions, and details, but then I typically model without reference. I don\u2019t do that on purpose most of the time, I just forget that references are something I can use when modeling, but I did make image planes for the first model, and that\u2019s probably why it looks better than the others. Modeling without a reference can make a project take a while to complete, but sometimes taking a while can be a good thing, at least for the design of something. Nora in particular took me a span of 8 months to complete, but a lot of that time was spent not working on the model, then coming back to it and working out the kinks with a fresh eye.<br>The other part of it is about having well-developed creative muscles. I spent much of my youth playing with legos and doing origami, and both of those things help develop a sense of how to go about the creative process, and also develop the senses for shapes, proportions, and colors that look nice. Lego minifigures and MMORPGs with good character customization also helped develop my senses for character design specifically. Minecraft was also something I spent a lot of time on during my teenage years, and that was really good for architecture, environments, and atmosphere. What you pull inspiration from is also important, like with the media I listed in my previous reply.",

I stumbled upon a philosophical YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9A<wbr>7GTGSfrIU) a while back about the archetypes of the puer aeternus (boy eternal) - a boy who was never forced to grow up and has a bright imagination because of it, but typically lacks the ability to actualize his imagination because he refuses to engage with the real world, and the senex (old man) - a man who was forced to grow up too early, and hence had his imagination and spirituality crushed by his sense of practicality and duty. I suffer from the first archetype and have been trying to build myself over the past few years, and I think you may suffer from the second and could benefit from watching that video. These philosophical ideas do play a part in what I create. I\u2019ve always found great joy in creative play, and I hate how sterile and practical the world is today. Everyone is overconcerned about being \u201cright\u201d, or doing things \u201cthe right way\u201d that it squeezes the fun out of things. The world was more interesting when people believed in fairies and dragons and stuff like that, and that\u2019s why I love shows like Ancient Aliens even though most of what they say in that show is dumb bullshit.<br><br>Pic related is something I had to make for a project back in high school. I don\u2019t know what he is, but he\u2019s ready for battle.",

Another thing is that on boards like this one and /ic/, people (this usually includes myself) will refrain from attaching their work to their opinions since saying the wrong thing can result in someone obsessing over them and harassing them one-sidedly for an extended period of time, even over fairly inoffensive statements.

Most female animals don\u2019t breed with one \u201cplant\u201d in particular, and some animals do also have a male counterpart that is capable of moving.<br>During human prehistory, some Chi Wara settled on the Earth and taught humans agriculture and how to build civilizations.<br>Because of the way Chi Wara reproduce, they\u2019re compatible with many different types of semen, including human semen, so some of the Chi Wara integrated into human society and eventually evolved into Amazons due to selective pressures.<br>The Elves are the descendants of the Chi Wara that decided to isolate themselves from the Earthly races, and ultimately went down a different evolutionary path, keeping some of their Chi Waran features while also adapting to the Earth\u2019s environment. The Elves reproduce almost exclusively using the semen-producing crops they brought to the Earth ages ago since they consider it taboo to do otherwise, and this severely handicaps their population growth since those crops don\u2019t grow well in the Earthen soil. The Elves scorn their sister race for their breeding with the Humans and think that the Earth men would be better off like plants. Most of the races on the Earth dislike the Elves, but their retention of the magical prowess of their Chi Waran ancestors is what prevents them from being wiped out.<br>None of this is the plot to any of the projects I have planned, just expository information. The \u201cEarth\u201d in this setting is just a fantasy parallel to the real Earth.",

Obviously I removed her breasts, but with her powers she would have the ability to stretch them out and squeeze them back in at will, like those cartoon characters that try to push their gut in and all of that mass goes to their feet or something, but with her it would go to her thighs/butt of course.<br><br><a href=\"#p1014513\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1014513</a><br>That\u2019s actually a pretty good adjustment.

This is from a scene I\u2019ve been trying to get finished, but my progress came to a halt because Bosequias is a part of it and I haven\u2019t finished him yet.<br>I partially created this thread because I wasn\u2019t quite in the mood to do any 3d modeling at the moment, so I\u2019ve mostly been doing origami, drawing, and I even coded again for the first time in 3 weeks. So of course, I haven\u2019t gotten much 3d work done.<br><br><a href=\"#p1014637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1014637</a><br>It had been a while since I worked on that scene, but the simplicity of the lighting surprised me when I opened it back up to investigate. I used a sun light to create the sharp sunspots on the floor, then I used some point lights in the middle of the windows for something that has falloff while also intensifying the light around the windows themselves. I don\u2019t believe I did much else with it.<br>Sometimes when I create scenes I do it to get simple ideas out of my head, and some of these ideas even come from my dreams. I guess it\u2019s a way of cataloging my ideas so I can use some of them later when I go and finally design a game world.",

Click beetles aren\u2019t known to damage things or carry diseases, so I don\u2019t mind them being around. Plus they\u2019re fun.<br>I had to dig through scientific papers to figure out how to model one of these guys since there doesn\u2019t seem to be many artistic resources for beetle anatomy, let alone click beetle anatomy. I was planning on eventually making a new one since I have a few click beetle carcasses sealed away in ziploc bags that I can study.<br>I had an idea for another character that had an upwards-facing beetle as a head, and the beetle&#039;s elytra were shaped like a mask.",

Is the game going to be some sort of lewd-game</span><br>My intention isn\u2019t necessarily to create a lewd game, but rather a crude game, or at least a weird one. With my interest in history, I have always had a liking for artifacts and artwork from foreign and primitive cultures, and I\u2019m fascinated by how these artifacts can range wildly from possessing a very strange and alien sense of beauty, all the way to a profound level of ugliness and obscenity, and even a sense of terror that you don\u2019t see anywhere else. Sub-Saharan artwork is one of my favorites because of how intensely it exhibits these qualities. Because these come from cultures that differ from ours, they have different ideas of what is socially acceptable, and the casual depiction of genitals is common. That combination of the erotic and the grotesque is something that gets my blood flowing, as it fills me with an indescribable emotion like no other. To summarize, I am just a genuine weirdo, and that\u2019s why Bosequias has his cock and balls out.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In my scenes the light always looks super flat, like there is no air/atmosphere whatsoever</span><br>I\u2019m probably not the best person to go to for lighting advice because the way I set up my lighting can be rather haphazard, but the thing that helps me the most is having a sense of mood for the scene I want to create. I ask myself how I want to feel if I were in the environment I\u2019m creating. What would make this scene emotionally or aesthetically impactful? A lot of the time when I\u2019m out and about, if I\u2019m in a place that feels nice to be in, I will take note of what color the lighting is and where it\u2019s coming from. It\u2019s more of a subconscious process, but observing effective lighting (not necessarily good lighting) can help develop the senses.",

The sub-saharan influence is certainly visible in your works. It&#039;s a rather uncommon interest and choice of style nowadays, but the more it evokes curiosity.

Lately I have started to be more mindful and observing when it comes to the atmosphere of places I am visiting. Places that have some sort of emotional impact on myself.

But at the same time there is the technical aspect - I certainly need more experience with Blender and its tools/settings to achieve the results I envision.

I played Split Fiction recently with an NPC who kept repeating that it&#039;s &quot;GOAT&quot; game or whatever, &quot;GOTY&quot;, it had 2 characters that have no looks of a woman, no shape no curves no ass no waist no hips no boobs, nothing, and one of them had a cryptokike nose. The worst part wasn&#039;t that, it&#039;s that it was linear as shit, no exploration, nothing to do, just &quot;a-b a-b&quot; constantly. If this is what people think is &quot;good&quot; gaming, then let it get more pajeets and AI, it&#039;s not like the game I like are coming back in my lifetime, might as well give people more slop right?",

Of course, most games nowadays just use motion capture for everything, but I&#039;m still of the opinion that animations made by hand such as all the animations in Fumito Ueda&#039;s games have a special something about them that mocap cannot reach. And these aren&#039;t super stylized or cartoony animations either. They&#039;re grounded and realistic but have a lightness to them. I was trying to find resources on how to learn to animate like that, but it seems like a lost art. There are blender courses for animation out there such as the &quot;Alive!&quot; by P2D Design academy, but they all focus on they all focus on this over the top bouncy Disney style. Pretty much all across western animation courses.",

Blender is very versatile and its great for exploring the world of 3D until you find something specific you want to go in depth (like modeling, texturing, sculpting, animating, VX etc.).<br><br>If you are looking for animations specifically, Blender is totally capable of it, though its often described as lacking and hard to get into.

Of course the software can make certain tasks easier and achieve better results out of the box, if we e.g. think about photo-realistic rendering. But at the end of the day, if the user has experience and knows what he is doing, he can easily achieve the same or even better results than the average user of &quot;professional&quot; software.<br><br>Personally, I have found that using blender allowed to deep dive into CGI and overall become a better artist. Compared to other software, blender does certain tasks a bit worse and requires workarounds. But this is were the learning begins. Because now you have to find solutions to problems and understand how things actually work, instead of just mindlessly press a button and rely too much on the tools of a software. Just to name an example, in C4D lofting curves is very easy. If you have a path with 90\u00b0 angles and a profile curves, the corners stay even as you would expect. Now in blender (especially when you use geometry nodes) the behaviour is different and the corners are being averaged out on a 3D path, which leads to distortions. To fix this, it requires understanding vector math. Knowledge, that once you have gained it, you can apply on so many other things. Similar appliances with rendering, shading nodes etc. <br><br>Blender is a totally capable software and does allow to do ANYTHING. This is why it&#039;s one of my favorite pieces of software. And it&#039;s absolutely free on top of that and keeps getting better with each season. I really don&#039;t understand how people can complain about Blender, unless those are some trolls paid by Maya/3DS/C4D etc. to ruin blenders reputation.",

We have an abroad team who is using Cinema 4D and Substance as their main tools and recently Blender was introduced to us too (like a year ago or so). Blender allowed us to do certain tasks not only much cheaper, but also easier and faster due to its open source and procedural nature. We were able to automate certain daily tasks and processes that previously were impossible or would required large investments into Cinema 4D through plugins, licenses etc. The tasks that required the C4D team days, is now being completed within minutes in Blender and it has been welcomed with open arms since. The render quality was initially much better with Octane Renderer with C4D, but as we gained more experience with Blender and Cycles, the difference in quality is barely existent. So, from the POV of an employee working in visuals and actually generating money, I am not sure what the discussion here is about. Blender is a great tool and opened so many new doors for us in terms of efficiency both in time and money. Significantly.",

If someone is interested but not sure whether it is worth learning blender, I can definitely recommend it. It may be not the industrial standard, but it&#039;s being adapted and implemented in many production workflows. I can&#039;t speak for artistic works like short movies, character creations, rigging, complex animations etc., but for product shots and bulk production it&#039;s great and I hope to see more from the developer team. Good luck on your 3D journey.",

But after experimenting with them a lot, I see the limitations they have in Blender&#039;s shader nodes. I think to actually unlock the full potential of SDFs, you need to code them.

N64 mario and a character from MGS Peace Walker are both considered low poly, but the later has at least twice the tris.<br><br>If you&#039;re trying to replicate the visuals of a particular game / era, go download some of its models and aim for similar number of polys.

That way you won&#039;t get those pixellized staircases on the lines. Yes, unfortunately that means no easy viewport texture painting. Also most people would prefer setting the texture sampling to closest/nearest rather than linear so you get clean square pixels instead of being washed out like that, it&#039;d visually fit the sharp outlines better.",

But it wasn&#039;t really needed, and I don&#039;t think it translated well. I won&#039;t bother going that small next time around, I won&#039;t ever need it anyway.

It&#039;s not easy to understand if you need a paid course or not, it will be easier when you know more. I bought two courses so far, first was spot on and second is kinda technically good but it&#039;s outside of my area of focus (it&#039;s general materials course, but all they do is fucking photorealism) which made it incredibly boring for me and I dropped it real quick. I just can&#039;t watch it, I&#039;m falling asleep.

It adds a lot of time to my workflow, but I can get those perfect laid out squared UVs i&#039;ve seen them japanese folk make with their video game models. I wouldn&#039;t use the method I figured out for anything else other than low poly or at least until I figure out a python script to stream line it.",

Im under the impression that your fingere need to be just above halfway to the femur. With her slight arm extention, that could make her arms appear short. perhaps her legs being long is making them appear short?<br>Idk, but a visual aid would be welcome.<br><a href=\"#p1013076\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1013076</a><br>I stumbled upon it recently while working on this model. I havent worked out all the pros and cons, or pitfalls, of what it is that i did exactly. It also helps that your model is already made with solid quads, but basically:<br><br>1. Analyze the Model:<br>Count how many faces are in each row of the mesh section you want to unwrap (e.g., chest: 4, 8, 10...). Say the neck is 4 faces in a row, next row is 8, next couple of rows after is 10.<br><br><br>2. Build a Flat Proxy Plane:<br>Create a flat plane with matching face layout using those counts. Say the chest is a solid 4x4 of faces. make a 4x4 plane.<br><br><br>3. UV Snapshot:<br>Since it\u2019s flat, the UVs are perfectly square. Export a snapshot for texture painting.<br><br><br>4. Paint the Texture:<br>Use Photoshop or similar tools to draw clean details directly on the square grid.<br><br><br>5. Wrap the Plane to the Model:<br>Manually move the proxy\u2019s vertices to match the original model\u2019s shape \u2014 face by face. Vert by vert.<br><br><br>6. Replace the Old Geometry:<br>Delete the original faces. Your new geometry keeps the clean UVs and fits the model.<br><br>optional 7th step: After was all said and done, i had to adjust the uv a bit here and there due to some minor distortion.<br>---<br><br>This method is ideal for lowpoly to midpoly since there arent many verts and faces you have to count and match to the model. Still adds time to your workflow though.<br><br>Its dumb, but it worked.",

You need to go back to the way it was done in the 90s. A small handful of guys all doing different parts, making a game together in their spare time for free. At least these days you have the benefit of crowdfunding once you produce something resembling a proof of concept. If you&#039;re not willing to treat game development as the craft it is and rely on corporations to make use of that talent of yours instead of forming your own small team you only have yourself to blame. Corporations are not to be trusted or relied on when it comes to developing a game.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The jobs aren&#039;t coming back and AI is going to take over this field.</span><br>And on the other side of things, AI will never be able to do high quality models any time soon. 3D artists still have time, they need to just get off the corporate teat and form your own group. It&#039;s easier for actual modelers to form such a group than the &quot;idea guys&quot; can since the &quot;idea guy&quot; pool is tainted by the fact that 95% of idea guys have shit ideas and no one wants to even try to find the remaining 5%.",

The models are clearly stolen from MMD creators because you can see the waving cloth being thrown around. Special effects are rated 0/100, they should be blamed for it but Blender can\u2019t do special effects like 3DMax. Still their planning for car fight scenes are not entertaining enough. The audience will always notice the unbroken cars. The editors did poorly as each shot kept moving faster than normal view. I suspect this is the studio production issue rather then editing team because Blender is known to never render longer scenes. Anime rendering is not helping their work, they clearly don\u2019t understand lighting, too much blank one light. Darker shadows aren\u2019t shown thus they can\u2019t understand the light scenes that people expect.<br><br>As for animation, also zero out of hundred. They stay still within the car, never moving when car is moving, bad face poses, unrealistic expectations like two people fitting a car seat, eye movements are rare and too much reliance on camera to hide issues of animation.<br><br>This is by far the worst MMD video i have ever watched. They clearly did it for the money because it was Wuthering Waves who sponsored them.",

Good animations have both large exaggerated movements, but also smaller, more detailed and subtler animation as well. Arcane is a good example of this. The fight scenes are very dynamic, but when the show wants to, it&#039;s amazing at showing subtler facial expressions.",

All you need is a 24GB VRAM nvidia GPU, and something like this is very simple to do using WanVideo2, with the only cost being electricity, which is negligible, considering the load is no different from rendering frames on a 3D application.

If you can afford the upcoming recently leaked 96GB RTX 6000 PRO, you can do even higher res/framerate/longer content. Of course that&#039;s probably going to cost around 10k at least. Right now these things don&#039;t support multi gpu setups properly, so a high VRAM single GPU is required. Or at least I&#039;m not aware of any way to combine VRAM for this purpose at this time. You can offload some secondary stuff to a second GPU, which does help offset some of the load on your main GPU, but the video model itself can be only loaded on a single one.",

That&#039;s because, as you said, these things only serve to create things for your own consumption.<br>But the more control you have, the more your personality will be reflected in the end result.

If AI can create great model from just writing &quot;sci-fi monster model, symetrical&quot; into the prompt box, it wont matter if you spend 20 hours on some workflow of back and fourth feedback with the AI, because tot he end user it will still be the same. I as a consumer or audience when I see AI generated model, I have no idea how much personality is in the 3D model because I cant tell if the model was made with 3 word prompt and every creative decision was just some median algorithmic mush shifted around by random seed value, or if it was made by the prompter, and if some nigger decided to just post 300 models a day all from 3 word prompts I would have no reason to be charitable to AI 3D models to be made with personality instead of just being done all by AI. Before AI if you made art it was either amazing and you put lot of yourself into it, you edited a model/traced which some people could tell, or you made a bad art, but the detail and beauty was generally proportional to the amount that you cared, or it was result of some formulaic method people learned from someone. Now its all gone and people are disinterested in AI stuff, but the more AI starts slipping into the content that people can tell is not AI, the less people will care about that content in general.",

Maybe AI will become ubiquitous and consumers will start using more sophisticated ways of identifying styles and authorship, or maybe we&#039;ll live in a reality where people will start valuing genuine things and any production with any evidence that it was made with the help of AI will be perceived as something lesser and worthless.",

Intention is the create a puppet dude I can put customize and create accessories for (which I can also use hunyuan to acquire base meshes to start from)<br><br>Left AI, Right is my version (so far)<br><br>My only real issue is the legality of any financially successful creative work done with this, as Hunyuan offers only a non-commercial license for these base meshes and legally speaking I believe it could be considered a derivative work, even if you make the model look different by changing all the proportions. But the endgame is being able to confidently make my own models without AI as a home base to swing from, as I&#039;ve had to learn a lot to be able to recreate this effectively",

Do you really think 3D objects will pass the slop eye test that many internet users (main customers) will not notice? To this day 3D AI is still bunch of vertex blobs with blurry textures, if you dont believe me go on Hunyun or whatever the Chinese website is, or meshy to see for yourself. There will be years if not forever until it starts making something that wont look AI. Sure it will not look like current AI, but it will have its quirks that current Imagegen models have, some kind of unknown uncannyness that you immediately notice when you zoom in. Not to mention AI is nowhere near solving topology outside of using old methods like Z brush remesh",

I urge some of the anons here that are worried about it developing really fast to look at what the models were capable of in late 2023 and compare it to what we have now, and I really mean late 2023, not the first image to 3D research papers. For example this model I took from some discord server back in novermber of 2023. Yes, it is coming but not as fast as some anons here predict, and it is basically guaranteed at this point that we reach AGI within the next 20 years or humanity goes extinct.",

It\u2019s one thing on boards like /v/, /b/, and whatever else, but creative boards like this one are more personal, especially when they\u2019re small and slow. Some people treat these types of boards like the various shitposting boards they browse, I would imagine because they don\u2019t post their work here, or don\u2019t even have any work to post. Of course none of these posts are my own work, but it always helps to keep the vibe of the board friendly.",

You tried, weren&#039;t good at it, and then threw your hands up and effectively gave up.<br>It&#039;s a part of having autism. Unironically though, not as like some random insult. This is a thing autistic people do where they wallow in their own inability and self-sabotage by only giving half attempts at the thing they&#039;re not actually that interested in, and wondering why they can&#039;t improve. It&#039;s the same reason you &quot;Can&#039;t&quot; roleplay, or write, or do any of those things you wanna do.<br><br>You have separated the idea of effort getting results, and find a bit of comfort in just declaring that you can&#039;t do something because it&#039;s better than the alternative, which is acknowledging that the amount of effort you thought was acceptable for improving, wasn&#039;t actually enough.<br><br>The actual way to improve is to press yourself and draw/RP/etc, better today than you did yesterday, and you keep doing that until you actually improve. Not just, &quot;Do as good as you can&quot; and then rage about it online for the rest of the day.<br><br>It&#039;s probably time you abandon this knee jerk habit of being mad that you&#039;re not making fantastical art and great RPs out the gate, and either actually try, or stop dwelling on it and go do what you&#039;re actually interested in.

It\u2019s so frustrating how much better the Blender tutorials are on YouTube though. Most of the Maya tutorials are done by pajeets with awful microphones and bad instructions. Does anyone know of any channels that have higher quality stuff in regards to Maya? So far GameDevAcademy&#039;s 4 hour intro video has been really good but I&#039;m struggling to find more of that level of quality.",

Have you started making any shorts or are you still in a planning/prototyping phase?<br><br>2. You say you &quot;can&#039;t afford to experiment&quot;. Why? Are you planning on pulling some kind of profit from this? If not then I&#039;d really encourage experimenting. It could result in something great, or it could result in something that sucks, but it will probably be interesting in either case. Just chasing the trend risks making something boring. Not to say that you should throw out the whole femcel thing altogether, just try and put a twist on it.<br><br>3. What software is this <br><br>4. How long is a &quot;short&quot;? 2-5 minutes?

Fast forward, and now digital art is everywhere, and guess what? It\u2019s filled with just as much passion and creativity as any other medium but sure, let\u2019s pretend history is not repeating itself. Let\u2019s ignore the fact that AI, like any other tool, is only as soulless as the person using it. If someone lacks creativity, no amount of AI is going to fix that. And if someone actually has talent, AI isn&#039;t going to erase OP vision it just another tool to speed up the tedious parts so he can focus on the stuff that actually matters at the end of the day, people have two choices: adapt and evolve, or get left behind clinging to outdated purity tests.

Here&#039;s the latest picture from that account. Niji itself still fucks up fingers and similar minor detail every so often, people just re-prompt, ask to fix certain regions, or even fix that manually with sometimes quite impressive results. And there are no reasons to believe those models won&#039;t get even better in nearby future. Big things are coming to generative 3d AI as well, I&#039;ve seen a Blender addon recently that introduces node-based stuff to utilize AI. There are artists with decades of experience that look at AI as a tool to improve their workflows instead of just dismissing it as uNfAiR and NoT tRuE aRt like you do. Now guess who will win if you are given the same amount of time to do a certain project. Another point, the amount of insignificant grindy work is titanic in fields like animation and 3d, are you going to avoid AI even for that? Like, you seriously consider working out the seams, UV unwrapping or adding minor scratches over your logs or whatever as extremely important things to be done manually to make your work true art?",

It generally looks good but everyone shits on it in part because the original fans have aged out of it and it&#039;s no longer meant for them, and in part because of simple groupthink. Right is objectively better than left- I can&#039;t tell what the facial expression on the left is supposed to convey at all, it looks like someone just rotated the jaw controller straight down on x and called it a day. His tongue has no wetness to it and the 2d bump mapping on his skin/the way the light hits his lips looks totally off and kind of uncanny the longer you look at it. It was good art direction for what was available in 2001 but it&#039;s unironically the current year. 4chan in particular doubles down on it&#039;s negativity towards it because they added a character who in spite of being green has some sort of nonwhite aura about her that&#039;s a bit hard to quantify. <br><br>They overdid the aging on Fiona, the teeth are very excessive.",

You can try, but you&#039;ll end up with a a messy model with terrible shading, that has way too many polygons, and is a pain in the ass to weight paint or UV. So instead of trying to create topology for every little wrinkle, people resort to normal maps to fake those wrinkles. Because the details are so small, you can manipulate light to create the illusion of wrinkles along the flat surface, and nobody will be the wiser. This light manipulating element is call &quot;normals&quot;.<br><br>By changing the normals, you change how light reacts to the surface. You can paint normals using various methods. They work similar to textures. If you can texture, then you can make normal maps. So no, you don&#039;t need to learn sculpting to get all of those fine details. You just have to learn how to paint normals.<br><br>That being said, a lot of people find it easier to sculpt wrinkles into the mesh itself, and then &quot;bake&quot; those wrinkles into a normal map. Then apply the baked normals on a retopologized version of the model. It&#039;s a different path to arrive at same destination. If you think your normal paintings can match or exceed sculpted and baked normals, then you don&#039;t really have much to worry about.",

I googled and lurked here for a while and came up with this workflow to create assets. I&#039;d appreciate any feedback from anons with experience so I don&#039;t blindly waste my time learning suboptimal tools.<br><br>My use case will be creating and animating assets for my game. I will use Vroid for humanoids, model and sculpt environment assets, and sculpt monsters. Animations would be basic game animations and some cutscenes (short and not too complex). The style will be stylized pbr (similar to genshin, wuva). <br><br>With regards to sculpting, would I be able to do everything with blender. I have hard surface modelling experience, but never sculpted before. I&#039;m following Modeng&#039;s Artstation course, where he uses Zbrush to finalise environment assets made in Blender. I&#039;m also sculpting monsters and other creatures I can&#039;t make in vroid. I would like to know whether this can be done in Blender or if ZBrush would be better.<br><br>I know some anons say that Maya/ 3ds is easier for animating, but since I&#039;m making short animations (movement, attacks, idle, interactions), can I get away with it? I hate autodesk and would prefer not to give them money. I don&#039;t plan to work in this field, so I don&#039;t have to follow an industry standard, just a good workflow to make my games.<br><br>Thanks.",

I&#039;d wager most of the time you&#039;ve spent doing pipeline theorizing could have been better spent actually doing proof-of-concepts, understanding what does and doesn&#039;t work instead of just being told something. Maybe you&#039;ve already done that, but from your post it doesn&#039;t sound like it. Every program sucks. That&#039;s why people defend their choice like it&#039;s their identity on this board.",

I think Artstation might be the next bet though, since they have a 3d viewer alongside their other upload options, but I think they&#039;re also part of the FAG-gots. Technically you can still upload to Sketchfab and put things up under a free license if you want people to download. There&#039;s also the SFW version of Smutbase if you&#039;re desperate, Open3dLab, but that seems like a lot of just model rips and stuff.<br><br>Twitter is also full of faggots, but I&#039;d also agree with others and say to post there if I were you. That, or Instagram if you&#039;re looking for the general public to see your shit. Anywhere else is just going to be other artists jerking themselves off, and giving you thinly veiled compliments that are more of a &quot;come look at my shit&quot; than anything actually useful. If you&#039;re out there genuinely looking for critiques, best bet is really a forum, some faggot discord filled with begginers, Reddit (if you must), or god-forbid here on /3/.<br><br>But yeah, there used to be good places for the shit you&#039;re asking, but the internet gets shittier and shittier everyday and places like that are dropping off or getting merged into shit like FAB (FAG).

Beziers are still good for making pipes or otherwise curving a surface non-destructively (lattices in Blender). NURBS are kinda redundant with sub-d unless I&#039;m missing something. Some people use sculpting for hard surfaces for whatever reason, but I still find booleans + manual cleanup to be the most reliable way to get the desired shape.<br>Really just go follow a bunch of modeling tutorials and figure out what works best for you.",

Here&#039;s my take:<br>1) You have to know the AI and how to use it. AI can only get better from here. Like with all other revolutionary technologies in the past, everyone either adopted the tech (some sooner, some later) or failed to compete and lost.<br>2) Focus on complementary skills to the AI: Find out where the current AI fails and focus on those skillsets. If AI does something exceptionally well, it should be a low priority.<br>Think of AI as a tool - the most awesome goddamned tool of this century. The time is coming soon when we either have to adapt to it or lose to it.",

AI is not a tool, it&#039;s a replacement. There&#039;s no &quot;using&quot; fucking AI because it&#039;s a replacement advertised specifically so. It&#039;s marketed to non creators who want content to consume and corporations who want to save money. It&#039;s not for the creators. <br><br>&quot;Learn AI&quot;. What a fucking joke lmao, as if prompting will be a real job or even relevant enough. The point is to cut costs but cutting labor. That means massive amount of job loss, that means a hyper competitive industry shrinks even more. There&#039;s no room for the creator to &quot;adapt to AI&quot;, it automates the process. Either it isn&#039;t as good as these people are saying and it&#039;s useless, or it will continue to get better rapidly to the point you aren&#039;t needed in the pipeline. 3D thankfully is safer from this because there isn&#039;t enough data like there is with 2D images to train it. But I don&#039;t imagine in 20-30 years anything that can be done on a computer will still be done by humans.",

Image AIs are only used by no-draws and the small artefacts or just the way the colors and contrast work give it away eventhough it was worked on for so long and has so much time to improve, and like predicted once people get over the novelty, they came to see all AI content indiscriminately as slop. Even if it looks objectively good regardless of the tiny artefacts, the moment your brain notices that artefact and registers it as AI picture it will become slop in most people&#039;s minds, and same will happen with these models. So look at what 2D AI has done and expect similar to take shape in 3D, maybe with some more caveats because it still cant do good rig or anything.<br><br>Overall what I am trying to say is that this will most likely be used by cheap motherfuckers making slop, or used to make background stock models like 2D was used for making textures and stock videos. It will cause a lot of people to lose jobs, and make the market more competitive, but it wont kill it outright, just like it didnt kill drawing and how NSFW artists still make pretty much the same money on Patreon as they did before AI, despite there being infinite cheap AI porn.",

You can tell it the logic and what you expect, then read its output and fix the stupid stuff it does. It&#039;s only beneficial to people who already know how to code, because newbs use it do all their uni assignments and never learn to code. They can&#039;t recognise bad code or how to debug their errors, so their skill cap is the AI&#039;s skill cap.

Anyway, I say -esk because the painting workflow is the same I&#039;m just using higher res textures (512 instead of 256) but with a generally lower poly count (my faces are static for instance since). I&#039;ve studied a ton of PS2 models over the years, specifically from Rockstar Games and from games like Def Jam: Fight For New York which has AMAZING looking characters.<br><br>Anyway, I&#039;m not that great at painting yet but the advice I can give is definitely use something like 3Dcoat for texturing. I&#039;ve tried painting in blender with many different add-ons over the years and its never as good. You can also bake your AO really quickly in 3dcoat to use as a lighting guide before turning it off. For realistic looking clothing like the pants I&#039;ve done here, you want to find a base texture for the material it&#039;s made of from an image and create a seamless texture from it to fill the clothing with. Once you&#039;ve done this you create 2 layers above it. A shade layer set to Multiply and a highlight layer set to Screen. Use a base color that matches your material when painting in both, shades being more saturated and hue shifted toward blue and highlights being desaturated and shifted toward yellow/orange generally.<br><br>It really fucking sucks theres pretty much zero tutorials online for painting REALISTIC textures by hand into a single texture. Almost ALL hand painting tutorials are for the World of Warcraft stylized look.",

But then on top of it add about a 2% white/black noise layer Multiplied on top of it at about 20% opacity or so. Then over that apply a Red/Yellow/Blue &quot;Render Clouds&quot; texture over that set to Overlay blend mode to add randomness to the skin color. <br><br>I normally flatten the shade/highlight layers down into the base color at some point then start color picking from that to add more colorful flesh tones to it. Its far from perfect but I&#039;m still experimenting with it. I&#039;m still hunting more tricks and ideas on making the skin look more realistic, other than just getting better at painting in general.",

The pic rel is a 512x512 texture done by using Blenders stencil feature and was edited with Clip Studio Paint. Since your a solo dev this technique would probably be the best as it&#039;s quite quick while still being able to produce that early to mid 2000s style. I go for a more 2000-2005 style but you could definitely make some stuff more akin to model posted in the OP with some trial and error, although you would definitely need some more texture painting. As you said its really difficult to find resources on this era of graphics but I&#039;ve done some digging and here is some stuff I&#039;ve found. <br><br>This channel is from a guy who is versed in the style and has a lot of good resources on his website too. Specifically has a really good character tutorial that&#039;s even using the software that was used during the era, 3D Studio Max and Bodypaint<br>https://www.youtube.com/@videogamem<wbr>aker <br><br>I&#039;ve also found some books on the subject, particularly one from 2006 called &quot;3D Game Textures: Create Professional Game Art Using Photoshop&quot;. It might be hard to find torrents of books like these due to the age and lack of interest but they&#039;re a resource straight from that era. I haven&#039;t started reading them yet because I&#039;m working on a project atm so I can&#039;t say how effective they are but there is certainly some techniques to be gleaned. <br><br>Also study the models and environments from games of that time, I take a ton of screenshots from games like Oblivion, Postal, RTCW, and the like. I&#039;m glad that other people are passionate about this style, so many games are based off of PS1 but this &quot;mid poly&quot; era gets skipped over entirely it seems.",

I&#039;ve struggled for ages when it comes to texture painting since I can&#039;t draw, and relying on photos for texturing has limits, plus procedural stuff like PBR can only get you so far <br>this allows me to quickly sculpt out a form, use Quad Remesher to get the low poly, then bake all the detail right on the low poly <br>you could likely get better results by manually box modeling over for the low poly, but I suck at that so I leave it to automation with QR<br>here&#039;s a post I made on the process <br><a href=\"/3/thread/992953#p1011119\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1011119</a><br><br><a href=\"#p1011131\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1011131</a><br>I sculpt in blender since you can do the entire baking process in there, and it&#039;s free, but yeah this method works. I&#039;m surprised that I&#039;ve never really seen it discussed when it comes to PS1 low poly stuff. not sure how often the method was used for PS2 era visuals <br>only caveat is that you need to learn anatomy, but that&#039;s far easier than actually learning to draw, in my experience",

Either way the tone mapper was very shitty and has lots of clipping (notice how the highlights on Count Dooku&#039;s face and neckpiece are clipping to nuclear white, which is something you never see anymore in modern CG).<br>The 2000s film rendering pipeline is fairly standardized and there should be some internet autists that made guides on how to replicate it in [Modern Program X], everything else is artistic decisions within that tool set.",

I know they also did something where they&#039;d take their unlit previs renders, let their concept artists draw lighting onto a still image of the shot, and then they&#039;d light the shot to match what the artist for every shot so it had a more cinematic lighting style instead of something physically accurate.",

Still a &quot;miss&quot; on the likeness part, maybe even worse than normal because I didn&#039;t outright trace a camera-matched profile view this time (even though there is a pretty good photo for it) and eyeballed the entire thing. But I had fun sculpting his ridiculous body, so I decided to start retopologizing and rigging the guy. Only did the head so far as you can see in one of the pictures, but I&#039;m suddenly not sure if I should proceed with the retopo or if I should try to match his face more correctly, at least by tracing a profile view as I normally do. And maybe fix any anatomy mistakes that you can see, of which there are probably a lot. What do you guys think?",

I mean I know there&#039;s ColorToRGB, but I only ever used it in NPR setting where I simply could output it to ColorRamp and configure the whole palette there. But here I need PBR material with all it&#039;s colors so it&#039;s kinda not gonna work, at least not that easy (I can&#039;t configure gazilion colors in ColorRamp). Sounds like I should try to decompose h/s/v components and mess with value, but that doesn&#039;t sound fun or easy either. Not sure how to recolor it even if I do that.",

They need to sit perfectly equidistant and to get that location you can just make a circle with the center on the &quot;elbow&quot; joint, the edge along the circle is the exact point of the sister bone. Don&#039;t know if this is a correct and legitimate method to do this.",

But I can sort of lay curves along a surface, and make them spiral around a normal. And raise and lower the tips. So I shaped them into this short hair cut, with a bit of waviness to the strips.<br><br>After converting the curves into mesh strips, I then figured out how to apply a cylinder SDF to those strips, and set up the bump properly. Doing a bunch of math to make sure the cylinder remains proportional to the dimensions of each strip. Even when the strips are at random sizes.<br>Then the cylinder is repeated to fill out the strips, again, keeping perfect proportion. I&#039;m very proud of this. It took a great deal of effort.<br><br>Then I figured out how to use the white noise node to create different values per strand inside of each strip. Using that to create variation in cylinder length, color, and bump intensity.<br>The length variation really helped to make the hair look less like uniform stripes, and more like actual hairs.<br>Then I use the white noise node trick again to mask larger chunks. Multiplying them with the individual strands, thus creating sort of &quot;clumps&quot; of hair. So it&#039;s not all randomly sized. It&#039;s a clumped random.<br><br>There&#039;s still more work to do. I want to figure out how to make the cylinders curl and wave, while maintaining proportion inside of the mesh strips. That&#039;s going to be the next big hurdle.<br>Also, right now, the hair consists of 96,000 triangles, because I&#039;ve spread 2000 curves evenly across he skull. I will be able to reduce the number of curves by more strategically laying the hair to cover more surface area. I just haven&#039;t gotten around to doing that yet.",

The edges you see selected in picrel are the limit between one vertex group and the next, with on loop cut on each side to facilitate deformations. Is this a decent approach?

I need the loops to turn, so I create a 5 that allows turning. Simple necessity dictates its existence.<br>5 way poles are not going to cause harm to shading. The disadvantage with 5s, is that 1 vert dictates the volume of that area. So a 5 area might appear flatter in locations that required fullness.The trick is to place them into relatively flat areas, where the edges will be mostly spread out evenly. Or inside of creases where the edges will get tucked.<br>So in the image, the 5s are placed along the crease lines. Where I expect the groin area to crease in the front, and where the butt is expected to crease in the back. Perhaps I could have made the back crease lower. But, eh.<br><br>From my testing, 3s are the ones that fuck up shading. You don&#039;t want 3s on convex surfaces at all. That&#039;s mainly what my topology avoids. A lot of tutorials place 3s on the butt area, because they want that fullness when the leg bends. But if you set up the butt just so, then you can get the fullness without 3s fucking up the shading. Here, the 3s are on the &quot;inside&quot;, the concave part of the ass, along the inner crack. They will be hidden away there.<br><br>You can&#039;t get around using 3s or 5s. It&#039;s actually impossible. You have to turn loops to make smooth topology. When you turn a loop, you create a 5. And when you create a 5, it has to be resolved by a 3 somewhere. Don&#039;t ask me how it works, it&#039;s just the laws of math and topology. Best not to worry about them too much. Except try to keep 3s away from convex surfaces if you can.(Unless you just need a corner.)<br><br>Hard surfaces can handle 5s too. But I&#039;m less experienced with hard surface modelling, so I don&#039;t feel like I can speak with authority there. Only that if you look around, you will see 5s in the work of professionals. Because it&#039;s unavoidable.",

I was hesitant to post it today, because I like the way the other anon&#039;s ass uses edge sharping for the crease between cheek and thigh. It&#039;s so clean.<br>Though I&#039;m not sure how good that edge sharp will look come time to move the thigh. Since you would want it to smooth out as the thigh and glute stretch out. But maybe there is a way to control the crease through nodes. Perhaps capture the normals along the sharpened edge on the face corner domain. Since the face corners will be on opposite sides of the edge. It will be as if you captured split normals. And then capture an interpolated version of the normals. And then plug the split normals and interpolated normals into a mix vector node. The mix vector node is a lerping function. You can lerp between the two vectors by plugging percentage values into the factor. So you would want to get the difference between the resting area of the faces, and the posed area of the faces. Scale that difference, and plug it into the factor of the mix value node.<br>If everything works how I&#039;m imagining it, then the normal will transition from creased to smooth as the mesh stretches out.",

A better question might be why something like the Unity/Godot/Unreal editors don&#039;t have a Forge-style mode for level editing. It especially makes sense for Unity and Unreal where there is a HUGE market of premade models and prefabs. I think there&#039;s a argument for it there.",

I googled and lurked here for a while and came up with this workflow to create assets. I&#039;d appreciate any feedback from anons with experience so I don&#039;t blindly waste my time learning suboptimal tools.<br><br>My use case will be creating and animating assets for my game. I will use Vroid for humanoids, model and sculpt environment assets, and sculpt monsters. Animations would be basic game animations and some cutscenes (short and not too complex). The style will be stylized pbr (similar to genshin, wuva). <br><br>With regards to sculpting, would I be able to do everything with blender. I have hard surface modelling experience, but never sculpted before. I&#039;m following Modeng&#039;s Artstation course, where he uses Zbrush to finalise environment assets made in Blender. I&#039;m also sculpting monsters and other creatures I can&#039;t make in vroid. I would like to know whether this can be done in Blender or if ZBrush would be better.<br><br>I know some anons say that Maya/ 3ds is easier for animating, but since I&#039;m making short animations (movement, attacks, idle, interactions), can I get away with it? I hate autodesk and would prefer not to give them money. I don&#039;t plan to work in this field, so I don&#039;t have to follow an industry standard, just a good workflow to make my games.<br><br>Thanks.",

That has partly to do with the fact that the breasts seem to have more weight to them, with the way they overlap the torso and create a sharp crease underneath.<br><br><a href=\"#p1012182\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1012182</a><br>I want to say the problem with the breasts has to do with an incomplete understanding of anatomy. The shoulder-armpit area is what gives it away to me. Ultimately, that limited knowledge of the anatomy affects the breasts as well, but in a smaller way. Breasts come in many strange shapes and sizes, but those ones look rather moundlike and don&#039;t droop very much at all, unlike in your second post.<br>The other part of that is the topology like you guessed. In my experience with working with that general poly count, I usually find that it helps to have another mesh with altered topology to use for the normals. you can give your main mesh a data transfer modifier with the other mesh as the source, edge data checked, sharp selected, and mapping set to whatever works the best. It also helps a lot to set the models to shade auto smooth (180 degrees) so it acts like a regular shade smooth, but you can also mark edges as sharp.",

Once you run a script, it modifies the geometry, and it needs to be run manually. So if you want to make changes on the script driven operation, you need to keep a copy of the unmodified object and re-run the script with different inputs every time. Geonodes being modifiers means that they aren&#039;t destructive and also that they&#039;re animatable. Other advantages of modifiers are that you can easily preview your changes live by directly modifying the inputs, that they play nice with other modifiers, that they&#039;re easily reusable and copy-able between objects or projects in bulk and that they&#039;re safe to readily use from other people&#039;s files without having to check the logic for aids.<br>Geonodes have hard limitations, but for things within their capabilities they are vastly superior to scripting.",

I personally don&#039;t trust AI and don&#039;t use it, but programmers I know do, and it helps them get things done. However, these guys are already Sr level (or nearly Sr) so they are pretty good at evaluating AI output. Regarding your expectations for AI, it couldn&#039;t code at all a few years ago and the current pace of improvement is staggering. The fact that so many programmers use it effectively today is nothing short of incredible. even if just used as an elaborate autocomplete that you&#039;re forced to edit saves a shitload of time.",

Programming, on the other hand, is inherently self-deprecating cycle of learning, using and then forgetting, infinite numbers of application programming interfaces that pop into and out of existence all the time. There are some super basic fundamentals that are common, and the ceiling to them is very low, after that it&#039;s basically all googling new shit, using it, and forgetting about it. Even worse, code has no inherent self-worth. I mean, it bears no value (outside of corporate human resource management concerns, ie &quot;best practices&quot; and &quot;code conventions&quot;) how it looks, the only value of code is the result of its execution.

That shape would be better using subdivision surface modeling, which requires fewer verticies/faces. I would start again with a cylinder llike you did, give it a triangle fan fill on the caps (in the popup dialog box), use maybe 16 verts, then add a sub-d modifier. From there it&#039;s a matter of adding edge loops and tweaking verts to get the shape right. This isn&#039;t an easy &quot;beginner&quot; shape so don&#039;t feel too frustrated. The key to good sub-d modeling is edge flow and properly positioning poles. Keeping everything quads is great, but don&#039;t stress about quads if it looks fine with triangles and n-gons (though harder to cheat under a sub-d modifier).",

Furthermore,the meaning of &quot;good topology&quot; will change depending on the purpose of the model. <br><br>In the example you provided I would say though the toplogy is quite poor. Ideally you want each 4 sided face to be a square or somewhat close to one. Here you can see in the legs especially, there are way, way too many vertical edges. This is bad because it will give the mesh a very ugly shape and not deform well in animation. It&#039;s also just unecessary addition of vertices. The &quot;knee ring&quot; is to assist in deformation when the leg is bent. Although it is pointless as the model is of such poor and low quality. What the legs really need is a reduction of around 3 vertical edges in the quad area, then instead of the knee ring just have 2 poles at the base of each side of the knee to reduce the vertical edges further as it moves down to the calves which are much smaller.<br><br>TLDR: Topology should be purpose-driven. Every face/pole for a reason. Then, square or close to square faces. Smooth edge flow, no jagged crap.",

I don&#039;t know what to call it, &#039;flat&#039; maybe?<br>The plane will look fine until I try to do anything with the shape like add loop cuts or try to shrinkwrap something into it. When I do, I can tell its fucked because the loop cuts add weird creases, and the shrinkwraps don&#039;t completely z-fight like they would a normal flat plane. How can I avoid/fix this?<br>I know I can do looptools&gt;flatten will turn it into a proper flat plane, but I don&#039;t really get to control the direction, and it pretty much ruins the shape I&#039;m going for. I guess learning to prevent it is more valuable, but I&#039;m open to both prevention and solutions.",

In your case, if you want to flatten a plane that&#039;s been rotated an arbitrary amount, first select all the faces you want to flatten, then change the Transform Orientation to &quot;Normal&quot; (your gimbal should change direction). Then, press S (scale), Z (the direction of the normals), then 0 (zero on the keyboard). This will flatten all the selected faces/verticies. Depending on how deformed your faces are you might need to nudge them back into place.",

My goal was to have 8 joints around the perimeter. The bing pose for the joints on the body mesh had them completely closed. Then I opened them till the masjora and minora lined up, and bound them to the labia so that when I put them back at the resting position everything would stay lined up, and it would look good and right when spread open. <br>Disaster. The mesh got crazy and spiky whenever it was closed or in any position less than the bind pose. I never fixed it. It&#039;s my belief now that the bulk of the deformation needs to be driven by shape keys, and that joints are just for very broad movement.",

You can easily sculpt a tight butthole that looks great, or a gaping open one that also looks great. But when you deform either mesh to become the other it&#039;s very difficult. What once was big is small or vice versa. Stretching textures, now verts driven by joint A are too far away and dont look right and need to be driven by joint B.<br>The play is toi pick your battles. The hardest version of this problem is a fully modeled interior that must be animated and seen from very close up so it must have high res textures and impeccable normals. The easiest is like a little pocket of verts with a picture of a gaping something, and when you need to you unfold that pocket, and very quickly shove something in it, and only view it from relatively far away.<br>The second strategy accounts for 80% of the use cases anyways.",

If you can&#039;t figure it out from that information alone then 3d is not for you. If you&#039;re trying to hit a detail benchmark you can use google, or common sense. Do you struggle to have numerous copies of your own asset in the viewport of a 3d software? probably good for prenders.

The first thing that comes to my mind is to keep arcs and rings separate and simply boolean subtract inner space of rings to get rid of arc segments inside of rings. This approach is clunky, inaccurate and I think it looks and shades problematically in places where rings connect to arc. But I&#039;m not sure of better ways. Maybe do it in lowpoly and try to manually connect arc mesh and ring meshes by heavily messing with geometry by hand? Sounds doable, but quite inaccurate and complex. How would you do it?",

A digital 3D product is subordinate to a painting by an old master because the painting requires both a mental model of nature (representation skill) and careful consideration of its depiction to make it beautiful. To use your argument about how easy sculpting is: To plot figures in space you import models and put them in the scene, you can move them as you please and iterate freely. To do so for a painting requires careful consideration and knowledge of perspective, composition, form, etc. and moving a figure requires a mental reprojection of the subject and how it affects and is affected by the environment.",

Although it kinda is a difference of perspective due to peoduction scale. In 3d you can change different parts (shape, materials, animation) without affecting others, its very modular so revisions are easy, but there&#039;s more work up front. Like, if a character for which you have a minute of animation needs different clothes, in 2d everything has to be redrawn, while in 3d you mostly just rework the mesh.<br><br>Anyway, you make it pretty clear in your terms that refunds are only for a no-show, if work is delivered and you can prove it they can go fuck themselves. Also they pay at least part of it up front. Then to minimize the risk they won&#039;t like it ypu involve them at all stages because earlier changes are easier and if they fail to give feedback until after delivery then they can also go eat dicks and/of have to pay extra.",

Like I&#039;m never going to be able to make something like pic related. I can&#039;t imagine myself being able to make something this good ever. I feel like I&#039;m only good enough for retail work and anything too complex is outside my mental capacity. I don&#039;t know what the minimum IQ is for this work is but it&#039;s clearly way above me. It just looks so intimidating. I couldn&#039;t hack it with STEM which is why I went with a political science degree instead. I&#039;m 27 now and I&#039;m too old to learn. I still struggle with the UI of programs.",

To say that booleans aren&#039;t useful is like saying that professional authors don\u2019t use the letter &quot;n&quot; in their books\u2014it&#039;s just a basic tool in a 3D modeler\u2019s arsenal.<br>Booleans are still valuable for certain types of modeling, especially in architectural design. For example, a wall with a window opening doesn&#039;t require edge loops or a consistent poly count. However, placing windows on a high-rise using a boolean operation is inefficient; a parametric or modular approach is better. Spline-based booleans are excellent for creating urban grids and similar structures.<br>In hard surface modeling, booleans can be used to quickly establish a preliminary volume before retopologizing. Furthermore, CAD or NURBS-based programs rely heavily on booleans, as they are designed to define geometry using numerical data rather than just polygons. Answer cleaned using ai cuz im lazy.",

Much less from the profile view as it&#039;s the most unreliable in drawings. If I had to bandaid your model I&#039;d start from giving her more of a cheek, reduce her jawline and make the head taper more toward the bottom (switch to &quot;active element&quot; for the pivot, select the tip of the nose and shear laterally a bit from the front view).<br>When trying to match drawn reference, it&#039;s best to eyeball it rather than trace it. The primary reason is that drawings are simply inaccurate enough for that, and the secondary one is that you can&#039;t really read shapes well on toon shaded drawings in the sense that you can see the outline, but that&#039;s really all, which isn&#039;t much information. When eyeballing give preference to 3/4 and front views in that order. Note landmarks that you can&#039;t compromise on and stubbornly keep them. For example, you simply can not have the outer edge of the eye be the edge of the model in a 3/4 view - there always needs to be a patch of skin in-between. The red lines on the attached pic are very important.<br>Here&#039;s my quick take on your reference, obj format for if you&#039;re paranoid: https://files.catbox.moe/bp1fxy.obj<wbr>",

I really appreciate all the insight and info, as they\u2019re rare to come by, i do still wonder if this is possible in live preview software&#039;s like ue5 and unity, my project is gameplayish (Mix Of Software And Game)<br><br>Here More details about me and my project if anyone interested and would like to give me tips or criticism :<br><br>i come from 2D animation background, worked as an intern in Japanese animation industry. and on some vtuber lore videos<br>and now I&#039;m looking into 3d animations because of the versatility and ways to have said animations be interactive, there is where i stumbled upon game engines<br><br>I still wanted to use my 2D animation skills so i was inspired by that artist and how the mouth and facial expression move like a 2d animation would, alongside the lighting and shading ofc,<br>my project isn&#039;t really a full fledged game but more so an interactive system that serve niche issue im seeing on the internet, I&#039;m working on the render and technical parts first before dive deep into the core of the project<br><br>I&#039;m currently juggling between UE5 and Unity to compare their differences, as they seem to fit my needs, AE for compositing and Blender is always in the mix too, since it can do so much and act as a converter for non FBX formats<br><br>i do have a question regarding game engines,<br><br>unreal engine 5 advertise itself as THE shader maker, but one of its biggest game (fortnite) doesn&#039;t have that much of stylized shader/material let alone high quality anime one<br><br>while unity is lightweight and has been used for really well made anime style 3d (my fav in term of aesthetic is ZZZ, expressive stretchy animations), its workflow doesn&#039;t flow well with my other software and its animation tools really lacking compare to blender and ue5<br><br>i guess its not about the tools but more so the skills.",

I tried and experiment where I projected elsa&#039;s face and did some touchup work on it. I&#039;m using a layered shader for 2D eyes.<br>Obviously. It&#039;s a humungous improvement, because I projected a professional render onto my 3d model. What I want to capture is, what parts of this texture are selling the face the best so I can make my own texture that does the same thing just as well.",

I know about this concept where you paint bright yellow, blue, and red in different locations on an &quot;overlay&quot; channel and thats for different spots on the body that touch bone or have a lot of blood vessels. It never looks right. Elsa doesnt seem to have any yellow. just blush that wraps all to the side of her head, top of the nose, and its dark and blue around her eyes.",

If you are young 20 something the world is your oyster. Once you enter 30 life passes you by quick so you are more selective about your interests. Bring in health issues to the table then it becomes your #1 priority. Anyway, all I can say is you should have a clear goal in mind for 3d art or you&#039;ll end up right back to where you started.",

OK Here&#039;s what you do, as a drawer turned 3d modeller.<br>You&#039;re going to draw image planes of w/e you&#039;re drawing, a character I assume. Front and side, orthographic, in what&#039;s called a T-pose if you&#039;re scared, and an A-pose if you&#039;re hard(google them). These front and side images(at least. more is better) need to line up their features and have 1-1 proportions. I like to put them on the same image, but you can certainly voodoo up separate images which are all pixel aligned. After that google &quot;face topology&quot; you&#039;ll get pictures of 3d faces with circles and groups of color on them. Pick one and draw on a copy of your image planes that topology. Keep it 1-1 accurate. If your character happens to be a very beautiful young female, there&#039;s going to be this giant void of detail around her cheek. It&#039;s a tricky area, I&#039;m taking your word that you can draw. It should be easy to do for you.<br>Now into our 3d program. you need to find out how the fuck to set up image planes. &quot;set up image planes&quot;. I dont use blender. I assume it&#039;s very easy. You set these up in the 3d stage so they line up and you see the front in the front view etc. From the front view, or whichever view makes sense, front for human flat faces, side for long animal faces. You are now going to draw a big polygon flat on the front view. When you&#039;re drawing a polygon it&#039;s exactly like the polygon tool in photoshop. You click to add vertices, and the last vert always connects to your first vert, so you wanna draw around and meet back up with that first vert. You can draw pieces and connect them. You can draw one big one and slice it up. Blender can do that I&#039;m sure. Now for how closely you match your drawing in terms of how many vertices. The more you do the harder the next part will be, and there is no advantage to doing &quot;extra&quot; at this stage. It is good to add more verts in tight corners, and important details.<br>cont",

I think, at least, a texture based highlights on their own layer, so they dont move around with the iris, is optimal. You might want some uguu crazy nonsense highlights. I have a flat texture shader for some eyes. The high lights are real specular highlights, and I used a spherical normal map on the eye portion of the texture to sharpen the high light up. It works OK, but the spot will disappear in the many lighting conditions where it logically wouldnt, and I lose the Anime(tm) look. I might switch to textured highlights.",

In stylized PBR as I see it, maybe some classic photo textures can be used, but with heavy processing. For example, I suspect on that OP screenshot stone floor might be a normal stone texture processed to the level that it&#039;s mostly flat and monotonous but if you look carefully you see how much there is going on still.",

But PBR is a rendering method that enables using a bunch of maps.<br>If you don&#039;t use those maps you don&#039;t need PBR. Thus I don&#039;t understand what you mean there.<br>It doesn&#039;t matter how your normal or roughness map are produced, if you use them at all it&#039;s a PBR renderer at play, otherwise you can&#039;t even use them.<br>In terms of Blender PBR is basically using Principal BSDF anywhere. If your scene has at least one material that uses Principal BSDF it means you&#039;re using PBR.<br>If your style is not photorealism but requires using Principal BSDF node (or equivalent in other 3d software or game engine), it&#039;s a stylized PBR style.",

Maybe it doesn&#039;t work equally well for everything, but it sure works nice for stuff like wood, metals, stones, etc. You can just overpaint the same area with different portions of wood texture with like alpha 0.1-0.3 and it will look like a completely different texture. Not sure what to do with PBR stuff though, if there is a way for roughness/normal to automatically follow whatever you do with base color using stencils, it would work amazingly well.",

What I really want from computer graphics is hyperreal, surreal, otherworldly, mind-blowing, phenomenal, breathtaking, stupendous, unbelievable, spectacular, astonishing, unparalleled, incomparable, beyond compare, singular, rare, alien-like, cosmic, extraterrestrial, surreal, space-age, heavenly, divine, delectable, mouthwatering. But, when you look at it in a more technical way, you can do whatever fantasy you want with PBR rendering techniques, you just have to learn the ways to create PBR textures of something that doesn&#039;t exists. And this is quite a problem sometimes actually. While I can generate decent PBR masonry with all kinds of maps in Material Maker and such, with photorealistic foliage of non-existant plants I&#039;m quite lost. I guess the best bet here is to micromodel it in 3d and render sprites from there, and use those as billboards afterwise.",

Realism can be useful for depicting stories that you feel requires a distinct focus on immersion or groundedness.

Which front-loads the process with a lot of problem solving. Whereas sculpting makes the beginning process smoother, since you can turn your brain off, and just mush the geometry around.<br>However, as the box modeller comes to solve the geometry, the BACK half of the process is a lot easier, because they only need to sculpt their clean topology. And if they need more detail, they just Subdivide.<br><br>So it is more or less the same time commitment. Personally, I find box modelling to be better, since I prefer to get the hard part done first. And I also just enjoy solving topology like a puzzle. I don&#039;t like work where the tedious part is at the end. So retopology is really annoying to me. It reminds me of my 2D work.

Everyone in the comments section was glazing him and when I pointed out it was AI he deleted my comments kek. Normies are too dumb or dont care enough about artistic integrity and soulful art.

These operations are wasteful if the ray hits an area that is completely transparent but the process can&#039;t be skipped because that part may be semi-transparent and Redshift cannot assume otherwise. Because of this, the transparency trace depth has to be increased in order to prevent rays from being terminated prematurely which introduces visual artifacts. The Sprite node, on the other hand, is optimized to skip fully transparent parts of a polygon and with very few operations.</span><br><br>https://help.maxon.net/r3d/maya/en-<wbr>us/Content/html/Sprite+Node.html<br><br>i also peeped that your webm says something about nanite. i don&#039;t do game stuff so not sure what that&#039;s about.",

It&#039;s a perf hit although for different reasons than the ones involved in ray tracing. This is because rasterizers can use a series of optimizations grouped under the appellation of early-Z. basically checks you can do before running the pixel shader.<br><br>For example, if you render a triangle with no alpha test, you can write depth as soon as you&#039;ve run the vertex shader, so the next triangle can be depth tested against depth in parallel with the pixel shader for the current triangle being run. But if you need alpha test, then the pixle shader must be run before the next triangle can be tested.<br><br>That&#039;s not the only one, another common one is dividing the screen into tiles, and as long as a tile is entirely covered by a triangle instead of writing each pixel you just write the plane parameters (4 numbers) for the whole tile and do further depth tests against that, saving tons of bandwidth (for an 8x8 tile it&#039;d be 16 times less bandwidth for example).<br><br>As a consequence games usually render all the alpha tested stuff after all the opaque stuff to speed things up. Another optimization is to render only depth at first, so you can run a pxiel shader that only does the strict minimum for an alpha test, then a second pass of the whole scene where you don&#039;t write depth but instead test for equality, so you only have to run the part of the shader that writes color and part of the early Z stuff can run in parallel because the depth buffer&#039;s static. Like, yeah, if you pixel shader&#039;s complex enough, rendering the whole scene twice to take better advantage of early Z is faster (don&#039;t mistake it for deferred rendering, this is a different trick that can be used with or without it).<br><br>So basically it isn&#039;t cheap at all and a bunch of tricks are used to reduce its impact.",

Due to how a GPU computes derivatives, basically the triangle is drawn as a bunch of 2x2 tiles completely covering the triangle, pixel shader included and the extra pixels are clipped at the end.<br><br>So a triangle that only covers a 1-pixel line in the end would cost twice as much as it should, a 3 pixels triangle would cost 4 pixels, and rendering an extremely subdivided mesh with only 1-pixel triangles for that perfect look would cost 4 times the pixel count (discounting overdraw which would make it worse). So alpha testing becomes much cheaper in comparison.<br><br>In UE5 they deal with that by detecting small triangles and drawing them with a compute shader instead of the traditional pipeline, to avoid the 2x2 thing.",
