There&#039;s nothing refreshing about it. Nothing enjoyable or aesthetically pleasing. If I had to guess, this Christine Nagel boomer never walked in nature a day of her life. Maybe she inhaled nature&#039;s scents but she never smelled them. She just doesn&#039;t have that nose. This is what happens when a normie boomer chemist with clearly no artistic tendencies/sensibilities, only credentials, is allowed to make fragrances. Hermes is selling literal dill-water with this one. Projection and longevity are virtually non-existent here. Encre Noir has better P&amp;L.<br><br>About the cap... it smells best when concentrated. When I spray it I spray point-blank for that reason but unfortunately it&#039;s still not enough to save the perfume. I can only hope it grows on me, that I wake up one day and like it more than usually like with some other frags. I wish whatever pear or grass there is in it opened up more for me but all I&#039;m getting is dill-water.",

The question remains, is it a psychological adjustment/acclimation to the scent or is it subtle changes in the chemistry of the juice?",

Like he took Follow from an EdP straight to an Extrait, and bumped several oils that in large(r) doses smell bad/burnt. Same way animalics are only good (to most people) in small doses, but up the concentration and they literally smell like feces.",

Extra storage and labor add to the cost, not to mention the loss of short term profit. These might seem like small amounts but they translate into huge differences in retail prices. The companies that macerate their perfumes have to charge more but that doesn&#039;t that all the expensive perfumes are macerated. I highly doubt something that sells for less than $50 was macerated.",

To compensate for this slowed growth the oligopoly of Givaudan, Firmenich, and Symrise, have colluded to promote gourmands and sweet scents to increase their profit margins for the aromachemicals that have lower demand due to healthier eating trends. Not only have female scents become sweeter but so have male scents to capitalize on the whole market. Not only does this bring in more profit in fragrances due to higher profit margins it slows the decline in the flavor segment by keeping people craving unhealthy sweet foods. <br><br>Friendly reminder that the top perfumers are not independent rockstars that get to do whatever they want, but employees and shills for the big flavors and fragrances companies: Alberto Morillas (Firmenich), Oliver Cresp (Firmenich), Dominique Ropion (Givaudan), Bertrand Duchaufour (Symrise), Nathalie Larson (Firmenich), Jean-Claude Ellena (Givaudan), Daniela Andrier (Givaudan), Jacques Cavallier-Belletrud (Firmenich), Quentin Bish (Givaudan), Thierry Wasser (Firmenich, Givaudan), Annick Menardo (Firmenich), etc.., Not to mention that youtubers and tiktokers are the biggest shills for sweet scents.<br><br>Wait until you hear why they &quot;banned&quot; oakmoss. Spoiler alert, the answer is also profit margins, because that is always the answer.<br><br>tldr: men have to smell like the candy isle now because the penny-pinchers have to balance for the slowing sales in junk food aroma-chemicals",

Regarding price, it depends on if we can reuse a previously made formula or if it has to be created from scratch. It also depends on who makes it. Generally speaking formulas made by famous perfumers can range from six to seven figures, while those made by unknowns usually go for less. The most important thing is time, if you have a team of lab assistants and technicians working under a master perfumer for a few months it\u2019s gonna cost you a very pretty penny. If it\u2019s just two or three perfumers working on an already previously created formula, it\u2019s still going to cost (around five figures) but you get something very nice out of it.",

I created some formulass where I incorporated it into a fruity leather accord since the hyperessence enhances the floral fruity aspects. Realistically speaking you won\u2019t find any \u201creal\u201d animalic products in commercial fine fragrances unless they are in the high end price bracket, a notable exception is beeswax absolute. Nowadays almost all products containing animalic notes are using premade bases such as Givaudans castoreum givco or castoreum firbest by Firmenich.<br><a href=\"#p18492694\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18492694</a><br>I wouldn\u2019t define MA as a narcotic material. Narcotic notes are usually intense balsamic white florals, best exemplified by Ylang complete or Ylang 1. Most identifiers aren\u2019t necessarily tied to a single product but are rather common and generally used by all perfumers to define certain materials. In the end each perfumer has a certain way of identifying materials and associated a particular idea with them. My schooling was quite traditional in that sense, but nowadays most perfumers keep their own \u201cbooks\u201d about materials full of annotations, sort of like Arcadi Boix Camps. I haven\u2019t been working here for that long but I\u2019ve been involved in creating a couple of very successful fragrances, all of which I unfortunately cannot discuss, not even what materials were used. I have both worked as an assistant to some well known professionals and worked as part of a team or solo for some smaller projects. I can\u2019t reveal what, but I worked on a fragrance that was very well received at Esxence",

Can be taken orally or topically.<br>5ARIs are not dosage dependent, taking as little as as 0.2mg daily fin can reduce serum DHT by 68%, while 5mg reduces by 72%.<br>0.5mg daily dut reduces serum DHT by 95%, but is considered a second line treatment, and can be more expensive and harder to get prescribed. Start with fin.<br><br>Fin has been used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for 30+ years, it&#039;s very well studied and is tolerated well in almost all men, however, there&#039;s a 1-2% risk of erectile issues in controlled studies.<br>These can be avoided by reducing dosage, spacing out dosage, or stopping the drug. Fin takes days to fully bio-accumulate, the half life of fin is about 8 hours, adverse effects occuring within minutes of starting fin or persisting long after stopping fin are not real and have no basis in reality. Please note that dut has a much higher half-life of 5 weeks, if you&#039;re prone to fin sides, dut may cause them for far longer.<br>Refer to https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/ar<wbr>ticles/PMC3481923/ before responding to PFS trolls.<br><br>(continued on next post)",

Min is taken with fin to restore your hair to it&#039;s original hairline, thickness and vigor when hair loss is caught early enough, (pre-NW2). Can be taken orally or topically.<br><br>Topical min does not work in 1/3 of men because they lack the required enzymes in their scalp, all men have this enzyme in their liver so the oral route is a good fallback.<br>The FDA formulation for 5% liquid minoxidil is food safe (vape juice, ethanol and water) and can be safely taken orally if oral min tabs are expensive or rarely prescribed where you live. As a general rule, ~4 drops (0.1ml) = 5mg minoxidil.<br>There&#039;s a 1-2% risk of fluid retention with higher oral dosages, start with the lowest dosage possible and work your way up when you&#039;re sure it&#039;s well tolerated.<br><br>Ketoconazole is an anti-androgen and antifungal that inhibits DHT on the scalp and used to treat fungal infections of the scalp that may be making your hair loss worse such as seborrheic dermatitis, a condition where you exhibit severe greasy, flaky large dandruff flakes with dried yellow crystals (blood plasma) embedded in the scalp. Some people may only have traction alopecia (hair loss from scratching or friction), but it will not cure androgenic alopecia on it&#039;s own. Can only be taken topically.<br><br>Do not use spirolactone. Spirolactone is a diuretic which, in large doses, inhibits testosterone and, by extension, DHT.<br>It is regularly prescribed as an anti-androgen for male to female HRT, and thus, comes with an astronomically higher risk of sexual side effects in men including ED, gynecomastia, and can cause potassium toxicity.<br><br>Previous thread: <a href=\"/fa/thread/18480968#p18480968\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18480968</a>",

Find the average price in your contry and avoid choosing someone charging below avg. <br>Also no doctor is God and the final result depends on your case, how your body responds and so on.

His color coordination is decent, the natural distressing looks great, and the sashiko fabric is really beautiful if you isolate it from the current wearer.",

Out of all of them, I think whitesville is the best. Yes, the Real Mccoys 2 pack is super nice, but they actually are like 1.5-2 inches too long after washing, so you&#039;ll need to get them hemmed. Whitesville tees have the best, most universal cut with very comfy fabric, and the relative value is pretty much unbeatable for something jap made. If you want something slightly more heavy feeling with a tiny bit more texture, Real Mccoys 2 pack is great.",

All their denims are gimmicky and their cuts don\u2019t look as great as any standard vintage 501 repro. Go with the Fullcount 0105 or 1101 in their 13.7 oz denim and thank me later. It\u2019s extremely soft, breathable denim, and their cuts are actually based on vintage 501s which are going to offer more leg room and mobility. If you go with the 0105, it\u2019s considerably wider and the denim has some elasticity to it so I would suggest going with your standard US vanity sizing instead of the recommended +1 size for most jap brands. If you don\u2019t like the Fullcounts, go with TCB 50s (pic related) and call it a day",

The higher rise and slightly larger thighs allows for more mobility and comfort on my part. I like the 634 for what it is, but I have no clue why Iron Heart was so insistent on making the rise LOW. They could easily add another 0.5 inches to the rise and be well within the ball park of an actual 60s repro cut. Beside that, they have some weird insistence on adding weird, completely unnecessary modifications to their cuts. For example, the absurd magnitude of taper on the 1955 below the knee was completely unnecessary. The cut is essentially a legit 1955 cut, but they were like, &quot;lets appeal to all the aging millennials and gen x crowd by making this a &#039;tapered&#039; cut&quot;. It would look a million times better if they reduced the taper a significant amount. <br><br><a href=\"#p18490379\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18490379</a><br>Currently rocking their 0105 in the 13.7 oz this summer.

If you size up on the 1101 to a thigh width that is slightly larger and then just wear a belt, it ends up being better. You get some relaxation or slouch, but it\u2019s not anywhere near the enormity of the 0105\u2019s top block. I wear a 33 in most American brands, a 33 in the 0105, and a 35 in the 1101 for my desired thigh width. I can post a fit pic of the 1101 later if you\u2019re interested. <br><br><a href=\"#p18490916\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18490916</a><br>If you absolutely love the fit of the TCB 50s, the Real Mccoys Lot 001xx is almost the same exact same cut. It\u2019s been in my main rotation the last few months and it\u2019s realistically the best cut I\u2019ve ever worn. The most technically correct fitting top block ever made with a perfect leg width. I measured the dimensions of them and realized they\u2019re basically the same as the size chart Redcast Heritage provides for the TCB 50s. The problem is that Real Mccoys just restocked them this year and increased the price like $110. I bought them last year for $380 which is already really expensive for a pair of repros. All that said, they are allowed to price in such a crazy tier because they are essentially the closest thing you can get to an actual pair of 501s from the 50s. Beside those, I highly recommend Freewheeler\u2019s 1947. SOLID quality control and my second favorite cut ever. The stitching work is the cleanest I\u2019ve ever seen",

I could do a size 34 for a better fitting waist, but the 1101\u2019s top block is pretty slim for a 1947 inspired cut, so i preferred sizing up for extra leg width to accommodate my slightly larger thighs. Compared to my 0105s in size 33, I prefer how these look. However, there is a slight restriction of mobility in the crotch area. In order for me to elevate my legs without tension in the crotch, I need to pull up the legs of the jeans or pull the waist up to my hips, which is counter to how jeans will naturally rest slouch below my hips. It\u2019s not a crazy amount of restriction, but it\u2019s noticeably more than the 0105. Even though I prefer how the 1101 looks relative to the 0105, 90% I will reach for the 0105s because of how incredibly comfortable and functional they are. Pure unrestricted mobility. This may not be a big dealbreaker for you, but I personally place a huge factor of importance on how mobile a pair of jeans are in the crotch area. If I can\u2019t easily elevate my legs, it drives me nuts. <br><br>Fullcount\u2019s philosophy is comfort. The 0105 is based on a pair of 1953 repros, but they intentionally made the cut more wide to provide maximum comfort and mobility This isn\u2019t to say the 1101 isn\u2019t comfortable, you just need to know that it won\u2019t be nearly as comfortable as the 0105, especially if you have athletic thighs like myself. If you\u2019re a slim dude, you should have zero issue with the 1101. I think the ultimate reason to buy a pair of Fullcounts is for comfort. The relatively loose weave denim with Zimbabwean cotton paired with a wide cut is what does that. This is why I reach for my 0105s way more than my 1101, because they are fundamental recipe of Fullcount\u2019s philosophy. I never even really liked how the cut looked, but because they feel incredible, I look past their appearance and instead just enjoy wearing the jeans themselves.",

Because the RGT jacket looks slim, you\u2019ll need to size up which will increase the length of the jacket. Generally, jackets like that look better when their length is more balanced. Not saying you should be going for a full blown cropped cut, but it will look slightly off if the bottom of the jacket hangs below your crotch or ass",

You don&#039;t need to go full blown coal miner railroad conductor depression era autism mode, but start browsing the catalogs of companies like Real McCoys, Buzz Rickson, Warehouse, and Freewheelers. You can grab vintage pieces from these companies to put together a casual outfit with some elements of modern streetwear fashion. A lot of times I&#039;ll search specific pairs of repro jeans on instagram and then browse all the worldwide posts of dudes wearing those jeans or some other piece of interest within the context of a full outfit. A lot of them are very autismo larp, but some of them are fairly well put together and casual/natural looking, especially those from actual Japanese instagram users. Leaning more into a repro-inspired style will be more classic and timeless, which is a pretty safe bet if you&#039;re already in your 30s. The issue with companies like Freenote or especially RGT is that they are stuck in the relatively short-lived 2010 millennial era where all their jeans are either pretty slim relative to an actual vintage 501 cut, or they have an absurd amount of taper which makes you look homosexual. Things like heavy weight denim, tapered cuts, slim cuts are extremely millennial coded. Yes, you are a millennial, but the fashion that millennials were known for arguably looks awful especially compared to the classic american pieces of clothing that were tied to counterculture and rebellion in the 40s-60s.",

Think Springsteen in his prime or Swayze in Roadhouse. Its just a massive pain in the ass to find a pair that fits that way so I end up settling.<br>And the Wescos are great. I very quickly went from one pair to four (black cxl mr lou- pictured, black waxed olive mr lou, black cxl boss, burlap boss 7500) with a fifth on the way (umber cxl). I find them comfortable, but Ive also been wearing leather footwear the majority of my adult life with just one painful break in across dozens of pairs so I may not be the best person to gauge comfort off of.",

In /fa/ one&#039;s identity is alot more prevalant because of the nature of posting fits, recent cops etc, while in other boards it&#039;s more down to overarching site culture and people understanding the same jokes, feels etc, but it&#039;s two sides of the same coin. You&#039;d see someone post in WAYWT - which was less embarassing then than now - then be able to identify that same guy in a different thread talking about the new jacket he just got or whatever. At some point the fuccboi general turned into the more genericly titled stupid questions that don&#039;t deserve their own thread as well.",

And yet, it just doesn&#039;t seem to go away. <br><br>It was created to make it look as if these gay men are just got out of their bedroom after a session of gay sex, or are signalling to other gay men to have sex with them.<br><br>Even when the 70s to 90s aesthetic got revived by zoomers, they continue to sag their pants like homosexuals from the 2000&#039;s.<br><br>How do people even find that a comfortable way to wear their pants? You can&#039;t sit down properly because the waist band is digging into your bladder. You can&#039;t squat without the pants slipping below your ass and exposing your ass crack (and digging into your bladder and crotch). You can&#039;t spread your legs because the crotch area of the pants meant to support your balls is hanging near the middle of your thighs.<br><br>Not to mention, it just gives you a disproportionate look, where your torso is too long and legs are too short. There&#039;s nothing good that has come out of this trend, and yet it just doesn&#039;t seem to die.",

Your ancestors all had perfect skin despite never bathing and never paying attention to their skin.<br><br>All you need to do is the following:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Eat a clean whole foods diet that contains plenty of proteins and animal fats. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dairy is a problem for some people and not others. For me it&#039;s cow fat specifically, so I avoid cream and milk, but yogurt and butter gives me no issues. Pay attention to how food affects your break outs.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Get regular cardiovascular exercise. Doesn&#039;t have to be excessive or high intensity.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Get regular sun. Obviously don&#039;t burn your face off, but the sun is good for you and will help regulate your hormones.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Try to reduce stress. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Stop gooning. Cortisol spikes = acne. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Stop washing your face excessively. Once a day with cold water will suffice. Your oil production will regulate itself if you just stop stripping it off 4 times a day. Every time you wash with soap and/or hot water you strip your face of its protective layer and make it easy for bacteria to enter, which causes more acne and dry skin.</span><br><br>Don&#039;t let the Jewish skincare industry convince you that putting a bunch of carcinogenic slop on your face is the only way to happiness. It&#039;s not. It will only make you dependent on them, just like with medications for chronic illnesses in general. You want to treat the root of the problem, not the symptoms, and the root of the problem goes way beyond the surface of your skin.",

How long it is, how tall you are, how wide it is, and how fat you are. <br>If the coat is too long, it makes you look like a kid in his dads clothes. <br>If it&#039;s too short, it just looks cheap.<br>If it&#039;s too wide/loose/baggy, it makes you look shapeless, it should hug the model to a certain amount.<br>If it&#039;s too tight and can&#039;t be buttoned, it makes you look fat, and it makes the coat look cheap.<br><br>You absolutely must wear it with formal clothing, that is the key difference between looking good in one vs looking like a neckbeard. Do not wear jeans, do not wear cargo shorts, do not wear boots, do not wear tshirts.<br>Wear a white or blue collared shirt, wear dress slacks, you can get away without a tie or a suit jacket if you really don&#039;t want to wear one.",

But while that has not yet happened, you can safely wear an overcoat and if you dress like you&#039;re going to the office, people will simply think you&#039;re going to the office even if you are not actually.",

Collabs wth ALD, JFG, Salehe and Casablanca caught fire initially and the Miu Miu and Junya stuff from the last couple PFW are probably the most talked about collabs to be shown at them. Also I feel like while its played out now, the 550s widespread appeal helped New Balance shift from a purely dad shoe brand to selling in more categories, helping them keep the momentum out of that trend cycle and expanding their brand perception. <br><a href=\"#p18487749\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18487749</a><br>Definitely tempted, just wondering if it&#039;s worth waiting for the Kith collab/future collabs or other future colorways.

Look at the material tag and avoid anything that isn&#039;t 100% wool or cotton or linen. Next look at fit, you need the jacket to fit your shoulders and have the jacket in your length. The pants need to at least make it around your waist and close, there&#039;s usually a couple of inches of seam play there. Everything else will likely be able to be adjusted to your body like sleeves and hem length.",

The shelves spanning the back wall offer a minimalist utilitarian aspect, evoking a brutalist aesthetic that speaks to function over frivolity. The light green walls, though humble, present an almost zen-like tranquility, a subtle nod to mid-century modern color palettes but with a grit that grounds the space in realism. The concrete floor, rustic and markedly adorned with scattered red and green paint splashes, functions as an avant-garde canvas, reminiscent of abstract expressionism meets industrial chic. One might see it as a tactile homage to urban art? It&#039;s defiantly unrefined and strikingly authentic. Even the well-worn toilet and sink, with their evident patina and wear, contribute to an honest narrative of lived experience, souvenirs of endurance and stark simplicity. It&#039;s a visceral installation of survivalist elegance, a testament to the beauty found in raw environments stripped to their essentials with an unpretentious honesty few curated spaces dare to embrace. A true sanctuary of unvarnished reality.</span>",

The most prominent title is Duke of Alba de Tormes, which is a Grandee of Spain and considered one of the most aristocratic titles in Spain. In addition to the dukedom, the family holds numerous other titles, including: 12th Duke of Berwick, Liria and J\u00e9rica, 15th Count-Duke of Olivares, 17th Marquis of Carpio, and five countships: Lemos, Ler\u00edn, Miranda del Casta\u00f1ar, Monterrey, and Osorno. They also possess 15 marquisates, 11 counties, 1 viscounty, 1 lordship, and the office of Constable of Navarre, all without Grandeza. <br>Elaboration:<br>The House of Alba&#039;s titles are a mix of ducal, marquisal, countly, and viscountal titles, with the Duke of Alba de Tormes being the most significant. The family&#039;s history is intertwined with major events in Spanish history, and their titles reflect this influence and prominence. <br>Dukedom:<br>The title of Duke of Alba de Tormes was created in 1472 by King Henry IV of Castile for Garc\u00eda \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 2nd Count of Alba de Tormes. <br>Grandeza:<br>The family holds the Grandeza de Espa\u00f1a, a high rank of Spanish nobility, with the Duke of Alba de Tormes being a Grandee. <br>Other Titles:<br>Beyond the dukedom, the House of Alba has accumulated various other titles through inheritance and strategic marriages. These include dukedoms, marquisates, countships, and other noble titles, some with Grandeza and others without. <br>Notable Individuals:<br>Famous members of the House of Alba include Don Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba, who served as governor of the Spanish Netherlands, and Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda del Pilar de Silva, 13th Duchess of Alba, who was a muse of the painter Francisco Goya.",

Boomers were the first generation to ditch suits for more casual clothing. Their children, Gen Y/Millennials, were never taught by their fathers about proper dress codes so they continued the casual trend. Gen X were the grunge generation so enough said there. So by the time lil zoom came along there was no hope left.<br><br>Couple all of the above with tailoring becoming a lost art. Manufacturers cutting costs to the bare minimum, and pushing shitty uncomfortable synthetic suits and we end up here today with the suit getting a bad rep because most people never had a good one to begin with. It&#039;s like comparing a cheap cotton hoody with a wool sweater. Sure they both do the same thing but one is always going to be better than the other.",

I also have always worn real watches most of the time. There are some niche situations where the smartwatch is nice though. I used a previous one while working as a mechanic and it was nice because I could leave my phone on my tool cart where it was safe and then be able to see who was calling or texting me so I could know if it was worth stopping what I was doing and washing up so I could handle my phone and answer. Later, I was in a field where everything was done in UTC time, and a smartwatch with a face like the one in my pic was by far the cheapest way to get a watch with a big easily readable second time zone display. They also have a much more intuitive and quick interface for setting timers etc. than a &quot;dumb&quot; digital/quartz watch while still avoiding the need to take your phone out and use it for that. <br><br>I also just don&#039;t have that phone distraction tendency that a lot of people seem to, though. I only really use mine when I&#039;ve got an actual reason to, or when I&#039;ve genuinely got nothing better to do - stuck in a waiting room or whatever.

When you take the time to prepare your food, you naturally appreciate it more\u2014you slow down, savor each bite, and often end up eating less simply because the experience feels more intentional and rewarding.<br>Just today, I whipped up a quick Asian-style sauce to go with some leftover rice, and it completely elevated a simple meal into something truly satisfying.<br>Another helpful tip: use zero-calorie flavor enhancers like Bolero (which is popular here in Europe). They make drinking water more enjoyable, which not only helps you stay hydrated but can also curb your appetite. Try drinking one or two glasses of water before your main meal\u2014you might find you\u2019re already feeling full before you even finish your plate.",

        "com": "hi kinda new to all this, i had a few questions that i think some of you would have enough experience to answer. at what BMI does it really start to get unhealthy, where you noticeably start to feel weak, and really notice the other effects. currently i&#039;m at around 120 lbs and 5&#039;8&quot;. i mainly wanna lose weight for a better waist. i&#039;m wondering if losing weight at this point will have much of an effect on my waist or if this is the point where losing weight won&#039;t matter much and it&#039;s just up to my genetics. also if i do set a weight goal and get there, how exactly am i supposed to maintain it? dieting for the rest of my life kinda sounds tiring. should i just stop dieting when i get there and start again if i happen to gain too much weight? i&#039;m just trying to get an idea of how it works long term.",

Get to a weight youre happy at and dont exceed 10lbs. 5lb fluctuations can be normal, so weigh in weekly.

(of course, whatever his level of attractiveness, there will be a slight increase as a result of being combined with long hair)<br>- his facial hair has to suit his face for long hair to look good. Most of the time, clean shaven is far superior, and full beard tends to be messy looking, but there are certainly exceptions. If you Odinmaxx, for instance <br>- It must be kept clean and brushed. Hair and facial hair (if applicable) can&#039;t look dirty and scraggly, but also not excessively neat(incredibly gay, and not in the good way). <br>- he must be an interesting and unusual sort of person in some way, or it simply doesn&#039;t align with expectation, which is just disappointing. <br>- the above point also being reflected in his choice of dress. <br><br>bonus point: <br>THE LONGER THE BETTER. seriously long hair on men is much too rare to see. Deeply saddening. <br><br>but as others say, it obviously depends so heavily on the individual woman that all these could be the complete opposite in the mind of someone else, and the average woman is definitely likely to think very differently. However bear in mind that they are mistaken and this post holds the one and only eternal truth. Do with that what you will",

The issue is, I have few experiences socializing and will be learning all of the rules on the spot, meaning I will inevitably make a lot of blunders. My biggest fear right now is that someone will take a picture of me (an uncanny-acting autistic man) doing something retarded and upload it online.<br>To escape this, I&#039;ve been considering perhaps wearing a mask of some sort that&#039;d prevent me from being easily identifiable in public. It would really make me feel less afraid of interacting with new people, and it would allow me to wear shirts that people would find cringe without fear of it haunting me in the future.<br>What sort of mask could I wear? I understand that I would probably call more attention to myself with something too flashy or even with a traditional coof mask (since it reads as something a Reddit conspiracy theorist would wear), so I don&#039;t want to wear one of those. My #1 choice right now is probably the niggerish &quot;sheisty&quot; mask (picrel) because it&#039;s the most normal-seeming, but I&#039;m white and it makes me run the risk of looking like I&#039;m trying to larp as a revolutionary. I can&#039;t think of any popular religions that make men wear face coverings, either, albeit I could probably say it&#039;s for vague &quot;religious reasons&quot; and people probably wouldn&#039;t inquire further. Does anyone have any ideas on what I could do?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 your fear of being captured is irrational</span><br>I&#039;ve seen people get publicly ridiculed for less.

        "com": "I recently embarked on an eyebrow mission and this is what happened in my case and what discovered along the way.<br><br>1. my eyebrows were thin because I didn&#039;t realize I was always fondling and pulling on them, and any number of eyebrow hairs were coming out per day and the biggest part of my problem was me pulling them out. I didn&#039;t really even notice but then until committed to stop. I also tried a few other things.<br>2. using an eyebrow conditioner is worth it, keeps the follicles healthy and stops hair from falling out or breaking as much. I started using an eyebrow conditioner at the beginning when i wanted them to grow back thick and healthy, but nowadays i use a kind of expensive nighttime face moisturizer that has peptides and other good stuff that the conditioner had so i just make sure I rub some in my brows<br>3. actually tried this <a href=\"#p18488467\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;18488467</a> as an experiment. I believe it would have worked if i stuck with it, but I found I kept getting vertigo at night and only when I dabbed that shit in my eyebrows. that means I was absorbing minoxidil into my head somehow (eyes etc) which is a serious health risk and needs to be avoided at all costs. so I stopped with the minoxidil and just stuck with the peptides and moisturiser<br><br>and finally, 4. I bought this stuff on a whim to see if it would ease up on some of my grey hairs (spoiler - it works really well). I used it on my eyebrows once and it actually managed to darken them a little and they look wwwwway thicker now. now this shampoo is a super gradual hair darkener, they say it&#039;ll take 1-2 weeks of daily use to erase a lot of grey hairs, but honestly on my eyebrows I could swear I could tell the difference after one use. I used it for a few days until I was happy and now I think if I use it a coupe times a week it&#039;ll maintain. <br><br>aside from the face moisturizer routine and the not plucking my own brows, all this stuff I did just for fun and as a little project, and I won&#039;t be doing the blending shampoo nonsense forever",

For example frock coats were originally practical military wear that became semi formal town wear, inspired what would become white tie (something the upper class simply wore during the evenings), then was replaced by morning coats during the day which had equestrian origins (split tails for riding) before being finally dying out as being too formal for society anymore. Similarly, the lounge suit was country sportswear, which then became acceptable as daytime dress. Of course black tie would replace white tie, then the lounge suit would become business wear, followed more recently by the trend of dressing up at all being viewed as weird thanks to silicone valley and the pandemic. (I think tech execs being viewed as everyman while wearing $1000 Brioni and Loro Piana t-shirts is a farce but whatever)<br><br>The modern era, with the internet, social media, and ultra fast fashion is warping what is socially &quot;acceptable&quot; faster than ever before, and at this point clothing is a basically a free for all where what&#039;s &quot;in&quot; could exist for merely weeks or days. Gone are the days of the societal uniform for better or worse, but I wonder how that&#039;s going to affect dressing over the long term because even if most people aren&#039;t tiktok dressing, the UFF trends are causing a lot of damage as clothing is a race to bottom in terms of quantity over quality, and it&#039;s affected even brands that should be fashion immune like Carhartt.<br><br>On the subject of formality we&#039;re apparently at the point that tucking in a short sleeve button up shirt with a pair of chinos is now ultra formal wedding wear when that was just maybe church wear or office wear at best when growing up in the 90s. Feels like in the next decade either clothing that survives more than two washes will be formal wear worthy or the pendulum will swing the other direction and formality will be back.",

Many people will not wear chinos unless they are going out to meet people.<br>In terms of shoes, chunky running sneakers are casual but converse or classic sneakers are more formal. Chelsea boots are more formal still.<br>A collared shirt worn unbuttoned and untucked over a tshirt is considered more dressy than just a tshirt.<br><br>This is likely going to continue. flipflops/sandals/slides will become the default shoe with any sort of actual closed shoe being considered formal.<br>Pyjamas have begun to appear in supermarkets, where people simply slide out of bed, get in their car, drive to the shop, buy what they need, then get back in bed, they see no reason to actually get dressed for something so socially unimportant. In fact it has almost become a deliberate fashion choice for some. They will probably start dressing like that for more things and it may become the norm.<br><br>I don&#039;t know what causes this as opposed to the opposite where fashion styles become more formal (ie, people didn&#039;t always wear 3 piece suits, they once wore simpler clothing but at some point the styles must have increased in formality). I suspect it has something todo with the level of seriousness in society, where life is dangerous and severe, it demands a serious approach to life, and with this comes more formal ways of dressing. The classic suit is a military uniform, the peak of severity. <br>Clothing began to casualise immediately after WW2 ended and we entered a time of unparalleled safety and relaxation",

It will signal that you&#039;re experimenting for stylistic purposes, not some sort of ideology reason. It&#039;s kinda dumb, but 30 years ago you could just play around but now with the woke stuff you have the make a point of &quot;I&#039;m a fashion person, not an identity person&quot;.<br><br>The key is to focus on what pieces really call to you; I&#039;d say even knee-length skirts can be worn by a man, but you need to stick with men&#039;s pants when going with pants. The problem is woman&#039;s pants are going to cling to you in socially-awkward ways that draw the wrong kind of attention.<br><br>And when I say &quot;wrong kind of attention&quot;, I&#039;m not talking about gay or straight. I&#039;m talking about people worrying if you&#039;ll want to focus on having a politically aggressive argument.<br><br>The truth is most people in 2025 don&#039;t care which way you swing, or what you identify as, but they are tired of politics being injected into everything. They&#039;re a bit hyper-worried, so it&#039;s important to somehow convey that your deal is soley about fashion and not some kind of a reg flag.",

The problem is there is a strong &quot;trying to follow directions&quot; vibes with your outfits. None of them are technically &quot;wrong&quot; but they look like someone else used you as their model instead of you organically chosing any of it.<br><br>It works as long as you only post it to the internet, I guess, but in real life it&#039;s uncanny and gives a real NPC vibe. My advice is you need to strip back all the accessories of each look and instead wear accessories that are not &quot;on theme&quot; with the outfit. Don&#039;t were fetish-hot topic with fetish hot topic; wear black track pants with the white shirt and non-functional corset. Take the scene kid stuff off the short shorts and look to normcore or &#039;80s preppy. And with the third outfit you need to not wear those two separates together; wear either with a different grey, brown, navy or burgundy piece.<br><br>You have to flex your creative muscles, or people will just think your a weird copycat who might start to steal their fashion style.",

This is to prevent a tired look and eye bags.<br><br>Here\u2019s an outfit I can recommend for you. It\u2019s like a really neutral default. Casual and comfortable that fits like pajamas. It\u2019s not exactly the most stylish, but it\u2019s a good starting point to understand fit and color coordination.<br><br>Fitted cargo jogger pants. They\u2019re like sweatpants only more modern and have more of a taper at the ankles and calves. Kinda like ninja pants. I recommend grey, black, or taupe. I recommend a brand called INC or International Concepts.<br><br>Get a fitted tee in a solid color. No pockets, no V-neck, no patterns. Just a regular cotton tee. Kohls has good regular fitted tees called Apt. 9. Get a grey tee and a blue tee. Make sure to buy your correct size where the shoulder seams sit exactly at your shoulders.<br><br>To start out with shoes, get solid white sneakers. No meme shoes yet. You\u2019re just a beginner. Make sure they\u2019re as minimalist in design with little to no logos.<br><br>The outfit suggestion isn\u2019t flamboyant or expensive, but consider it training wheels to understand proper fit and color. You gotta start somewhere, right? The plus is that the outfit would fit properly and still feel comfortable, even if it seems like gym attire. The objective is to look clean and presentable.<br><br>In regards to your hair, you at least aren\u2019t balding. You just need something that frames your face. Get something with tapered and close sides. Doesn\u2019t matter how long the bangs are. The idea is to properly shape your face and not make it look round. Ask a barber, not a hairstylist, to give you a number one on the sides and to keep bangs. You will have to learn to part it yourself.",

Get a real skin care routine ASAP. Cleanser + SPF in the morning, Cleanser + Moisturizer + Retinoid/Vitamin C in the evening. <br><br>Start supplementing Vitamin D, Magnesium Glycinate. Maybe get your bloodwork done so you can target your deficiencies but eating spinach is a good place to start because you look iron deficient.<br><br>I would style your hair back more. The bangs look too adolescent. The style does not match your skin\u2019s age. Also it is not a bad thing that your face loses fat last. You have some upper eyelid exposure at this bodyweight already and losing fat there will significantly age you.<br><br>For style, I agree that you should aim to dress like a white man. Vintage brooks brothers, j crew, and Ralph Lauren. Not sure why the other guy described it as gorp. Im talking mostly just generic white guy: OCBDs, chinos, loafers, even boat shoes. But don\u2019t buy cheap synthetic golf stuff like vineyard vines or start wearing Columbia vests. And don\u2019t go full trad ivy prep either. We just want clean and normal, non-incel attire.<br><br>Your glasses might be a bit too large for your face.

The fit you posted has really bad proportions that make you look short. Find a boxier thick white tshirt, vintage blue levis, a thick belt, some boots you like. Make it look good. Try to even out your leg to torso ratio. Once you figure that out everything will start to make sense. And remember that fashion is mental, insecurity ruins your appearance.",

If you drink coffee or soda, you probably need to supplement it. Most people do best with glycinate but again, spend some time on google.

Lift Heavy, Lift to Failure. Take a day rest between working out so you can really recover, even just a Push Pull Legs will be okay (although not optimal) to start with. Monday, Rest, Wednesday, Rest, Friday, Rest, Rest. Make sure you are coming close to failing on the last rep of your last set. That made all the difference to me, use the pain you have. <br>Low reps heavy weight on your compound movements such as your Deadlifts, Bench Press, Overhead Press and Dips. Then round out your smaller muscles with Isolation, women LOVE big arms. Be sure to do pullups too, just go watch as much Jeff Nippard videos as you can. He has a great 3x a week Full Body Routine you can find for free by searching google docs.<br><br>Youtube a good skincare routine, I tried for the past 30mins to find the right video but I couldnt, sorry. <br><br>Find a good barber around you and see what they can do for you, do your research and see who is good, has some decent numbers of followers on instagram etc. Talk to him.<br><br>Layer Basics from uniqlo. Try their smart ankle pants or whatever theyre called are OP. Use simple colour pallets like Blacks, Beige, Greys, Navy and Browns. Wear linen in Summer. Maybe watch some Brandon Balfour and see what he does. <br><br>As soon as i changed my glasses to those circle style ones, Holy Shit women just started talking to ME first. <br><br>Also go buy some good colonge, for winter and date night start with Armani Stronger With You Intensley and for summer just buy a cheap freshie, youtube that too. Use Roll On Deoderants btw.<br><br>What youre poor? Go work, yes I know youre sad, you need to go see a therapist too (Seriously) and I know theyre expensive.

The point of these subcultures was to essentially prey on insecurities and profit off of them. Once the subculture dies out within a decade or so, people are told to hop on the next corporate bandwagon and restart the anxiety train.<br><br>Take a look at millennials who were emo years back.

None of them are currently happy with a normal adulthood, effectively being raped of a normal life. Meanwhile, the basic jock and the basic blonde managed to keep it simple and live organic happy lives, eventually starting a family. Their fashion was still rather vanilla consisting of basic blue jeans, athletic apparel, and at most, hair grown to have bangs and nothing longer or edgier.<br><br>Today, look at anyone who\u2019s alternative be they a TikTok goth, a pastel slut, a twitch cosplay whore, or a femboy. None of them are happy. They are chronically online living artificial lives, and suffering the same fate as the millennial emo from 20 years ago, only faster. Milestones missed in life trying to out subculture their peers resulting in an early midlife crisis.<br><br>Let\u2019s also not forget that every subculture was designed to be self-destructive.

        "com": "People in the know have never fucked with Loro Piana&#039;s Ready to Wear. What made the company famous was their textiles. You would go to your tailor and get something made in Loro Piana fabric. The company was founded in 1924 as a Textile Mill but didn&#039;t start doing Ready to Wear until the 80&#039;s when the Great Grandsons of the founder took over and basically went scam mode. The Ready to Wear from the moment it was conceived was poorly made crap that was just a means to use up their overstock fabrics. It was never meant for the discerning bespoke customer that ordered Loro Piana fabrics from their tailor. It was meant for NMP&#039;s (New Money Peabrainlets). <br><br>But the world is full of NMP&#039;s and the Ready to Wear did well and eventually LMVH came knocking. This was the real death knell of the company. Up until 2013 Loro Piana still made great fabrics and you could just ignore the kitschy Ready to Wear they did for dilettantes. But after LVMH got majority control of the company everyone knew the fabrics division would wither and die.<br><br>So even the people in the know who still used Loro Piana fabrics basically got out over 10 years ago, and switched to other storied Italian mills that have stayed family owned. Nobody who knew anything about real luxury or the Italian fashion industry was surprised about this. Only NMP&#039;s are shocked.",

The buckle is too feminine IMHO, and they are super expensive and use the roughest toughest and thick leathers, that isn&#039;t too comfortable. I also think that it&#039;s because they are easy to put on and off but for that same purpose I rather wear Chelsea boots.

You&#039;ll get plenty of airflow through the gaps between the buttons. They&#039;ll also not look worse with age. T-shrits get stretched out and get floppy collars over the years.

But I work in the morning and she has a schedule where she works in the afternoon and evening every day for a week and then she&#039;s off for a full week, so on her work weeks she sleeps in while I get ready and go to work and then isn&#039;t home when I get home, so we don&#039;t really have a time where we just sit and chill those days. I just want to throw my work watch on, got to work, come home from work, throw a play watch on and play, then go to bed when she comes home.<br><br>That kind of plays into why manual wind is so great for special occasion dress watches. If you only wear a watch for a day or two at a time a couple times a year you only have to wind it once before you put it away again. It&#039;s not a problem at all.

Most divers wear a dive computer as I already said, and something like a smartwatch or a G-Shock as a backup in case the computer fails. No one wears mechanical watches for diving anymore unless you&#039;re a watch enthusiast. And if you are, any Seiko diver or other watch like it will be just fine. And saying it&#039;s a backup is mostly just so people don&#039;t look at you like you&#039;re crazy for wearing one. I just say Casio because chances are you aren&#039;t going to need it if you just want a watch that will survive the water. But if you want to buy a diver and say you went diving with it, buy whatever you like and don&#039;t pretend it&#039;s for utility. It&#039;s for the flex. I have nothing against dive watches, just people who won&#039;t admit it&#039;s for the style points.",

Footwear all I have are some tennis shoes, white adidas hightops and beige palladiums. You get the vibes im trying?

Sporting a new lens, the creative opted to capture dynamic street style, shooting random passers-by as they commuted. While rather uneventful, interest would peak as a vagrant man strut forth in an oversized trench coat, baggy jeans and complimenting rope belt. His slender profile drew attention to a unique temperament and razor-sharp jawline, in light of unforgettable cheekbones. </span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Having captured an array of in-motion stills, Tu would upload each to the online forum \u2018Fengniao\u2019 which he frequented. A month later, his work was reposted on a similar forum thread alongside a caption that roughly translated to \u201cBehold the number one ultimate, gorgeous, handsome passer-by! Blind your dog eyes! Seeking detailed information on his flesh.&quot; Other commenters would shower him with similar compliments, glorifying his unique style and \u201csharp\u201d features before plaguing him as Brother Sharp.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Within five days the post amassed millions of views, prompting users to locate the mysterious man. Found outside of a bookstore, it was confirmed Guorong was in fact homeless and \u201cmentally disturbed\u201d. As a result of such notoriety, he would be admitted to a hospital and reunited with his long-lost family, beginning a slow road to recovery. His younger brother revealed that nearly a decade prior he had departed from home in search of work after a fatal car crash took both his wife&#039;s and father\u2019s life, sending the vagrant in a downward spiral.</span>",
