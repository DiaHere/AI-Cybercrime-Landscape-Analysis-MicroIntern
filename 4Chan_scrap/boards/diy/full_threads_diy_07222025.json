That way the steady-state voltage across the workpiece is zero, regardless of power supply voltage. Short mitigation would be more difficult, but assuming the ESR of the inductor is higher than the workpiece shorted resistance it would easily be measurable. If not you could still have live AC impedance measurement of the inductor/workpiece, or just eat the momentary short with the transistor and rely on the total ESR to limit current.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Well one use case is definately contouring</span><br>You could do that with 4-axis wire EDM too, like those CNC foam cutters that move either end of the hot-wire around, or with a synchronous rotary axis. That wouldn\u2019t be a job for Marlin though. Sure you don\u2019t want to cram GRBL on that Mega2560 Ramps board?<br><br>ECM would need a much thicker wire anyhow to take the higher current, so maybe impacts wouldn\u2019t be an issue. I\u2019d suggest to use a titanium wire, it\u2019s strong and pretty good in electrochemistry, but whatever you pick would need to be immune to electroplating.<br><br>Is the mainboard underneath the bed in this printer of yours? It would be a water leak risk.",

The heating type in question is already radiant a small space it doesn&#039;t really matter so much as the amount of time you continuously output the heat. It&#039;s moving enough airflow just by being hot that that little fan isn&#039;t going to amount to much. It would unironically be better to use the space on top for pots of water or wax to act as mass heaters/heat capacitors when the fire finally goes out.<br><br>The best blower fireplace types are the triple walled ones that blow from the back/top/under/around the fireplace which helps maintain the fireplace itself and outputs a tremendous amount of heat because all the surfaces are effectively cooled. You will have more efficiency by running a higher airflow to reach areas of your house that your other heating doesn&#039;t because it can utilize more heat that would have been wasted up the chimey.

You don&#039;t actually have to use hardwoods but it will last considerably longer if you do. The plastic laminate can be replace with any non-brittle plastic which can be found for free all over the place but you can also skip it, it just reduces friction some. <br><br>One thing that image does not show is that the the center pin goes into a work board, so you have a 20x20cm or what ever sized hunk of plywood with a hole a size of your center pin drill through the center, drill a hold that size through your stock and then put the center pin through your stock and the work board, turn until cut. <br><br>This basic design can be adapted to work down to 5 or 6 cm. For smaller I can draw up a quick plan for you if you are actually willing to make these. You can also buy them, just search for guitar sound hole cutters, but these will not get you the smaller holes. <br><br>If you can&#039;t have a hole in the center of your disc or need it as small as possible the design could be adapted, would need to think on it a little for the best way to go.",

You could hide it entirely by screwing from the top before tiling.<br>If you&#039;ll excuse the DaveCAD I&#039;ll try to explain how you&#039;d hide all the shenanigans. You drill 2 (or more) sets of countersunk holes in the MDF with the front being the exact diameter of the screw so it can&#039;t move, and the back being oblong so the screw can move as the oak shrinks and expands underneath the MDF. That way the tiled MDF plate says aligned with the front. Same things for the sides, of course, since you&#039;re tiling all the way around.<br>I wouldn&#039;t bother with the expansion gap on the top then. Just join the oak top directly to the oak sides with dowels or whatever you were going to and it&#039;ll be solid. It will not move meaningfully in that direction.<br>It&#039;s gonna be egregiously expensive and I don&#039;t know about your assertion that you won&#039;t have to worry about cutting square. You&#039;re definitely going to want to plane all the inaccuracies off once you&#039;re done assembling it.",

Once you have the saw exactly where you want it and you know the speedsquare is Square against the board Clamp that in place. Set your blade height exactly where you want it, use digital calipers if you need to. Lock it in place good. Make sure the shoe of your saw is 90\u00b0s to the blade. Start making cuts from the outside, slow and deliberate. This is not a quick and easy method for half laps, it&#039;s really tedious and a lot can go wrong. Better methods are a router, table saw or a router table. You could easily do this exact same setup but use a router instead of a circular saw and get much better results. You can also use a router for finger joints, dados, etc.",

You\u2019ll need to take the time to set and sharpen it if this is the case. Plenty of videos exist on how to do this but you\u2019ll need a set of saw files, a hammer, a lil anvil (a second hammer in a vise works fine), saw set pliers, and enough patience to do a 10 minute job. If you\u2019re using some hardened metal saw from Home Depot throw that thing away and buy a brass backed tenon saw. Spear &amp; Jackson makes a great cheap one that lasts fucking forever.<br>Alternatively: pic related is another great option for any delicate cuts and it requires no tuning up because blades are replaceable. But blades break easily and they\u2019re more expensive in the long run.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;B) you are gorilla gripping it and flexing your wrist causing it to deviate</span><br>A saw needs to be held like a little baby bird. Someone should be able to snatch it out of your hand at any moment mid-cut. Carefully establish the kerf, and let the saw do the work. Stop going monke mode and go monk mode instead.<br>If it\u2019s not doing the work it fast enough, put a little machine oil on it. If it still isn\u2019t cutting like it should, see the fix in option &gt;A)<br><br>Shit is not rocket science when you figure it out.",

You&#039;re convinced you need to spend an inordinate amount of time and effort on that shit because you&#039;ve never practiced free-hand. You can train your body to be the machine, bro. It&#039;s not hard, but it does require time and discipline. People been doing it since the beginning of man. You&#039;re basically saying &quot;I&#039;m too weak to do it myself&quot;. Not everything needs to be a fine piece of woodworking, either. Sometimes ya just gotta slap some shit together for a project so you can get done what needs doing and then you take it apart or adapt it to some other use. The difference between a craftsman and you is that you are absolutely worthless without your own special tools and you take forever. Someone who understands the art innately can make anything work and it&#039;ll look and work great.",

Glad to see you have everything mounted. Just a comment, mounting your antenna like that so close to the body of the van tends to de-tune the antenna and you may also get some weird signal patterns and reduced performance. Best is to get the base of the antenna at roof level or mount those on your sideview mirrors. But the way you have it now is better than nothing.",

This was in the era of the hit tv series &#039;Emergency!&#039; which I was a big fan of, so it was pretty neat to me. Nowadays about 50% of the calls they go to are drug overdoses. Druggies are real pieces of shit. But I digress..<br><br>As for emergency comms as public service, our first responders are pretty much independant and set up well with back-up systems, generators, etc. It would be rare to get the amateur service involved here unless they wanted to use our repeaters due to their own radio circuits being overloaded. Or to send some ham into a remote town that has all comms cut off.<br><br>In my region we&#039;re mostly thinking of a 1964 Alaska earthquake/tsunami-like event. We suspect we&#039;ll act as messengers like the old telegraph system. Basically someone stuck in one town wants to send a message to mom in the next town over saying they&#039;re fine but running low on clean underwear. That kind of thing.<br><br>In all these years so far only once have I had to provide emergency communications. That was when the phone system failed for 9 hours in the next town over.",

As a result, you can cause a lot more interference and damage. It happens more than what you think. There are dipshits who tie up a repeater during an emergency net for non-emergency reasons. CB, GMRS, and MURS, everything is already done for you. The power limits, the channels, the bandwidth, etc. This is to prevent you from causing interference. <br><br><a href=\"#p2931872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2931872</a><br>Your dad is a pretty cool guy for that. The fire dept here hasn&#039;t lost it&#039;s respect, but like yours, there were a lot of thefts so they also had to lock up.<br><br><a href=\"#p2932068\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2932068</a><br>Drug overdoses here are so common.

One of the ARES members here has a perpetual JS8call station up that was used as a relay and message storing during last year&#039;s hurricanes. He also took messages from families in the disaster zones and called their loved ones away from that area to say they were okay. I have respect for ARES itself. It does its job.

This happens via the solar cycle, where sunspots from our giant nuclear reactor in the sky charge ions in our ionosphere. These create a &quot;mirror&quot; that allow signals to reflect back down to earth. <br><br>This cycle lasts ~11 years. During the peak, the ionosphere is greatly charged, often coming with solar storms that can knock out communications, but also allowing for amazing radio propagation in bands like 6m, 10m, 11m, and within reason up to 20m. Band conditions change constantly throughout the day and night, so what wavelengths operate the best may not last all day. Some bands like 40m and 80m are great night time bands, and they have atmospheric propagation during the downturn of the cycle. So when the solar cycle dips during it&#039;s 11 year mestral period, longer wavelengths become more prominent. This means bands like 20m, 30m, 40m, 60m, and 80m. Bands like 40m and 80m are also very reliable as they almost always have some level of propagation at night, though there are definitely times where theres no propagation anywhere.<br><br>This means right now 10m and 11m are hot, and there&#039;s a ton of activity. In a couple years they will die, and longer wavelengths (thereby requiring longer antennas at higher heights, especially for dx) become king. Most amateur operators have numerous bands in their arsenal. I personally (usually) have 10m, 20m, and 40m at all times, though I just recently moved so I don&#039;t have anything up yet. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When it comes to HF radios, can I see a CB whip and coax or do they require an entirely different setup</span><br>I&#039;ve hooked coax to a chainlink fence and made contacts.

If you imagined the signals as visible waves of light, 40m would be (rounded) 120ft tall, while 10m would be (rounded) 30ft tall. Shorter wavelengths have more energy density and therefore interact with their environment differently. Long wavelengths punch through water like it doesn&#039;t exist, same with trees for example. Short wavelengths (such as uhf or microwave signals) interact heavily with moisture and water. That&#039;s how your home microwave heats food, a microwave radio transmitter slapping radio signals into a Faraday cage that interact with moisture. This interaction is converted into heat. No aliens, no nuclear devices, no deadly radiation like Hollywood would have us believe (American horror story I&#039;m looking at you.) <br><br>On the flip side, short wavelengths such as UHF and blast through the ionosphere regardless of what the sun&#039;s opinion is, attenuated or not. This makes it optimal for satellite work. However, it is heavily attenuated by things like rain, clouds, and trees.",

He mounted a CB antenna on his back-right bumper like yours (your pic reminded me of his set-up) with the antenna only a couple inches from the body and hardtop. He complained to me of hearing nothing at all. My antenna analyzer showed that his antenna didn&#039;t resonate anywhere near the CB frequencies so not only was the antenna radiating very little RF but the high SWR was reflecting most of it back into his radio. I brought out my old Radio Shack TRC-211 hand-held CB and we could hear each other in close proximity confirming his radio was working. I wish I had a field strength meter, I was curious what kind of antenna pattern he had.<br><br>He bought it for off-road use. I told him unless he has a buddy with one the odds are long that at a random time and place he will find someone using one and then you&#039;d have to figure out which of the 40 channels they are using. A scanning feature helps with this which his radio didn&#039;t have.<br><br>Otherwise I suggested he relocate his antenna by clamping it to his rollbar or a magmount on his hood. And set his CB to ch 9 or 19.<br><br>What you could do is whenever you see someone with a CB, approach and ask what the best channel is and if anyone is using them. I do this periodically and have had positive results.",

I&#039;ve heard soda stream cartridges aren&#039;t really ideal for dispensing before and am wondering if anyone has experience here. <br>I used to manage a bar and know how to set up keg and gas lines so the reason I&#039;m considering the kit isn&#039;t that it&#039;s fully assembled, but whether it&#039;s cheaper than buying all the components separately.",

Currently I just have a cellar that&#039;s slightly colder than room temp which would be fine for English bitters or stouts. I&#039;m thinking a 9L keg refrigerated overnight, with the rest of the batch bottled, would be a lot nicer than putting all my brew in a single keg at just below room temperature. I don&#039;t really have the space or budget to jury rig a separate fridge just for a beer keg.",

The United Kingdom has the world&#039;s highest per capita consumption, as well as the largest cider-producing companies. Ciders from the South West of England are generally higher in alcoholic content.[2][3][4] Cider is also popular in many Commonwealth countries, such as India, South Africa, Canada, Australia,[5][6] New Zealand,[7] and New England.[8] As well as the UK and its former colonies, cider is popular in Portugal (mainly in Minho and Madeira), France (particularly Normandy and Brittany), northern Italy (specifically Friuli), and northern Spain (specifically Asturias and Basque Country). Germany also has its own types of cider with Rhineland-Palatinate and Hesse producing a particularly tart version known as Apfelwein. In the U.S. and Canada, varieties of alcoholic cider are often called hard cider to distinguish it from non-alcoholic apple cider or &quot;sweet cider&quot;, also made from apples. In Canada, cider cannot contain less than 2.5% or over 13% absolute alcohol by volume.[9] </span><br>just americans being weird i guess. english is not my first language as i said, it&#039;s a bit confusing so bear with me<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cider? no i meant that cider</span><br>ffs, just call it apple juice",

Literally nobody but super old people who lived through the prohibition call cider hard cider. Go to any shartmart and you&#039;ll find ten different apple juices in the juice aisle clearly labeled apple juice. You&#039;re unlikely to find cider being sold. Marketers pushed cider extremely hard about ten year ago and spent a lot of money on advertising, but Americans just don&#039;t like cider so they dropped it as suddenly as they started pushing it. If you are lucky you can find a major retailer like Walmart with one cider, angry orchard. The rest you&#039;d have to visit specialty wine and beer stores if you want a different cider.",

I would be large enough to fit 2 small kegs and 2 bar taps mounted on a tiny bar with an outline to an exterior Co2 tank. Kegs would be chilled in the fridge 24 hours before I intend to tap them and they will hopefully stay cool at least 12 hours in the insulated coolbox.",

I removed them to clean the dust and found mold in the duct board and drywall. I cleaned it and had a guy come out and he explained the mexicans who built the house did not properly seal the vents and boots from the attic where the HVAC is located. He checked the plenum and says he found mold there too. He is recommending we replace the plenum with a metal one and also wants to look inside the other intake boxes and check the coil. <br><br>I have been waiting for him to email me a quote since Thursday. I guess he is really busy. In the meantime can I just replace or repair these boots myself? I am pretty handy but its a matter of knowing what material to get and where to get it. I don&#039;t really want to put in new duct board as much as I would rather replace with a metal boot that goes all the way to the vent. Do they sell these at home depot? Any advice on the way to do this is appreciated. Also any recommendations on replacing the plenum with a metal one or not. Pics incoming.",

It&#039;s basically straw rope (rye straw - wheat and barley are too short to work properly) rolled into shape and sewn together with split willow, then covered in a mixture of cow dung (for the short fibers, horse or sheep could also work), lay (for the binder) and a small amount of burnt chalk (to stop rot).<br>Main problem is that you can&#039;t adjust the size. You either make them way to big, which increases the risk of your bees freezing in winter, or they&#039;ll be too small during summer and you&#039;ll have swarms pretty much every day. Modern bees are just bred to way too high performance.<br>Working with them is also a pain. You either need twice as many as you have colonies, &quot;drumming&quot; the bees into a new skep whenever you want o harvest honey (and killing the colony if they were just raising a new queen), or you need to use a L-shaped blade to cut off just the honey part of the comb (which is a pain to do, as the bees will attack you the whole time).<br>I started with a trad hive, and haven&#039;t regretted changing to a modern design even once.<br><br><a href=\"#p2912327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2912327</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;don&#039;t be a hobbyist beekeeper, because they&#039;re disease breeders.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t. honeyjew</span><br>Half the &quot;professional&quot; large-scale beekeepers I know refuse to treat for varroa at all bcs muhexpenses, and constantly have to deal with fungal brood diseases. None of the hobbyists have those problems.<br>Also, Langstroth worked with movable frames, like modern hives have, but did so in such a terrible manner that his work was outdated within a few years. Half the chemicals he uses are impossible to get nowadays (not that you really need them - smoke and water suffice), and his hive setup massively increases the risk of accidentally crushing the queen compared to both more modern designs and traditional (= non-moveable comb) hives.",

These bees are educated in the advanced geometry required to create the perfectly structured hexagonal cells that make up the comb. This education comes from the University of Beekeeper Geometry, where bees learn about efficiency, angles, and space optimization, ensuring that each cell is perfectly sized for honey storage and brood. Without these trained bees, the comb would be poorly constructed and inefficient, leading to wasted resources like wax and space.<br><br>Old comb is valuable because it already contains this optimized structure. Bees can build on top of the old comb, saving time and energy. Rebuilding from scratch would require the bees to have to &quot;re-learn&quot; all the math behind proper comb design, which could be a major setback. By preserving the old comb, beekeepers ensure that bees don&#039;t need to start from zero every time they rebuild their hive. In fact, the more experienced a hive is, the better it can reuse and adapt the old comb.<br><br>Without math bees, the hive would lose its ability to produce efficient comb, impacting the entire colony&#039;s productivity. So, keeping old comb is essential for maintaining a healthy, efficient hive. It\u2019s not just about reusing wax\u2014it\u2019s about holding onto the intricate, mathematically optimized design that allows bees to thrive.",

Fortunately it just brushed off, as I kind of figured it would, but I also didn&#039;t know, like it was high speed, high torque spinning. It was something I never thought would happen but it did. <br> <br>Rotating shafts on for example farm equipment are also absolutely deadly. I&#039;ve seen enough rotating shaft accidents and mutilations to be scared to be within a 10 foot vicinity of a rotating shaft. A bit of loose clothing is all it needs - it grabs the clothing and it doesn&#039;t fucking let go, soon your limbs are all around the shaft getting made into mince meat literally. <br><br>Anyway sorry for the tangent but the point is things that look safe can be extremely deadly. And things that you believe you&#039;ll never allow occur can occur. You think it&#039;s hard with ladies today just wait until you lose an arm.",

By definition, they must be; they&#039;re all the same node, and a single electrical node cannot have more than one voltage at a given time. In reality, there is a slight difference due to the non-ideal nature of real conductors, but it&#039;s very small.<br><br>For series strings of cells (or groups of cells), your practical limitation is mostly voltage. Your number of choices in ADCs and/or multiplexers becomes greatly limited above about 30V, never even mind the high-voltage packs often seen in vehicles. At that point, the obvious move is to simply have individual modules that can track the state of, say, 4-12 cell groups. Those then communicate with a central controller that&#039;s galvanically isolated from them, usually via optocouplers, though some us inductive coupling (I think the Leaf&#039;s BMS does this).<br><br>I actually spent a lot of time designing a BMS (which will never see the light of day, now) that could do 18-cell strings and be linked with itself to create arbitrarily high voltage packs. This was back when the Rona was in full swing and everyone and their mother was backordered for 8 months or more on their BMS chips. I discovered one of the major problems with the &quot;one module per cell&quot; approach was ensuring consistent voltage measurements between cell groups. The only way to do it is to have very precise references, which balloons the cost of the system when you need one for every cell. I ended up creating my own analogue mutiplexer using a flying capacitor, instead. It should have worked, but it adds a shitton to the BoM. After the chip shortage was over, it was just straight-up worse than using one of TIs integrated chips.",

Weaker cells experience slightly more voltage drop internally, which causes them to provide less of the total current being drawn from the cell group.

Yes, it&#039;s technically less efficient, but I&#039;d wager that you&#039;re looking at less than 0.5% of the pack&#039;s total energy being wasted, at worst.

In it&#039;s current iteration I have 20x 3000 mF 25V electrolytic capacitors all wired in parallel. I started out with just 10 but early tests made me think it needed a little more juice. I also bought an additional 50x 1000 mF 25V caps that I can install as well if I need to. I have 2 prongs of solid copper wire (I think 16 or 18 gauge) connected to some stranded wire to act as probes. I talked to a retired EE and he suggested I might try using some TIG welding tungsten instead of copper because it would be considerably less ablative. I haven&#039;t actually tried welding anything to a cell yet, so far I&#039;ve just been testing it by welding nickle strips together, which it seems able to do. Sometimes it doesn&#039;t get enough heat, and sometimes it blows a hole in it. I think part of it is the technique.<br><br>The other is a very stupid/fun project. I&#039;m making an external battery for my laptop using a bunch of Ni-MH AA cells. I&#039;ve got a total of 64 cells in the current version. It&#039;s got 8 cell series holders that are wired together so that there&#039;s 2 sets of 4 in parallel and then those 2 sets are in series, then a buck/boost converter with an adjustable input voltage cutoff to dial it up to the 19.5V or 20V that most of my laptops take. I cut the end off of a broken charger or a cheap knockoff one from ebay and solder that onto the output of the converter. I&#039;ve tested it briefly and it does seem to work, but I haven&#039;t tried testing how long it will actually last. The thing that I think is really funny is that the computer thinks it&#039;s plugged into AC power. When depleted the idea is to pop all the cells out and recharge them in a regular AA charger.<br><br>I&#039;ll have to post pics of these.",

I don&#039;t think I need to explain why that&#039;s bad, and it&#039;s the major reason I&#039;d advice against mixing and matching good/bad cells, even if you can get each parallel group well-matched in terms of capacity and average health.",

The conductors are a hundredth the cross-sectional area of the hypothetical one in the example (actually closer to 250x, but whatever), therefore the voltage drop will be much greater and you win.<br><br>Oh, wait, the ridiculous original Tesla battery made of 7000+ 18650s had parallel groups of 74 cells and peaked at ~550A. That&#039;s only about 7.4A per cell. Meaning, realistically, if there was a bad cell that was supplying literally NO current, there would only be a 0.12V difference in drop between the fuse carrying nominal load and the fuse carrying NOTHING. More reasonably, if you had a bad cell supplying, say, 3/4 to 1/2 of the current the rest of the group is, you&#039;d be looking more in the range of 30-60mV of drop difference. Very easily a level argued to be &quot;small&quot;.<br><br>And I can&#039;t help but point out this is using an example where the cell&#039;s connections are SPECIFICALLY designed to be high-resistance, because they&#039;re FUSES. Tesla is one of the only battery manufacturers that even does this. The vast majority of batteries have far lower-resistance connections between cells, easily dropping those drop numbers into the single-digit millivolt or even microvolt range.<br><br>Again, referring back to the original point because you are absolutely the type to try and argue this into a completely tangential and irrelevant rabbithole to try and &quot;win&quot;: There is not and cannot be a significant difference in cell terminal voltage in parallel groups connected by typical, low-resistance conductors, such as the flat strips or bus bars used in real-world batteries.",

Once you have the individual cell groups together, you can simply charge the groups to similar voltage, put the battery together, and the BMS will take care of any minor remaining disparity. Don&#039;t drain the battery until it has.<br><br>If you&#039;re doing something incredibly fucking stupid and you actually mean 300 cells in parallel, then the process is basically the same.

        "com": "Anons, I&#039;d like to build a small smart power strip controlled by a small ESP32 where I can use a special sketch to &quot;time&quot; the various Schuko sockets. Basically, it&#039;s all relatively simple. The ESP runs a tiny web server that allows you to monitor, turn on/off, and time the various sockets. Obviously, I can&#039;t run 230AC at 16A on the ESP, so I was thinking of using relays, but I hate the fact that they consume current to stay energized and then close the contact (which also consumes energy). So I was thinking of bistable relays, perhaps step-by-step ones that open or close the contacts with each incoming pulse, effectively consuming energy only when needed.<br><br>On paper, it should sound good. Let&#039;s also consider the fact that I&#039;d like to power the ESP32 and the various relays with a battery pack (or a power bank) that can be recharged when the batteries run out, so as not to further impact consumption.<br><br>I can&#039;t find any Arduino-powered relays online right now, and I don&#039;t know if they exist. Any suggestions?",

But you only want an on-off switch, so having 2/7 live when there&#039;s nothing connected to it is pointless (and possibly dangerous if you have the terminals dangling around), so it&#039;s better to have AC live input on 4/5, that way only 3/6 and 4/5 can ever be energized and 2/7 are safe to dangle. If you design your PCBs well, this is a non-issue either way, but it&#039;s maybe better to err on the side of caution.",

You have only one as far as I can tell and you do you but most people wouldn&#039;t name &#039;the&#039; single axis anything specific and conventionally start naming at &#039;X&#039; or, if I&#039;m getting your drawing correctly, call it &#039;Z&#039; in accordance with convention to imply it&#039;s vertical.<br>So is it correct that you&#039;re looking to have a camera hanging from something (like a cart on a taut horizontal rope, or a drone flying level, etc.) move fast in the horizontal plane while following arbitary ground contour at a set distance over ground?<br>In that case I would look at laser or ultrasound ranging and attach a sensor at the very bottom. Look at those very cheap arduino (ultrasound(?)) ranging sensors, maybe thex have the bandwidth you need, if not pay more. Then add either a window comparator or a microcontroller that has only one task: Control a linear actuator so that the distance to ground minus set value is always at 0. Easy as.<br>Next step will be determining all the parameters you need to handle: What rate of error does the thing need to be able to follow, what bandwidth, acceleration and speed results from that and what does that mean in terms of forces involved. Then choose the exact type of actuator and sensor you&#039;ll need. Faster stuff might be easier and even cheaper to control properly on microcontrollers over window comparator.",

You should look very deeply into the red tape, because it&#039;s genuinely better to build new if you want to have a modern, livable interior. Otherwise you&#039;d need a complete new roof, then probably drywall over everything from the inside and insulate from the inside including hydroinsulation, or completley dig up the one side that&#039;s in the hill, hydroisolate, same for ground floor, lay new concrete, new windows, run plumbing and power, more drywall, EWI, ??? and then you still have a structure with dubious wall solidity.<br>For /diy/ability, yeah you can do a lot more and more easily when there&#039;s a standing structure like this as opposed to nothing, but like, the end result will be appropriate for the amount of money and effort spent. If you plan to spend the rest of your life there, and you&#039;re making some half decent money, then save up a bit more and get a new build. You can still /diy/ a lot of shit on a new build to save money, ie. complete heating, EWI, most of electrical (provided you&#039;re not retarded).",

Since it&#039;s made from what looks to be well fitted granite it&#039;s probably going to be and remain structurally sound for quite a while.<br><br>Granite is going to be a bitch and a half to work with as far as recesses for plumbing/wiring is concerned. Plus it won&#039;t really hold plaster. So I&#039;d go with flush mounted everything. That way you&#039;ll only have to drill holes to get through walls.<br><br>Heating is dependent on the local climate. If its indeed mediterranean and you don&#039;t mind cold showers you can go with a solid fuel stove. Get a big cooking range type one with a compartment for heating water. That way you can occasionally enjoy the luxury of a hot bath. You&#039;ll need lots of storage for fuel outside. If there&#039;s nothing you will have to build a big-ish shed. If you&#039;ve got 4 acres of land that &#039;s absolutely possible, though.<br><br>There&#039;s just one serious problem: utility hookups. You&#039;re going to need electricity, water mains and a sewer connection or a septic tank. All of that will require at least some digging. Potentially a lot. That digging - and possibly (((hookup fees))) as applicable in the area - is expensive and may end up setting you back another 20k on top of the purchase price right away.",

In the north the winters are very wet, in the south summer heat will result in condensation on the granite walls.<br>For a full renovation install concrete floor beams with insulation and build interior walls (brick, not wood) with rockwool insulation between the wall and the granite leaving ventilation room between granite and insulation. The insulation should be covered in foil (vapour-open).<br>Roof can be made with insulated roofboards, reusing the tiles.<br>Use aluminium window frames, those are more resistant to sun/moisture than wood or plastic.",

There are recipes online for this that you can find which I won&#039;t get into here (eg research papers testing mix properties).<br><br>Finer aggregates and lower water ratios improves moisture resistance. The stochiometric water/cement ratio is roughly .35 in theory for both to be fully consumed, but the best performance actually comes from using slightly less water under the stochiometric ratio, for tighter packing density and more thixotropic consistency that will make it easier to apply and adhere to vertical surfaces (up to the point where tighter packing density no longer makes up for less polymerization and the curve in the graph stars going back down). Many recipes use extra water to make mixing and pouring easier but this is not really applicable to this use-case. Mortar the inside and outside to close up drafts, and seal it with a lithium or potassium based silicate hardener. Then if you want more weathering protection you can apply a second layer of thin adobe on top of the mortar, and seal it with silicate paint. This serves as a &#039;bearing surface&#039; that can be easily reapplied removed and repaired, preserving the more permanent underlayer from ice or heat damage.<br><br>The roof probably has leaks in it. I think metal roofs are the best in most cases, but if you like the look of the shingles you can use the same mortar to seal and reapply them as well.<br><br>Depending on how much work you are willing to invest you can put underground air pipes to a remote ventshack for cooling/heating intake air to ~65 degrees freedom as well (reduces energy needed for conditioning).<br><br>Does that thing have a basement?

And a damp wall is a cold wall that will negate a lot of insulatiuon you might add. Educate yourself on non hydraulic lime and how it needs to be used. Don&#039;t consider hydraulic limes - they really aren&#039;t that permiable/breathable as they need to and most historic building surveyors now see them as inappropriate for most existing masonry buildings. <br>If you do it right the building should have passive dehumidification properties.<br>The material is cheap, but it&#039;s a learning curve.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t. lime wall and decorative plasterer</span>",

Everyone has something different to say about lime. Mostly because it is all (yes, all) very different. I would focus on getting mature lime putty. That&#039;s the stuff you actually need. You can mature it yourself or buy it. If you want to mature it yourself get whatever is local and let it mature for three years minimum. Make a big pit. Keep it covered with water. Otherwise I agree that a lime plaster would be perfect.",

If you have any tools and skill you can cut them up and join them together to make a decent raised garden bed. Where I live they cost about $3.50-$4 per 5/8&quot; thick x 6&#039; long x 5.5&quot; wide plank. Board and batten style goes a long way to increase durability. Build them to be well draining; put holes in the bottom, put a wire mesh over the holes and then put gravel in the bottom and use a well draining soil mix. Potting soil can be pretty hit or miss. At least cut it with things like lava rock, pumice and bark. The local nursery sells cedar planter boxes for $200+ and they&#039;re slapped together by thirdies using what looks like cedar pickets and a few select pieces of cedar 2x material.",

I am using a Biblical theme of naming the first 3 robots I make Adam, Eve, and Abel. The goal is for these robots to have human body inspired musculoskeletal systems, advanced AI, and that they look human and pass for human to a casual observer at least at a distance. They must be able to walk, talk, run, dance, do sports, do chores, manufacture products, and make more robots just like themselves if not even better. My aim is to build a single robot arm and head and then add sufficiently advanced AI to that arm and head to enable it to build the rest of its own body for me. This way I am delegating the work of building the majority of my first humanoid robot to that robot rather than doing that work myself - and this is to save me time.<br><br>In a like manner, my goal with the AI is to code just enough AI that the AI can begin coding itself and this way I don&#039;t have to code most of the AI myself because it will self create itself. I liken this to building a seed and that seed growing into a tree because for me to code that tree would take too long for me and just creating the seed would then save me time.",

The point of that was to use as little space as possible but I just don&#039;t trust it. I am not sure what material it is made of and my experience with rubber bands has always been dry rot issues. I am going with 2mm OD tension spring instead. It has to stretch 12.5&quot; and so I&#039;m using a 12.7&quot; strip of it to start. That feels like a snug stretch but does comfortably reach the 12.5&quot; of stretch needed. This brings its stretched total length to 25.2&quot;. I bought 3mm ID 4mm OD TPFE tubing to be its guidance tube for this. That arrives tomorrow and then I can begin assembly.<br><br>This 4mm OD guidance tube is a bit bulky and long for the arm IMO so I will relocate it to the torso since if I use this method for other motors these 4mm OD tubes will add up in space taken up fast. The arm can&#039;t house them - it&#039;s just too much space taken at that point for these. But the torso can house them in the back or sides I think. For now, since the torso is not yet attached, I&#039;m going to place this tube ON the string suspended from my ceiling and treat that string as though it were to torso for now.",

No need to build many easier robots first then. We can think of building taht single finger joint as building a single easy robot as a sub robot within the overarching robot.

I MUST be miserly on space taken up by parts to get all the crap I need to fit in there to fit in there! Anyways, I fortunately discovered that you can buy tension spring down to 1mm in OD! I was unaware of this before now! You can find it if you search &quot;0.2x1.5x1000mm tension spring&quot; where 0.2mm is wire thickness, 1.5mm is OD, 1000mm is length. So I ordered 1mm OD tension spring and 1.5mm OD tension spring to test and see what seems best. If the 1mm OD spring seems reliable to me, I&#039;ll go with it. Anyways, since the spring is now smaller, I can use also a smaller PTFE tubing to house the spring so I ordered uxcell PTFE Tubing 1.8mm ID x 2.2mm OD off amazon. 2.2mm OD tubing compared to 4mm tubing is SHOCKINGLY smaller when you look at them. So it will be WAY more space efficient now.<br><br>Here&#039;s my updated tension spring concept drawing:",

Cheap gears chattering is what gets super loud. Low downgear ratio harmonic gears or planetary gears taht are non-diyable and expensive aren&#039;t too bad I guess but most cheap hobby level gears are unacceptably loud. My goal was a cheap downgear solution with high gear ratio to open use of cheap high speed low torque motors taht you can use a ton of in a humanoid all while downgearing with very low noise output. Solving a TON of challenges in the making by this approach if it can be pulled off. And I feel I&#039;m getting extremely close to doing just that. The tradeoff is perhaps higher maintenance. But engineering tradeoffs have to come somewhere that&#039;s how engineering works. You can&#039;t have everything. You prioritize certain things and make sacrifices on some other things.

Downgearing is not in CAD and is a separate challenge. Modeling and placing all motors is the biggest space constraint problem which is why it had to be done in CAD in advance. Space efficient silent downgearing needs to be mindful of volume taken but not the the extent is needs CAD for all of it. Although I did block out most of it in CAD at least for the hand pulleys. Reproducing the pulleys will be easy once the design is finalized. Videos will walk through the whole builds. Drawings of downgearing have been coming as soon as new designs come in and not all have been tested so once they have, videos will document the construction and fill in gaps of details the drawings glossed over. Then all phases will be easily reproducible.",

But at $9 for a single spring that is 3ft long, I am feeling RIPPED OFF on price. It is bullcrap. All relating to the tariff nonsense. So I decided today to pivot and just roll with the elastic band in place of tension spring. It&#039;s a jewelry making elastic band I bought some time ago in a roll. WAY cheaper at $0.03 for 3ft instead of $9 for 3ft. That&#039;s 99.7% off! Talk about a discount! The issue I had before when I looked into this option was the tie-off point. I would need a way to tie PE fishing line to the end of the elastic band without the tie point being bulky. Well I figured out a way to do it without any bulk at all! See I want this to fit into my 1.8mm ID PTFE tubing to keep size down. My solution was to just glue the fishing line lengthwise directly to the elastic band. No knot at all. No turns at all. Just literally lay it on top and glue it down flush. I figured about 6mm length of joint would be solid. And I did this on both sides with my PE fishing line. I used 0.08mm 6lb test braided PE fishing line for this. So now I have two fishing line segments coming off the end of it for double the strength of this connection. But I only wanted one piece of fishing line to go the distance to attach to the motor end so I twisted the pair of fishing line segments together and glued the twisted pair with 401 glue then cut one of the two away leaving just one of the pair to go the distance to the winch in place pulley that this is all supposed to tension for me.",

If the elastic bands don&#039;t last, we&#039;ll upgrade to the metal springs later on during maintenance or w/e.<br><br>Note: the total length of the elastic band I am using for this is 2ft and it stretches to 3ft snugly without too much force. I&#039;m just going by feel and instinct for this measurement. If I were to go 1ft with 1ft of stretch, the stretch is more intense and the pull is harder. But I don&#039;t think I need much pull for just tensioning the winch in place pulley and I also think the more tension you place the more wear and tear on the elastic band which will shorten its lifespan. So playing it conservatively with the 2ft length selection for now.<br><br>Note: to apply the 401 glue I used an exacto knife handle with a sewing needle in place of the xacto knife blade and the tip of the sewing needle acts as my precision glue applicator.",

This way you never have ANY robot downtime needed.",

Presume Atlas/Optimus/Your robot shares the same charge ratio (no reason to think it won&#039;t; they&#039;re all using LiPo banks of some flavor).

That&#039;s the whole point of the humanoid is it does its own work and your work too. Otherwise, if it can&#039;t even swap its own batteries it is utterly worthless and useless. It also has to do its own maintenance for crying out loud so battery swaps is a trivial thing for it comparatively. <br><br>Now as far as your 7 batteries for 8 hours claim, you will need to recalculate. If battery 1 lasts 90 min and takes 2 hours to charge, then battery 2 lasts second 90 min and battery one is 30 min from full charge. So battery 3 takes us third set of 90 min and by that time battery 1 is fully charged and battery 2 is 30 min from full charge. So it can swap to battery one when battery 3 runs out. When battery 1 is empty, battery 2 has been full for past hour and battery 3 is 30 min from full. So your math was trash.",

And it isn&#039;t supposed to be a powerhouse of speed or anything its supposed to be just a middle man taking orders for modern computers and just turning on and off switches as ordered and reading in signals, not doing heavy math or logic. Those things are the job of main brains pcs, not the final low level microcontroller taking the orders. Think of it as the pawn, not the quieen or rook.",

I guess this is like arduino but stronger and more complex. Not sure if it is needed if I have a main brains onboard gaming pc doing the heavy lifting and the arduinos are just very low level pawns taking orders and mindlessly turning motors or reading in sensor data and reporting back. I don&#039;t think I have any lack of speed there. So I don&#039;t think any added complexity is necessary at this time. But ESP32 or STM32 or w/e is there if I need it I guess if things with arduino are disappointing in testing later on.",

        "com": "Minor update: I have now carefully mounted the PTFE tubing that leads to the elastic string tensioner for the winch in place pulley. I mounted it snugly to the side of the PTFE tubing coming off the same winch in place pulley that leads to the Archimedes pulley system. I routed both of these using my CAD for reference in such a way that their routing will not interfere with the next motors that will be installed later. I mounted this PTFE tubing that leads to the elastic string tensioner using ONLY 401 glue which is something I&#039;ve never tried before now. Usually I first wrap the tubing in adhesive transfer tape and spandex cloth wrap and coat the cloth in 401 glue but skipping that made it able to be more snugly mounted to the other tube by way of only glue. We&#039;ll see how that holds up without the other reinforcement the cloth provides etc. Seems to look so far so good though. They are in turn glued to paper soaked with 401 glue and to a little piece of stainless steel wire bent at a 90 and that wire in turn glued to the winch in place pulley mount baseplate which is itself made of paper and 401 glue. So basically everything is becoming 401 glue construction! I have some concerns about how this will hold up in the event of a fall or w/e but perhaps we can create some sort of protective cage around any delicate outcroppings like this in the future. For now I am just going for ease of construction and speed of construction to get things back on track and rolling again.<br><br>Note: The PTFE tubing that leads to the elastic string tensioner for the winch in place pulley is 0.66mm ID 1.16mm OD PTFE teflon tubing. The string coming off the winch in place pulley feeding into this tubing that will act as tensioner string tension carrier string is 6lb test 0.08mm PE braided fishing line. I was able to thread this fishing line into this TPFE tubing by hand with no issues at all very easily.",

That will conclude the tensioner mechanism for the winch in place pulley and this will usher in the next round of manual hand testing to see how much tension that is giving us. I also will be moving the tension spring mounted on the motor to align it better and shorten it more since it only moves like 4mm and so can be way shorter than it is now.",

I noticed I have to keep it as straight as possible since when curling with too much turning the elastic bracelet cord grips the sides of the PTFE tubing which could interfere with the amount of tension it brings to my winch in place pulley. So this will mean on the robot itself it will have to go from the shoulder all the way down the torso in a straight line and then down the leg to about the knee as well. It&#039;s 44&quot; long in total. I ended up bumping up the elastic bracelet cord to 30&quot; long to reduce the amount of tension it puts on the winch in place pulley more. The longer it is the less tension it brings and the shorter it is the more tension it brings. If it really can&#039;t fit into the leg I can cut the elastic bracelet cord in half and place braided PE fishing line in between the two halves and have that make a 180 degree turn around a pulley and thereby have the same length of elastic bracelet cord but separated into two halves mounted parallel to eachother that create a in series matching tension but taking up half the overall length. This way I could keep it out of the leg area if needed. However I think it might fit into the leg area fine perhaps. Not sure (once we get all the other motors and their tension strings that amount of 2.2mm OD PTFE tubing will start to add up.",

I was hesitant about a battery vacuum but it\u2019s quieter than my big shop vac and Dyson plus super convenient to move around. I usually throw a 5.0 battery in it and that lasts for a while on the low setting.",

What they installed was 2 plastic covers on the inside and outside on a motorized lock. The inside was a push button which would toggle the lock. The outside was an RFID thing. Ofc I had to try and it took 5 minutes:<br>Pop off the outside cover. Forget about that, not doing computers here. The through hole in the door still exists. Buttons are connected to the main unit by wiring with simple pinheader plugs.<br>You could unitonically reach for the wires going to the inside button with a wire, unplug them, pull the plug out the outside of the door, short them et voila. Once on the inside you could just put it all together again.<br>Yeah that was for indoor application but still: Do those people not think? At least add a divider plate when you have a button option.<br>Look out for attack vectors like that.",

Going to double check my math for square footage and get the roof treatment stuff and get up there at 5am Monday to get started.

Those little mobile plug-in steam cleaners absolutely pale in comparison. They are a half measure for consumers to feel good about themselves and for professionals to clean carpets in areas that hoses are not capable of reaching. The heat, the pressure, the suction, the capacity are all significantly inferior. You hardly even need chemicals to get most stains out because again, the heat, pressure and suction are so strong that most everything gets blasted right out. Plus, they dry your carpet way better than the plug-in models, so you don&#039;t gotta worry about mold. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;my dad ran a carpet cleaning business with gas fired truck mounted units</span><br>I used to do this shit to help my dad.

They somehow use the magnetism of the spinning rotor to excite the field coil. Sometimes if one has been sitting for a long time you will have to put a jumper between the field terminal and 12v to get it to start charging. Sometimes revving the engine up will do the trick. If you need to jumper it there is a little black rubber plug on the side where your standard 2 wire plug in will go to make it into a 3 wire alternator.",

An older type like the ATmega328 (arudino uno mcu) would be able to but newer types would likely see a significant rise in Vol when trying to sink 15mA. You might see 1v when you should be seeing under 100mV. The exact voltage rise would be dependent on the mcu and may or may not be acceptable depending on the characteristics of you optoisolator. Also, I would be careful putting 5v on a digital input if the mcu is unknown. Newer types would may run on 3.3v rather than 5v and there is no guarantee that the pins would be 5v tolerant. Since 19200bps is very slow by modern standards, I would buffer the output with a transistor. I imagine the LED on the optoisolator is connected to 5v through a resistor and you want to connect the cathode to the mcu pin to turn it on when the pin is low? If that is the case you can go with normal non-inverted logic and connect the tx pin on the mcu to a bjt inverter. pic related",

If you don&#039;t want this you can invert the logic on the mcu. If you can&#039;t change the mcu firmware, you can add another npn to invert the signal.

Which actually was what ended up being part of the problem: It didn&#039;t occur to me that the peripheral registers have no way of knowing whether they&#039;re being read/written by the MCU itself or by the debug...meaning that flags that are set/reset on register read are flipped &quot;at random&quot; when the debugger pauses the MCU and checks register values.<br><br>IDK, I guess I&#039;m mostly just looking for confirmation that either failing this hard is semi-normal or that I am, in fact, retarded.<br><br>Just for reference: Picrel for what ended up being the root of the problem. I couldn&#039;t figure out why the timeout for the first byte always worked fine, but the second wouldn&#039;t time out. USART_WaitForAck() would always return true (transfer received in time) even with impossibly short wait times...unless the receiving MCU was held under reset and not responding at all, at which point it would time out as expected. I eventually set the receiving MCU to just never send the second ACK and measured how long the timeout actually took, which was suspiciously close to 65535\u00b5s. Turns out, when I wrote the TimeoutSetup_uSec() routine at the core of the delay, I had implicitly assumed that the counter would be stopped at the start of that function. But, if the delay is long enough that it can be called again BEFORE the counter hits the set AutoReload (maximum/top) value, setting another, lower AutoReload value will cause the counter to dodge the original and the new timeout value won&#039;t be hit until the counter overflows.",

I&#039;ve already prototyped one deflection plate amplifier and it works fine at low frequencies. I didn&#039;t have any high voltage BJTs so I had to improvise and use IRF740s (not suitable for use in their linear region, I know) but even with those MOSFETs the deflection plate drivers are probably more than fast enough for pong. I&#039;ve built up another amp to go with the first one so I can have independent control over X and Y deflection but I haven&#039;t tested the second one yet.",

How realistic is it to buy shit off of amazon/temu and make some kind of DEW with sufficient power to kill insects in a ~5 foot range in a SINGLE pulse, I&#039;ll just use like... wood and other gun stuff I have lying around (foregrips, rails, some cheap reddot) to make the body of the thing. The supremely important thing about this is I want this to be strong enough to fry most insects (fly on the wall/curtains, house centipede on the floor etc...) at very short range WITHOUT collateral damage against wood floors, standard painted drywall, curtains, etc... common interior household surfaces<br><br>Like I know you can get some pretty strong lasers, but the whole point of this is using it inside the house and not setting shit on fire or staining them. I don&#039;t know a damn thing about lasers, I know you probably want pulse vs sustained beam or something if you can&#039;t hold the beam on target for an extended period, but as mentioned earlier, I know this isn&#039;t a get the highest power # and to guarantee the kill, it&#039;s really that sweet spot of killing the bug but not damaging whatever it was on. I have zero doubt that some rust stripping laser will kill a bug, and I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;ll fuck up whatever the bug was standing on too.<br><br>Is this viable to macgyver together with shit you can get online and at your local hardware store? or not really?<br><br>The smack it with a rolled up magazine method still works fine if this is a non-starter",

Is that really too much to ask?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pic related is what I have and they fucking suck</span>",

The easiest test is to find someone with a multimeter and measure the resistance of the bulb. If it is a low resistance (tens of ohms), the bulb is good. If it is an extremely high resistance or infinity, the bulb is bad.<br><br>If the bulb is definitely good, but not working in the socket on the machine, then it is an internal wiring problem. The problem could be as simple as cleaning out the socket with a Q-tip and some &quot;electronics part cleaner&quot; (available at any auto parts store or even walmart). It could be a broken wire somewhere, which would be worth fixing just to make sure you don&#039;t accidentally shock yourself one day because the wire touched the case. Other internal problems include a bad switch for the light or a bad solder connection somewhere.<br><br>In any case, test the bulb first. Don&#039;t be afraid to use an LED replacement bulb which would use less power and provide more light. The LED bulbs nowadays are great!<br><br>If it looks like it is an internal wiring problem, take some pictures and describe what you can see and I can try to help. It&#039;s probably the bulb though.<br><br>Hope this helps.",

To be fair, though, the 500, the next top of the line model, had the same guts as the 401. It was just in a fancier shell.

You wont be able to test it with a DMM for sure.<br><br>Anyway, If it is indeed an LED bulb, it is probably good. Next step is to check out your socket. Send a Q-tip up in there and see if you get *any* color. Any color is not a good sign, and will require cleaning. If your Q-tip comes out clean then really focus on plugging in the bulb correctly. Make sure the two stubs are hitting the plate right and make sure it is twisted in there right.

As in, you can measure it?<br><br>The part you&#039;re looking for is called something like &quot;sewing machine friction drive motor pulley&quot;. Almost certainly it is not press-fit, but there is a set screw to hold it onto the shaft. Maybe you can find a tapered one, if not just get a round/cylinder one where the outside diameter is slightly oversize to the one on your machine.<br><br>To modify the round pulley: put the pulley on a rod, then chuck that rod into a drill w/ the metal sleeve/extension away from the chuck. Kind of &#039;backwards&#039;, compared to how it will be installed on the machine. That&#039;s so you won&#039;t have to hold the thing at a weirdo angle.<br><br>Then put a file in a vise, or use an f-clamp to hold one flat on a table. A single cut file (less prone to clogging vs anything else, sandpaper, etc). Then slowly grind rubber away. Hold it up to the handwheel, check fit, etc repeat, etc.<br><br>After you get one that works right, a reminder: if you&#039;re not using the machine for a period, don&#039;t leave the rubber in contact with the hand wheel, or you will get a little dimple/flat spot. On some machines that means loosening the motor mounts, on some it means loosening up the pulley and backing it off just a bit.",

They make e-spinners now if you don&#039;t want to deal with learning how to treadle, which can be kind of a pain. For cotton the usual methods are charka or tahkli, but an e-spinner should work if you jam the ratio up high enough. You might be able to DIY an e-spinner, but I have no idea how. DIY-ing a spindle is easy, but for cotton you want a small, quickly-rotating one that&#039;s supported, not suspended. Look up tahklis and try to imitate that. <br><br>For cotton specifically you want high speed. Cotton likes being spun thin, but it&#039;s still going to take time to get a strong, consistent thread. Here&#039;s some resources for how to spin cotton (most are for spindles or wheels, sorry):<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq5<wbr>cAiheSpc<br>https://www.motherearthgardener.com<wbr>/diy/spin-homegrown-cotton-zm0z19wz<wbr>but/<br>https://schachtspindle.com/blogs/ar<wbr>chives/how-to-spin-cotton-on-a-spin<wbr>ning-wheel<br><br>If you want doll hair, it might be easier to get some washed longwool sheep locks. The specific breeds would be like Wensleydale, Leicester Longwool, or Teeswater. They&#039;re all rare breeds in the UK, but Wensleydale is not considered rare in the US. Check Etsy, or look on the Rare Breeds Trust (UK) or Livestock Conservancy (US). Other countries, not sure where to go. Blue Faced Leicester might work and they&#039;re pretty common, but that would be a doll with really curly hair.",

Get some sewing pins and put it down on the board. Then use it to cut it all out. That&#039;s how I make them. I ended up with around 20+ big patterns for my work.",

Mark Placement<br>Have the sleeve on or a dress form (if possible).<br><br>Use chalk or pins to mark where the clasp halves meet exactly\u2014you want no pulling or sagging when closed.<br><br>2. Prep the Thread<br>Use a double-threaded needle for strength.<br><br>Tie a knot at the end.<br><br>3. Position the Clasp<br>Start with one side (usually the loop or eye).<br><br>Hold or pin in place.<br><br>for Bulky fabric or clasp has loops (IE D-rings/frog closures), tack down w/few hidden anchor stitches before starting ladder stitch.<br><br>4. Using Ladder Stitch<br>This is key for invisible joins between fabric and clasp base:<br><br>Come up from inside the fold or seam (hide that knot!).<br><br>Insert needle straight across into the opposite side (either clasp fabric loop or garment), moving forward slightly.<br><br>Go back and forth across the gap, alternating sides, keeping stitches parallel like rungs of a ladder.<br><br>Pull the thread snug every 2\u20133 stitches to &quot;zip&quot; the seam shut.<br><br>Continue around the clasp until it feels solid and secure.<br><br>5. Secure the Thread<br>Tie a knot discreetly under the clasp or in a seam.<br><br>Optional: add a dab of clear nail polish or fabric glue to the knot to keep it from slipping (especially for stress points).<br><br>6. Repeat for the Other Side<br>Make sure the other half of the clasp aligns perfectly before sewing it down. Otherwise, your sleeve\u2019ll be twisted, and nobody wants that.<br><br> Extra Tips:<br>If it\u2019s a metal clasp with holes, you can ladder-stitch through the holes or use a whipstitch if more secure.<br><br>For delicate or thin fabric, reinforce the clasp area with fusible interfacing or a small fabric patch on the inside so the thread doesn\u2019t tear through.<br><br>If your clasp has a fabric tab, ladder stitch it into the seam or the hem for the cleanest look.",

Sewing, like any craft is an art. <br><br>I saw some dresses at the mall yesterday and I told my sister that that is something I&#039;d love to make someday. I like the complexity and the craft, how I can make it amazing. You can too. Just study up on it.",

This implies the actuating rod is bent and thus shortened as it never fully disengages, also the cam follower is currently seized to the shaft (everything on this machine was seized).

Your posts read like schizophrenic rambling and the actual content is not much above that, only that densifying concrete is actually a thing that is done, but it&#039;s usually done for structural reasons. <br>You can use fly ash to replace some cement in the mix and that, unlike silica, is financially viable, but you&#039;re still not getting much out of it.

Going from 8cm to 20cm halves your wall heat loss. But the wall heat loss is only 20-30% of your total heat loss, so you&#039;re still only saving maybe 15% on heating overall, going from 8cm to 20cm wall insulation. Or let&#039;s be generous and say it&#039;s 20%. Is that 20% difference the critical, decision-making point that enables you to completely drop central heating? No it&#039;s not. You&#039;re either okay with heating with split ACs and electrical underfloor, or you&#039;re not. You can do it just as well with 8cm EWI as with 20cm EWI. Heating with split AC and direct electric is entirely viable in any kind of insulated building, but you&#039;re always sacrificing some level of comfort or running costs or both for avoiding the investment into central heating, regardless of whether your heat loss is 30W/sqm or 25W/sqm.",

Now from what I know, theoretically you can safely span a beam 1.5x in feet of it&#039;s depth in inches but in practice it&#039;s hard to span a beam more than it&#039;s depth if it&#039;s also expected to carry the weight of joists, ie 12 feet for a 12 inch deep beam carrying the weight of floor joists, but they are spanning what looks to be 12 inch deep beams 2-2.5x the distance in feet without any real sagging despite the fact they&#039;re supposed to sag just from being forced to support their own weight at that point if you force them to go that far.<br><br>The only solution I could think of was that they are cantilevering the beams a bit on both sides of the room at the ends while also putting a very heavy weight on top of the cantilevers to keep the beam from bending. That&#039;s an answer rooted in basic physics at least, but if that&#039;s the case, why isn&#039;t it talked about more? I can&#039;t find anything about this on the internet so I thought I&#039;d ask here.<br><br>OP Picrel is an amazing example of what I&#039;m asking - there&#039;s no way modern civil engineers would sign off on those big beams spanning even half the distance they are on the pic, it&#039;s overkill to a comical degree. You&#039;d absolutely expect them to sag just from their own weight at that point, but no. So what gives? How the baguette gang do it?",

This is because the beams are propped up over the wall beneath them, but the wall above them sits at the end of the beam, so the edges are pushed downward with the full weight of the floors and roof above and the middle of the floor is strengthened.<br>A stone building would either be narrower than the wood ones or their would be a wall(s) down the middle acting as a support.",

Anyway, I was miserably broke and without any free time at the time, he proposed me to help out and get free courses, almost laughed at his face, I could be fun, but I would have to live in the subway. I just politely refused. Anyway, nyc sux, but if you are close to there I can try to find him for you, there was a hack lab in Manhatan, that people used to do stuff with cloths, but they were also struggling to survive and make ends meet. USA is fucked, here back home there are free State hack labs where you can just go and use the tools and have courses, late capitalism just doesn&#039;t work.",

It was poor quality 720p with no autofocus at fixed 30fps upscaled potentially to 5k, or saved as 120fps, but still 30fps. I have no idea why they&#039;d make everything good and then fuck the camera, the one part that actually matters. I had free returns on it, and returned it. At one point I&#039;d bought an ultra mini action/borehole cam literally for $2, and that thing had almost comparable video quality to the cheapo &quot;5k&quot; camera.",

There was an electrical box and previous resident at this condo wanted a fan in a different location, and new owner lady wanted to put a second smaller fan where the box was. So I had to drill a hole in the side of that small fan, run the wires from the big fan through the side, and then tie together 3x live wires, 3x neutrals, and 3x grounds while holding the fan up and not losing the short wire coming from the second fan. And then had to jam all of those wires into the small fan\u2019s body with the remote receiver and all that bullshit. Soldering up there would\u2019ve been a big headache and wire nuts aren\u2019t as secure or easy.<br><br>Also I did a little over the sink like 30\u201d LED kitchen light for a lady a few months back, bought the light from Home Depot, and that thing actually came with Wagos instead of wire nuts.

So hard to get wrong even when you cheal out hard you still can&#039;t really get it wrong.<br>The &#039;2000W&#039; rating and the cigarette lighter plug shown are ridicolous. Assuming ideal efficiency you&#039;d be looking at 166 Amps drawn through that. I guess they dont even make a regular size blade fuse for that kind of current. My feeling is the 2kW rating is real and it will just blow the fuse and if unfused melt and burn this accessory.",

You had to admit you have no idea what to do it yourself and go back to the basics.<br>Engineering is not about having money, but an organized plan for the material and principles at play. Even non-functioning off-scale models and drawings of fantastic nature and shitty proportion creates understanding, raises more questions for the next iteration and is the beginning part of any plan. In fact if those are not done, it would not be engineering but money fraud because risk is not assessed and potential is over blown. It will be a pure waste of material, labor and capital.<br>Project your mental image into the physical world if you love it so much. Melt wax, shave wood, fold paper, drill pipe, bind sand, hotglue boxes, do whatever it takes to express the idea. Doing things yourself cuts down on complexity as stuff you see on media but not made available to you is simply ignored and starts looking on what you can have.<br>Start organizing your thoughts. No one else can. Try writing on different kind of paper and bind them. Paper clip with cardstock and 3 hole punched paper with binder are my favorites.",

They should wear non removable electronic tracking devices with a non-stop publicity available data stream providing telemetry, audio and video for public viewing and judgement. They are there to serve the public. This measure is a simple way to keep track of our tax dollars and will save millions of lives and trillions of dollars. If a citizen monitors a public servant acting inappropriately, a negative feedback device (electric shock) should be incorporated in the device to sway the servant back to the correct path.",

That window was definitely added after the fact by someone who doesn&#039;t know what they are doing or just couldn&#039;t be bothered to take the siding/plaster out all the way so they didn&#039;t reframe it. It is cooked, but I see stuff like this all the time in old houses that I remodel so your house isn&#039;t going to fall down if you don&#039;t fix it but you&#039;re already down to the studs so there&#039;s no reason not to reframe it properly. <br><br>Pic related shows a few different ways to frame a window but the third picture on the right is objectively the best way and that&#039;s the way I always do it. Note the cripple studs at the bottom of the window on either side of the sill that are supporting it. The second way, same way as this picture <a href=\"#p2931783\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2931783</a> is fine in most cases but it certainly doesn&#039;t hurt to add the studs on either side of the sill to support the window entirely.<br><br>It looks like in your house there is no header and someone just put blocks between the studs. Headers are usually cut out of a 4x6 beam. You can also use two 2x6s nailed together with an appropriately sized piece of plywood tacked on to bring it out to be the same width as everything else. I&#039;m sure your friends will be able to help out with all this stuff though.<br><br>At the end of the day it will cost maybe $40 in material and a couple of hours in time to do it right and then you&#039;ll never have to worry about it, just do it anon and have fun.",

The time moving the hydraulic wrench around is typically not worth the precision/high torque capability for 95% of bolts found on most equipment/tractors. With an air impact you just need an air line to the compressor. With hydraulic you need two lines (feed/return), a pump, a electric motor/or engine to drive the pump etc. And if the one of the hoses blow out for some reason you need specialty hoses/fittings/crimping tools to repair them. If your air line leaks it&#039;s usually alright to get the job done. Plus it&#039;s cheaper to repair or replace.",

Heat accelerates wear. Lack of lubrication accelerates wear. Air motors don&#039;t generate heat (in specific cases, they can need heat sinks because they get too _cold_), and air-powered tools often have lubricant added regularly or even constantly.<br><br>Electric motors generate heat. While the tools themselves aren&#039;t inherently more difficult to lubricate, it&#039;s easier to ignore that facet of their maintenance than with air tools, it seems. Electric motors also require insulating parts, which are almost always some kind of polymer or ceramic. Polymers often have problems with brittlenes and degradation when exposed to heat and petroleum products. Until very recently, electric motors had to be huge to even come close to matching air motors, and that gap has merely shrunk, not disappeared. All of this adds up to electric tools being heavier and less reliable, and almost always more expensive up front in an apples-to-apples performance comparison.<br><br>Additionally, a huge portion of industrial settings already require compressed air for other processes or machines. It sort of just makes sense to use pneumatic tools if you already have an extensive air system. The ONLY real downsides are that they can&#039;t be cordless (not usually a huge issue in industry) and running cost (which IS a huge deal in industry). And those running costs, while potentially significant, are trivial when considered as a portion of overall operating expenses. The reliability, repairability, and lower initial investment for pneumatics generally sees them favored, in the end. While high-performance electric motors have cut into this edge somewhat, it&#039;s unlikely any industry will abandon pneumatic tools entirely any time soon.",

Then of course because internet losers without any real intention of building one and no reasonable way to live in one, they got hyped up to $100k RV&#039;s disguised as a house. They should be well built, well thought out, practical, but most of all, sensible. No you don&#039;t need a copper roof and cedar siding on your trailer. Oak floors shouldn&#039;t be in a compact apartment. $100,000 sheds with plumbing make no sense every way you look at it. <br><br>Then theres a problem of where do you even put the fuckin thing? You cannot just find an empty field, tow your shack there and live in it. You generally need water, sewage, and electricity. Great, how many empty 1/8th acre plots are available? There just fuckin are none. <br><br>There is no &quot;most practical&quot; because thats different for each climate, the inhabitants, and the location its in or will likely be in. Then on top of that it has to be on wheels even if you have no intention of ever moving it again. But if thats your definite plan, why bother building a tinyhome at all? Just built a small apartment on a slab.",

If you brought a ratty 200k range house in an up and coming town and waited 5-10 years it will probably 2-3x, you can see that across a number of cities. However if you say owned 40 acres of land near a city undergoing a large boom and development, one could parcel the lots and sell them at the individual market price or get brought out by a big developer. So putting a camp on some acreage to recover some cost of it while betting on the areas long term development isn&#039;t some starry eyed bullshit.",

Some where between pipe fitter and mill wright. Sometimes when the guy that I normally work with is out they&#039;ll either send me a helper from another site or find me an intern hiding in one of the offices and some of these dorks feel the need to bring their survival role-play onto the jobsite.<br><br>Needed to repack a couple gate valves. I grabbed a wrench, a flat screwdriver, a pick, the roll of packing and a knife. The guy they sent me said he knows all about valves so ok have at fucker. It&#039;s not like this is some complex highly guarded witchcraft. So I have all the tools he needed and instead he reaches in his pocket, pulls out his wallet, opens it and pulls put this card monstrosity with slots on it and puts it on the valve. It&#039;s some kind of multi wrench bullshit and he tries to use it to take the nuts off. That shit was too good. I repacked the other valve while he struggled with it. They were studs too, not eye bolts/rod ends like you might see on larger valves so once he managed to squeeze that piece of shit in there the whole stud started spinning on him. That&#039;s when I had to step in, because he pulled one of those multi tool needle nose pliers and was going to use that to hold the back nut and I wasn&#039;t going to let him leave teeth marks on my valve.<br><br>Another one used one of those to cut all the metal banding off some pallets. There&#039;s like 3 or 4 different sets of bull dogs on the bench in the bay where the warehouse guys drop our pallets. Then the fucking guy lifts his multi took up next to his face, smiles at me and shakes it like he&#039;s in some fucking commercial. 1st time in my life I actually wanted to commit a hate crime against someone for being a homosexual.<br><br>I&#039;ve had to stop people from using them at least a dozen times. The only thing that isn&#039;t shit is the knife, you can get a regular knife that&#039;s easier to open and hold.",

It&#039;s noticeably higher quality than modern Leatherman stuff, all the tools open from the outside, has a good locking mechanism, and some of the individual tools in it are very well designed and useful. (Like the sharp scraper thing, the large flathead that makes a way better prybar than LM ones, better Phillips, scissors, etc.) It&#039;s also very slim compared to LMs with similar tools. The only real downsides are that it doesn&#039;t have one-handed opening and that the knife blade is kinda shit but I always have a regular folding knife in my pocket and the multitool is a supplement that I only carry sometimes when I think I might need it. (I keep one in my motorcycle tank bag, one in my truck center console, one in my backpack when I&#039;ve got that, one in my work tool belt, etc.)",

If you don&#039;t have a use for a multitool then of course there&#039;s no reason to carry one; continue not doing so.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cutting fruit</span><br>Agreed. Would not use a &quot;tool&quot; tool for any kind of food prep with all the weird bullshit they get exposed to but then I also don&#039;t tend to slice or peel fruits either. Maybe split the rind of an orange or something but still would overwhelmingly just wait until I was in a suitable environment like a kitchen (or prepare it in the kitchen in advance) rather than goop up a folder.",

Long been sold out/discontinued. I have pretty good luck with cheap knives. First thing I do is disassemble them and loctite all the screws and re-tighten them down good. Here&#039;s something similar on there that I would consider buying. Look for a folding cleaver pocket knife as your search terms and you should be able to find something similar on temu or ebay. <br><br>Holster is a pretty generic leather holster for a M&amp;P shield off e-bay. Holsterworld I think is who I bought that one from. I wet formed some leather around my gerber tool and stitched the sheath for it onto the holster myself. <br><br>That is an &quot;armored case&quot; for an aluminum barreled sharpie that I turned out of some hex stock. I would absolutely destroy the barrel on those sharpies doing my daily tasks, and I love having a sharpie on me at all times. The plastic barreled ones actually fared better in my pocket, but I&#039;d crack the housings on them after a while too. I just put a drop or two of super glue on a sharpie and slip it in the housing. If it dries up I can unscrew the top part and put another marker head on that barrel, or if the threads of the aluminum barrel get fucked up I can heat the whole thing with a small torch and push the entire thing out using a punch through an extraction hole at the end.

A clumping one is manageable, but with a small garden, don&#039;t think that it will just do what you want. You have to make it do what you want by root barriers and you can even dig up a root and plant it on up your garden fence if it isn&#039;t spreading over there in a few years. It will spread into your neighbours garden if you put it by the fence if there is no underground barrier. Bambusa Oldhamii specifically will spread around 10-15 feet in any direction. It is a good idea to grow IF you give it a clear barrier to grow within. Btw you can eat the shoots of that variety<br><br>I love bamboo. I know all this shit because I have been obsessed with it since I was a child. It&#039;s a really cool plant. But you got to know how much space it can take if you have a small garden and prepare in accordance. If you put a good barrier under the fence, I say do it. You can also put a barrier in what ever shape you like on your side of the garden for it to grow in. It is just nice to let it grow",

And maybe drill some holes at the bottom if you want drainage. If there&#039;s no holes, come a storm or heavy rain it will bog. Bamboo shouldn&#039;t mind getting waterlogged, but you just might not want that. It shouldn&#039;t matter too much. I&#039;d say that putting some wood to rot down is a good idea too. And any weeds you get from the garden you can kill them in the sun and then throw em on for mulch and extra nutrients. It&#039;s a solid plan",

Anyways, the wheat is ready to harvest, and I SEVERELY underestimated my crop yield. I was figuring I&#039;d get like 20 pounds of wheat kernels maximum, but boy was I wrong... I&#039;ve got like 2 bushels of wheat I have to harvest before the crops go bad and I&#039;m running on borrowed time here. I checked some local ag equipment rental stores and family farms, and the only things they have are full-sized combines and tractors, which cost upwards of $1K a day to rent out. Moreover, I have no clue how to use a combine. How the hell do I harvest all this by hand and what tools do I need to buy to make this happen?",

Because of that i have been thinking about a gaming laptop but due to previous bad experiences with laptops and the other disadvantages with them im not very keen on that idea. Other option would be to build a &quot;hybrid&quot; desktop/laptop as in building a mini itx pc that i would place in a briefcase along with 2 folding hinged screens and keyboard/mouse readily available. It would still be easy to transport and would only take 1-2 minutes to pack up while still having the power/longetivity of a desktop. <br>Has anyone done something like this?<br>(My english is not very good and it certainly shows)",

Top balance them on 24V in parallel at the start, then check them here and there if they are mostly the same voltage. Even if there is some capacity difference from the factory, it shouldn&#039;t drift significantly. And then if it does, you can worry about it then. <br>Chinks have these https://www.aliexpress.com/item/100<wbr>5008869277316.html balancer units, but if you end up with this, make sure to fuse it and don&#039;t put it near anything flammable. <br> <br>Conversely, a good 16s high current BMS is at least $100, closer to $200; if you&#039;re gonna spend that much on balancing alone, you might as well just build the whole battery from scratch, probably end up with something better than C-grade Aliexpress packs.",

The batteries themselves are to be placed in a non-flammable environment though there&#039;s to be a long line of breakers about 1 meter directly above them. <br>The reviews on these chiesiums are surprisingly decent, apparently some folks have been running them for years with little to complain about; I&#039;ve been planning on getting another pair to bring the system to 200Ah if these two (+ the inverter) prove to work well. A $100-200 BMS is justified in my eyes in this case. <br>The problem with BMS&#039;es in general from a newcomer&#039;s perspective is that most of the time they&#039;re either already installed inside a commercial battery or are more of a DIY solution wherein they&#039;re wired to individual 3V cells. Just surprised there&#039;s so few examples of something in-between i.e. this particular case with 2 commercial batteries in series. I&#039;d assumed these can just be treated as 2 basic cells, i.e. internal BMS take care of the 3V cells and the external one balances the two sums.<br><br>Guess we&#039;ll see how it goes, maybe I&#039;ll follow your other advice and just make somethng custom out of cells and a proper BMS. For now the immediate concern was that the system would immediately go up in toxic smoke due to no balancing between the two 24Vs.",

If you don&#039;t harden it, it shouldn&#039;t shatter, but annealed D2/3 is relatively soft, just stupid fucking tough so it might bend from all the impacts. You&#039;ll want the blades at least 50 Rockwell C hard regardless of alloy, or they&#039;ll wear out crazy fast. Hitting specific hardnesses without special equipment can be difficult though. I wouldn&#039;t worry about shattering that much however, the hardest thing you&#039;ll probably hit in what I&#039;m assuming is raw timber/tree trimmings would be nails, which any of these steels should go right through, or stall the motor out. It&#039;ll mess up the blade but as long as you&#039;re not chucking rocks in the thing and are wearing proper PPE, you should be fine.<br>A2 is 1.2363<br>O1 is 1.2510",

Also for OP&#039;s use case it&#039;ll be fine hes gonna end up soldering anyways. But a few pointers:<br>Soldering before crimping is moronic because crimping exists to replace soldering and avoid it&#039;s drawbacks. A Crimped connection on a tinned wire wont be as good long term as on bare wire.<br>It&#039;s the same as not twisting wire before crimping. Keep it neat. But dont twist it. Twisting it i creases it&#039;s cross section. No problem if it was really crimped properly following that, which leads to cold welding of the strands and connector, but that is rare outside la factoria. So if crimped relatively weak one could later twist the connector so that it undoes the twist in the wire, after which they slide right out.<br>Best is to just get connectors meant to be soldered, like with a soldering cup or flag and use that.<br>Also don&#039;t get lead free solder if you&#039;re doing things for yourself. It sucks.",

A larger bore on the ram gets you more area (thus more force) for the hydraulic fluid to act on, or, conversely, using a higher pressure in the hydraulic system gets you more pressure acting on the same area (thus more force).<br><br>The latter is easier (when possible), but you can&#039;t just go increasing pressure arbitrarily. The hoses, fittings, seals, and ram were only designed for a specific maximum. Unless you can find actual part numbers to look up or pressure ratings stamped on the cylinder, it&#039;s probably a safe bet to assume the pump is already set to work near or at the rating of the ram. If, by some fluke, the ram is rated for more than it&#039;s currently operating at, great, you can replace anything that isn&#039;t rated for the higher pressure you want and just do that. If not, do not risk it. Hydraulic fluid under several thousand PSI of pressure is no joke, and not something to fuck around with. Go look up &quot;fluid injection injury&quot;. It&#039;s not pretty, and flailing around blindly, not knowing what you&#039;re doing, is not a good way to avoid it.<br><br>Odds are good you&#039;re going to be stuck just getting a bigger ram. There&#039;s no real way to cheat the basic physics here, so either hit up some surplus sites and get the welder out or trade out for an entirely different splitter. Mind, also, that the existing frame might not fare well with a more powerful ram, so...<br><br><a href=\"#p2928486\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2928486</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bigger pump + bigger engine = more pressure I believe</span><br><br>Why do namefags insist on posting when they outright admit they don&#039;t know what they&#039;re talking about?

The rest of them pretty much suck. The super cheap ones, the plastic cracks on the sprayer part right at the neck of the bottle. And even the better built ones stop spraying well, but some silicone lube can salvage them sometimes.<br><br>For stuff I actually use quite a bit, I go with the pump ones. Home Depot has the HDX ones, the handheld is just under 1/2gal and I think only costs like $2 more than the decent Zep 32oz sprayers. And then there\u2019s 1gal and 2gal models with the wands for like $15. Those pump sprayers by far have the best spray-stream control too, any of the 32oz basic sprayers will tire your hand out quick if you\u2019re trying to spray a fine mist for more than a couple pumps.<br><br>I had one of the 56oz HDX fail sort of prematurely, and I think it was from leaving a corrosive cleaner in there for a couple months that beat up the chrome plated pump rod, that\u2019s it.",

I&#039;m going to attempt to fix itI confirmed it&#039;s the cable itself (right channel) when testing each IEM because swapping them didn&#039;t change the result, and pressing on the solder joints to the terminals could momentarily restore sound if held in just right. This is a manufacturer defect which I already received a refund for before, but it irritates me, so I want to give it a go.<br><br>I took pictures. Here is one image of the cable with the metal jacket slid downwards. Quite the ugly job; just blobs of solder, and hot glue to stabilize. From what I could see, one channel uses the outer copper strands (as a ground?), and the other uses the separate line for the right channel audio. I thought it&#039;d be two cables for each rather than this configuration, but it seems not. I&#039;ll post another pic after this.",

Last owner provided a stack of receipts, and the car had a bunch of AC diag work done not long before I purchased it. Eventually it started blowing warm, so I brought it to a mechanic twice. Couldn&#039;t find any leaks, but replaced the shaft seal on the compressor. Now it&#039;s starting to blow warm again. If two real mechanics couldn&#039;t diagnose the leak, then I have no chance.<br><br>What I&#039;m thinking about doing is purchasing picrel and replacing the refrigerant with propane. I&#039;ll top it off a couple of times a year. Should be cheaper than R-134a, and blow way colder. Apparently the fire risk is overstated since it&#039;s such a small amount of propane, and it&#039;s a gas that burns off pretty safely.",

Wire a 3 prong cord to the dishwasher so you can plug it into an outlet. The hard part is that dishwashers are typically designed to physically mount to the underside of a counter top, this prevents it from tipping over when you try to open the door. You can try to attach something to the back to weigh it down though. It&#039;s going to look janky, unless you build a cabinet for it specifically. You&#039;re not going to be able to add it to your existing cabinets without some non-temporary demo work.<br><br>Or you can just buy a camper/RV style dish washer that just sits on your counter top.

        "com": "I was ripped off by a car dealership so to get even I am going to damage cars until I feel I&#039;ve caused an equivalent value to what I was ripped off plus cost of performing my plan. Here is my plan:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;First wait a few months so they&#039;ve forgotten about me</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Build a large, portable slingshot sturdy enough to launch a handful of 1&quot; ball bearings about 50 yards</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Print fake temporary license plate, get a rental car, get a remote controlled magnet to hold fake license plate in place.</span><br>The car dealership is conveniently located directly next to a freeway on ramp. The idea is to get a rental car, hide the real license plate with a fake one held on by a magnet that I can remotely switch on/off in case I need to ditch it fast (freeway cameras will capture my plate number otherwise). I will make the large slingshot operable by me while driving, load it up with the ball bearings, and as I&#039;m driving up the freeway on ramp at night I will launch the bearings out. They will spread out and have enough mass/height to break windows, make dents. It won&#039;t be anything huge but damage like this on brand new cars will add up. Of course they will have insurance and ability to fix things cheaply so I will assume ~$1,000 of damage each time if I launch 10 ball bearings. I will need to repeat this 6 times to reach equivalent exchange.<br><br>The slingshot I&#039;m planning to build will be something like picrel but smaller. Portable so I can move it in/out of the rental car backseat. Built in a way that I can load it up before driving and then lower the window and launch it by reaching back while driving. I will use gloves while handling the ball bearings, otherwise they&#039;ll be completely full of finger prints.<br><br>I have the tools, time, and mental issues to build something like this pretty easily. Do you think this plan is realistic and repeatable 6 times without getting caught? Any suggestions for improvement or anything I didn&#039;t consider?",

I can&#039;t comment on how viable the wires chosen are for their assignments.

I&#039;ve seen tutorials for bare concrete, terrazzo, smoother concrete, etc. but I would like to know if there is a way to make concrete look like travertine. I assume it&#039;ll be mixing white cement and sand, separate in batches and color each in different shades and pour them in sequence and carefully not to disturb the layers, maybe pouring on top of a spatula on top of the mold instead of directly over. Are there any options I should look into? or can I start with just this general information? I haven&#039;t designed the piece yet, but it would be 80cm wide, around 40cm deep, and between 10-30cm thick depending on the design of the basin. <br><br>Maybe I could add salt on the exterior to create the porous look of real travetine, but the part that touches water should be smooth, maybe I could fill the gaps with golden resin to go full luxury, but that would be another area I would have no experience in. I&#039;ve seen videos of professionally made ones and I can see some reinforcement in the cement, I think it&#039;s glass fiber. <br><br><a href=\"#p2932368\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2932368</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;4 types of windows</span><br>I would tackle that when possible<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Paintings pointing upwards </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tiny chandelier on a long-ass chain hanging on top of nothing</span><br>Maybe move the dining area under that, if possible get a chandelier that justifies that much length <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Empty walls but a cluttered mess just under eye level </span><br><br>You also need more sources of light<br>You can keep the walls bare, but one tall decorative feature will help a lot",

Figure a 3 inch hole saw would be fine for a beer and say the strips were 1/2&quot;x 1&quot; you could evenly space them for 3 &gt;3/8&quot; gaps which will allow for drainage and be solid enough to hold a wine glass or whatever. Only problem is that doesn&#039;t give a lot of protection for your drink to keep it from being knocked over. Next thought is a 4&quot; hole saw through a 1x and use the core for a base of sorts. I&#039;ll center it on the bottom of the 3&quot; hole, clamp it in place, and drill probably 5 1/4&quot; holes through it evenly at the edges. Draw a star to help line then up. Only drill ~1&quot; into the arm. Then cut 5 pieces of 1/4&quot; wooden dowel. A beer can is about 4 1/2 inches. You&#039;ll want to be able to grab the top to get it out so let&#039;s go for 3.75 inches of can coverage. Assuming the arm boards are 1.5&quot; like a typical 2x we&#039;ll need 2.25 inches between the bottom of the arm and the top of 1x circle. We drilled an inch into the arm board so we&#039;ll add an inch, and the 1x is 0.75 so we&#039;ll also add that. Cut the dowels to about 4 inches. Glue and line everything up, sound the dowels flat on the bottom and sand a roundover on the hole. Congrats, you got a little sexy suspended beer cage. You can then wrap the whole thing with fabric for better insulation. That&#039;s what I&#039;d do at least, wouldn&#039;t need to buy anything extra.because I have all that stuff on hand.",

Will let them finish out the winter on some field pasture and then probably cut them down to around 30 or so... Have 5 more bigger calves that will get pulled off cows before I kick them out this spring and around 40 babies on the ground right now.",

I scattered all the big pile around from the other thread and there was a period where no new loads came in. Probably have 5-6 loads there again now... Will have to scatter more soon. Had some more wet and sloppy weather here lately and those pens are so much better with the woodchips. 100% would recommend. <br><br>Going to haul those calves down to the sale barn today. They will sell tomorrow. 32 calves (mostly steers and like 5 heifers) and one old bull going to the sale. Have a new breeding bull coming in probably next week or the week after whenever they schedule delivery. Have 7 bulls total and just rotate out one or two every year usually. Sometimes you turn them out and never see them again. River bottom pasture is kinda rough and they can just disappear on you from time to time. <br><br>Last weeks market report looked good, hopefully my calves do good for me this week. I will still have another 15 head or so to sell late spring as well for a little more operating money through the summer.",

Some buy to slaughter, some buy to expand their own herd, some people with good land and money will try to pick out load of skinny steer and spend a season fattening them up to flip them. It&#039;s a real open market.</span><br>Same here. There are a couple sale barns nearby that we could take them to. Anyone can go in there and register and buy cattle if they want to. I&#039;ve heard the drought in different areas has cattle herd numbers down, and replacement heifer numbers are way down as well because people have been selling them rather than keeping them the past several years... I&#039;ve been keeping back some heifers every year for 5 years now, ever since my dad passed away and I took over managing the herd. First 3 years about 20-25 head. Last year 30 head, and I have 41 so far this year. Might sort off a few head and send them to the sale, might just keep them and supplement some pasture with feed. I have a surplus of hay, and hay isn&#039;t worth shit right now.",

They won&#039;t smell as bad, which will probably be some relief for you until you can get them outside. If they&#039;re not on a medicated feed then you should ferment their feed for a few days with the charcoal and some Greek yogurt to help their gut flora. Apple cider vinegar shaken with the mother can help their gut flora too. Usually they get their gut flora from eating their mother&#039;s poop so the fermented food will help a lot. If they are still on a medicated feed then you can get some adult feed to ferment and offer it to them once or twice a day.",

I swear some of these places selling bulls have a plethora of info to look through. <br><br>If we like the looks of a bull and their attitude, then we will dig into the rest of the specs and see if they will be a good match for the herd. Or sometimes visa-versa, look through the specs first, and then find matches and then look at the bull. If they look good and have a nice frame with a big butt then they&#039;ll go on the list as a possible buy. My herd doesn&#039;t have any issues with milk production by any means, so that is one stat that we kinda gloss over and don&#039;t select for much. <br><br>We do run mostly angus bulls, but my wife actually purchased a Saler/angus cross bull (Optimizer) just this week. We&#039;ll give him a try and see if we like him. If not, he cost us $3600, and we could almost make our money back across the scales at the local salebarn. <br><br>And of course price is another thing. I&#039;m not going to spend $10,000 or more for a bull that I can turn out on the river bottom and never see again, or have an injury that will put him out for the rest of his life. I don&#039;t care how good he is. I&#039;d rather have 2-3 bulls that aren&#039;t 100% optimal, but will make sure to get the job done and still throw good calves. It&#039;s all a balancing act.",

Sometimes sooner if we just don&#039;t like them as much as we hoped to. Once in a while we will turn one out and never see them again, or we will get a shoulder or leg injury. The newest smallest bulls get put with the newest heifers and 1st and 2nd year cows and kept with them until we take them to the river with the older cows. This gives them a couple years to grow and learn the ropes as it is pretty rough terrain down there.",

It&#039;s way less common when the goal is more cow in calf i.e for dairy farms. You go sticking a 500 dollar embryo into your dairy cow for what? Their herd genetics usually already pretty good. And you actually only get like a 50% in calf rate from it. Semen is the king for those guys who are looking to milk cows and just have calves and produce. What we would do is use other random cows as surrogates. I would graze these cows and when someone bought an embyro they would buy it and buy the cow as well, and take them both home near to calving knowing 100% that it was in calf and whether it was a bull or a heiffer in there. It could be a completely different breed to the cow carrying it.<br><br>Embyos are where a lot of the fancy bulls who are producing the semen come from. Some of the calves might be worth several thousand dollars the instant they are born. And the cows that are flushed for eggs to make more embryos.<br><br>I would sync the cows up and have guys from the lab come to transfer them. On the surface it looks a lot like AI but it takes a little longer. They actually feel which side the cow has ovulated from and try to place the embryo at the end of that fallopian tube instead of just dribbling semen in there. The guy could do 150 or so in a day. Times that by the rate each? Those guys were vets not just techs for embryo. Big difference for cow management is the timing, you record who is on heat, and then the implanting takes place the following week not right away. I would place CIDR back into the cows before scanning and after they were scanned the ones that were empty were ripe to come around again for another try.<br><br>Being a tech is decent money you are right, they get paid for each cow. So they get busy and make bank while the season is on. <br><br>I&#039;m actually thinking of doing it I&#039;m interested in this stuff.

There was no other way to adjust it. A few days ago with too much force applied to the valve it simply came apart. <br><br>The screwdriver is holding up the arm of the float device as it&#039;s the only way I could get it to shut off. There is no isolation valve anywhere - I tried to see if I could twist that indent you see with a screwdriver and could maybe shut it off that way but it&#039;s not possible. And yes it has to be that high and in that position despite how the floating device never went remotely that high. It actually took about 20 minutes for me to get it in that position to stop the valve. There is no way to turn off the valve otherwise except to go out in the road and turn it off there which turns off the water for not only the whole house but the farm also - old houses man. I&#039;ve purchased isolation valves though I really don&#039;t know where they would go. <br> <br>That nut there - should that go clockwise from this perspective side open it and take it off? That&#039;s how the analogous nut on my new device would go. Maybe I could try to hold the nut at the other end in place with my fingers while I unscrew this one. I genuinely have no idea how you would ever get to the other nuts, it&#039;s in a hole in a wooden panel, with a drainpipe and other pipes and electrical wire around. It&#039;s like they put it in first and then did everything else on top of it - drainpipe, other plumbing, electrical wires - all built on top of it and now no proper access to it.",

Knee pads suck dick imo, some pipes would take like 30 minutes to polish and my legs would be falling asleep because of how hard you have to strap them around your knees to keep them from doing what they want. I much preferred pic related for polishing pipe. They were great because sometimes I would have to change positions and I&#039;d be on my side or back and it was much more comfortable to lay on the pad. The only drawback is sometimes I&#039;d have to polish multiple pipes so I&#039;d have to move around a lot and I couldn&#039;t drag the pad around because I&#039;d have a different pipe in each hand. YMMV<br><br>And &quot;tiling&quot; 17 &quot;floors&quot; a night Nissan pretty impressive, most pipes I&#039;ve polished was probably only 10 but that&#039;s counting each group of pipes as 1.",

You need to be more cautious with your clientele because you don&#039;t to invite them into your shop and have them make a mess of everything. But it makes things so much easier, even though my neighbors are starting to complain about the amount of packages that I get at all hours of the day. It&#039;s nice though, I can wake up when I want, have my coffee, go into my &quot;shop&quot; and grind pole all day.

They used to (still do) use paper cardboard and thin pieces of wood to pop an edge or side out on things like trim, doors and hardware, but they fall out easily and it&#039;s fucken annoying. So I started ripping the tape to size and then folding it back onto itself until I reach the correct thickness leaving a tail hanging off the main mass to stick to whatever I&#039;m shimming. Usually I will use multiple pieces to keep a choice fit &amp; finish. It&#039;s great because thickness is variable and it&#039;s easy to modify on the fly. I am admittedly a bit proud to have figured this out on my own because it&#039;s a real gamechanger getting pieces shimmed out quickly, easily and correctly. <br><a href=\"#p2932046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2932046</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s the only duct tape I buy anymore</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;keep a roll in the truck too</span><br>Same<br><a href=\"#p2932051\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2932051</a><br>Yes<br><a href=\"#p2932112\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2932112</a><br>A fresh piece in in heat will stick really good, but a used piece can lose some of its strength and become great for repeated use.",

The production home industry is almost entirely brown, but a lot of good subs use production homes to keep their guys busy throughout the year. The rest of the homes being built are all pretty good. There are still plenty of builders employing white men and building excellent homes, but they are expensive. My beef with modern construction is the use of materials like MDF and OSB instead of solid wood boards and plywood and also spray foam insulation. I also do not approve of the modern man&#039;s fascination with sealing everything. Shit needs to breathe or you get mold really bad. You WILL get leaks over time. OSB does not make good &quot;bones&quot;. It&#039;s good for a few years and then it readily deteriorates. Pests and fungus love it because the glue and soft wood. It is poor at handling moisture over time. Same with MDF. Spray foam totally eliminates your ability to monitor the condition of your infrastructure and makes taking your house apart a complete bitch. Quality plywood and T&amp;G sheathing are much better in the long run because they are stronger and they will last longer. This is important because a lot of building code allows you to replace your roof or siding without a permit as long as you don&#039;t touch the sheathing.",

Yes, they can be used to make toys, that is the use case for 90% of normies. However, with a good idea and an understanding of the limits of technology, they are the lowest barrier to entry for becoming an actual manufacturer with a real product. Keychains and flexi dragons do not a business make. However, if you have an actual real idea, the web design and software engineering experience and know how necessary to make it work with nothing but your own time and a little bit of money for hosting, it\u2019s the absolute best way to break free of your 9-5. One machine won\u2019t do it, no, but a fleet of printers costs many orders of magnitude less than a bunch of mills and lathes. Or, god forbid, injection molding dies. They\u2019re an excellent way for the engineer or would-be engineer to bring an idea to market. They are not money printers, as some mistakenly believe.",

This pulls cooler outside air into the attic from the other vents. Basically, increase attic air flow to lower the attic temperature. This helps reduce heat entering the conditioned space through leaks or radiating through the insulation and such. Simple, right?<br><br>The problem is many attics have poor ventilation to begin with. Creating negative pressure causes some air from the conditioned space to be pulled into the attic though cracks. This causes some outside air to get pulled into the conditioned space to replace it, defeature the purpose of the fan to begin with. Basically, they cause the same problem they are trying to solve, just in a different way, while also wasting electricity. Even worse, if your attic barrier is really leaky then can pull so much air from the conditioned space they can cause things like gas water heater vents to reverse flow and dump carbon monoxide into your home.<br><br>Why not just seal the barrier between the attic and the conditioned space super well and add more attic vents to solve that issue? Great idea! That will also negate the need for an attic vent fan in the first place. The whole idea of of an attic vent fan is to increase airflow in the attic to reduce the heat build up. Proper venting and sealing also does that.<br><br>The reason they are &#039;a thing&#039; is because they are cheaper and easier to install then to actually fix the main issue. Same with the solar powered ones, which are even easier to install. They sound legit but don&#039;t work out when you run the numbers. Some half-assed handy man or dogshit &#039;ventilation specialist&#039; can install them quickly and cheaply without having to radically change your venting situation. As long as you can cut a few holes, run some wire, and drive some screws you too can scam people with minimal effort.",

I let it cool for a while and hit it with a thread chaser and it&#039;ll be fine for a few turns but after I get to like 20 ft/lbs i take the bung clean off, leaving a lot of the filler behind. maybe it&#039;s bc it&#039;s stainless vs mild steel? maybe someone has an idea",

If thats the case, angle the torch to dump most of the heat into the bung near the joint, taking care not to burn the top edges off the bung, and when you add filler, try to &quot;wash&quot; it down onto the thinner tube indirectly by moving the torch downwards (move the torch, dont change the angle) each time you dab filler",

Still haven&#039;t gotten any more done on the welding cart. Been using the welder a bit though. Made a seat mount for my newly acquired Ford 1700 tractor, and fixed the broken throttle pedal assembly. Also used it to patch up $720 worth of floor panels for my rotary swather header. Not that I couldn&#039;t have done that with my other welder, but I&#039;m putting this one through it&#039;s paces since I didn&#039;t buy the extended 2 year warranty for $300. (Hell that is practically 1/3 the cost of the entire welder!) <br><br>I did manage to fuck up my ground cable by having one of those floor plates fall off my bench and chop it right in half. Oh well, I had some 50&#039; 1/0 leads laying around and cut one into a 20&#039; ground and 30&#039; stinger for it. Much beefier and way better than the 10&#039; leads it came with. Still haven&#039;t even tried the SMAW on it, only the MIG. It is definitely nice to just dial in your material thickness and it puts a recommended wire speed and voltage up. I&#039;ve been just running their recommended settings and they seem pretty damn good to me. I will definitely be upgrading the mig gun to a 15&#039; as the 10&#039; is just too damn short compared to my miller with the 15&#039;",

Then you would need to figure out the pin-out of that socket, this is more difficult. If it&#039;s 5 pin there is a hope that 2 of the pins are for the trigger, other 3 for the potentiometer/rheostat. Otherwise the trigger wires from the pedal will need to break out of the main cord and plug into those two banana sockets for the torch trigger. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;previous guy using it didn&#039;t seem to connect the ground on the 3 phase socket either and idk if it needs it or not</span><br>It definitely needs it, that guy is a moron.

The protective circuit breaker would trip. If the earth wire isn&#039;t connected inside the 3 phase plug, you would get electrocuted if you touched the machine chassis during the fault condition.",

I had talks with a instructor in the local trade school and training in a month. key points are that it&#039;s gonna last about 8 hours a day for 30 working days (month and a half) and it&#039;s prolly gonna be TIG first, and a diploma at the end. however TIG is mostly on terrain and I lack a driving license, so I might switch to MIG/MAG from the getgo so that I could be stationed somewhere and simultaneously earn money and study for the license. after that I will be a lot more flexible with job opportunities, escaping my shithole country, etc. <br><br>so tell me, o ye weldful, does 30 days (30*50 jewros per day) and TIG as a start sound like bullshit to you? of course I could dip out after first day or week so it&#039;s not gonna be a financial tragedy or whatever for me, but your opinions are still more than wanted. furthermore what could I do to learn more about welding with zero equipment and experience outside of jewtube tutorials? what do tutorials lack in general? perhaps some exercise for enduring certain positions? I&#039;m fit and do some basic lifting and posture exercise so I&#039;m certainly not gonna crawl my way home after the first day. that being said I always loved tinkering with stuff and basic electronics so welding should be alright for a job, if not then Imma look for doing chips or something.",

Tap it around a bit if it needs it to get it straight again and then tack another spot.

I need to get a machine but don&#039;t know where to start really. After some research, I think my best bet would be a 110v tig welder. I&#039;ve heard mixed reviews about 110v machines, but i dont have any 220v plugs. I don&#039;t really want run new wire to start welding, but I don&#039;t want to waste money on tools that won&#039;t preform either. It would be much appreciated if anyone could recommend a machine or setup<br><br>Pic kinda related, gonna start a mud mower project this summer",

This way you are not completely limited to 110v or purely running tig. If I had to choose only one single welding process it would probably be stick for its versatility and then mig for its ease of use. Finally followed up by tig.",

I like the idea of the multi process units, but i also question how much I will use the different processes. If I use the mig, it would probably be flux core so I don&#039;t have to fool with gas. Can I just get a stick welder and be covered in most areas? When would you really want to be using something other than stick welding? I see alot of people pushing the cheap harbor freight flux core welder, and it looks good for getting my feet wet. However, if stick can do everything a flux core welder could and more, then it would be a better investment for me",

Thin materials is where you will struggle with it because it will want to burn through. If you have small diameter rods and can turn your heat way down you should be able to get through it though. 6010 or 6011 for thicker dirtier materials. 6013 and 7018 on cleaner stuff or as capping welds. <br><br><a href=\"#p2924658\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2924658</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When would you really want to be using something other than stick welding?</span><br>Mainly for thin stuff. If you plan on doing a lot of thinner material then a flux core mig would also be a good choice. Or mig with shielding gas would be even better. Once again, a multi-process machine would have all that covered in case you want to upgrade to shielding gas. Tig would have to have shielding gas.",

Having no battery in between means the minute-long fluctuations in sunlight are going to influence the maximum power output significantly. Unless you\u2019re powering some sort of load that you can tell to draw less power, or a load that draws way less than 800W, it will be a difficult task. I\u2019d suggest trying to seal up the cracks, permanently mount them to your roof, and try to use them for a specific purpose that doesn\u2019t need an inverter, like hot water heating. You could even build a water jacket behind the panels to keep the panels cooler and longer lasting, and to preheat the water before you electrically heat it. Powering an air-conditioning compressor might be an interesting task that doesn\u2019t need a battery also.

The smart way to do that is to vary the PV current to map out the V/I curve every now and then, but a simpler way is to just set a maximum-power-voltage and use feedback to keep it at that, which gets you like 90% of the way there and can be done via analogue feedback loop.

Regardless of whether the Schmitt trigger is switching based off a nice integrated ramp triangle-wave, or off a curvy RC wave, your duty-cycle is controlled by a resistance.

Say they have an area of 5cmx10cm and a spacing of 1mm. That&#039;s 44pF, which at 0.5GHz is 7.2 ohms. I don&#039;t know how many significant figures you&#039;re trying to measure, but you may well find this RC constant to be smoothing out the sharp edges of the triggering spark-gap. Doubly so since the round-trip distance through the resistor is almost a nanosecond longer than the short capacitively-coupled distance.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The problem might rather be that certifying an arbitary length of coax for its resistance might be a bit overboard</span><br>Did you know that you can just put a known current through the wire and measure the voltage?

I don&#039;t see why integrators and triangles would help, but I am trying to solve this with analogue methods. My oscillator is basically just a simpler version of the integrator oscillator you already mentioned, and any methods for stretching on/off-times apply equally. I need 560us normally, but 1640us immediately when a digital output goes high (that&#039;s a ratio of 41:14, though maybe 3:1 is close enough...). That digital output does go high synchronously with this counter.

If it&#039;s a rail-to-rail input op-amp, then it can basically go all the way, and there are some special op-amps that can go beyond, but generally there&#039;s a volt or two dropout. A value of +/-13V means it can go within 2V of the lower rail and 2V of the upper rail when powered from +/-15V, and it&#039;s pretty safe to assume that 2V of dropout will remain roughly constant at other voltage rail sizes. Some datasheets even have a graph of this. Like this misspelt one from my Philips NE5534 datasheet. These graphs are kinda useless because of the zoom and coarse gradations, it would be better if they graphed the difference between the rail and input voltage (e.g. 2V) instead of the total voltage.<br><br>Some op-amps have an asymmetry on this feature, the OPA1642 looks to be capable of measuring 0.1V below it&#039;s negative voltage rail, while has to be 3.5V below its positive rail.

But OpAmp2&#039;s output can only go to (3V + V_forward_diode) (or slightly above if it tries to push). Since (3V + V_forward_diode) is less than 5V, D2 will be reverse-biased.<br><br>Result: Only the diode connected to the highest input voltage will be forward-biased and conduct.

But it can still be useful if your audio signals have different positive-going and negative-going amplitudes, which is always possible. Take a 1% duty-cycle square wave as an extreme example, when AC-coupled that little spike will be much more positive than the base of the wave is negative. I believe some compressors use full-wave rectifiers for sampling signal amplitude for this reason. Look for some existing schematics to see how they handle it, maybe they just amplify the signal to like 10Vpk and use regular diodes.<br><br><a href=\"#p2928386\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2928386</a><br>Wouldn\u2019t be very portable if you use an AC transformer for it. 600VA is a fair bit, enough to plug in your power tool chargers, laptops, test equipment, soldering equipment, etc. What would you want to use it for, boiling a kettle?",

It\u2019s best if your jumper wires are unimpeded and only run horizontally, but so whatever you have to. Often you will need to replace a footprint with a longer or shorter one, for this I click on the component in the layout, hit E to bring up the edit window, hit Change Footprint, and open up the dialogue for just the selected component. There I may swap a 7.62-long DO-35 for a 10.16-long DO-35. Then I\u2019ll hit my keybind for \u201cupdate schematic from board layout\u201d that I set to F9 and save both the schematic and the board.

Some time ago, someone has showed me a kind of gadget/toy that is an essentially a fast changing led strip that you can wave around to create patterns and do light painting. It was ridiculously expensive though, so I have decided with a friend to make on ourselves since it seemed pretty easy to do.<br>Today I finished second prototype. It uses ESP32 to drive a led strip that allows for an external clock so it can get much faster than typical addressable strip. For now I&#039;m using bitbanging for testing so it&#039;s only 150 fps, but with SPI this should allow for much more detailed patterns, especially if you swing it around on a rope.(I think it should support up to 3000 fps IIRC)<br>The circuit is quite simple, just the esp board, BMS, stabilizer, capacitors and buttons and leds.",

The UI is pretty shitty, with just 8 push-buttons, but it has all the features I\u2019d want in a portable scope if you can navigate to them.

Some scopes boast 16-bit resolution, which you may want to look out for, I doubt they go up to 24 bits.

Each time I turn it on I have to change the zero offset of the channels by a lot, and the zero-offset changes from analogue to digital mode.<br>Well, the scope was free so I\u2019m hardly complaining.",

That kind of bms mod would be cheaper than replacing all the cells, but I&#039;d probably want to do both. Apparently even the pricy milwaukee batteries don&#039;t do cell balancing.

Even cheaper if you just put the other end of the tube in your mouth. Though I&#039;d need to make a 3D printed adapter from the hollow tube to a silicone hose.<br>I can&#039;t find anything similar that will fit into T245, TS100, or 900M tips, but with the M4 threaded tips you can buy for heat-set insert dies, you can probably make an adapter block that fits the 929D-V tips.

I&#039;m tempted, but I already have a T12 station, a T12 USB iron, and the bits lying about to make a third one too. So I&#039;ll just shell out the 15USD for the cartridge tip alone.",

Radiative preheating might help, but because there\u2019s like ten pins to reflow you\u2019d want to actually melt them all at once, not just preheat. If those radiative things will actually melt solder, then with some shielding foil tape you could probably do a pretty good job. Even cheaper if you just buy one of the ceramic heating elements and tie it to a TRIAC dimmer. And mount it somehow.<br><br>As for those shitty PTC reflow plates, are they safe to use without any temperature control without damaging components or PCBs, while actually melting the solder? I was building a temperature controller for one, but recently I realised they have PTC elements within so maybe I don\u2019t need to. I\u2019m sure the changing tempco would mess up the PID loop, not that I couldn\u2019t correct for that.<br>Instead maybe I should just build a little box for a power switch and ground wire termination.<br><br>I\u2019m surprised nobody makes a large but cheap reflow plate that can set a proper reflow curve.",

You may be able to get rid of these with hollow desoldering needles (they&#039;re cheap as shit, at least give them a try), and maybe something like the 929D-V will be sufficiently better at getting rid of those remnants, but a way of melting all pads at once is likely what you want to go for. If I were you, I&#039;d probably buy the hot air gun, and some foil or kapton tape to mask off and protect areas from the hot air (this is important), but also pick up some desoldering needles and maybe $5-10 of bismuth. Hopefully you have some dead boards to practice on.<br><br><a href=\"#p2930479\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2930479</a><br>Dodgy volume knob probably just means the potentiometer is full of gunk and needs to be cleaned out. Easy job, the older pots can be pried open and put back together pretty easily, if not it&#039;s still a relatively cheap replacement. The same applies to switches, especially rotary or slide switches. Toggles and rockers are less prone to this. For the orientation-dependent power, I&#039;d assume something heavy has cracked a solder joint. Especially an iron transformer or heat-sinked transistors. Any components connected to the chassis of the unit and the PCB at the same time are also suspect, like connectors and controls.",

You could use a solid-state relay here as it would simplify things a bit, or you could use an optocoupler, but either way to get those TACH and PWM signals you&#039;ll need to connect the GNDs together.<br>One thing to consider is what will happen if the computer is turned off but the external PSU is turned on, or vice-versa. It&#039;s possible that the PWM signal could damage the fan if the fan isn&#039;t getting 12V, so it might be wise to add another MOSFET to that wire, picrel. The fan shouldn&#039;t get 12V while the PC is off because of the MOSFET I guess.",

To dim the light, you\u2019d just need to take a parallel branch off the 12V supply that goes into a potentiometer, in order to provide the 0-10V dimming input to the Luxdrive BuckBlock. Add another resistor if you want to limit it to 10V, e.g. if you have a 10k potentiometer use a 2k resistor in series with it on the 12V side.<br><br><a href=\"#p2931092\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2931092</a><br>Some switching controllers can generate clock offsets internally, though the most I\u2019ve seen is for 3 or 4 phases. 16 is a lot, man, are you doing tens of kW?<br>This kind of phase offset would best be done with a ring-counter, recently I tied two CD4018s together (with an inverter in between) to divide by 12, dividing by 16 would be doable too and you\u2019d have all the phase offsets from the 8 output pins and their inverses. Then just feed it a 1.6MHz clock. 100kHz is kinda low for a switching supply too.

If you want to properly send and receive packets on CAN, you\u2019ll probably want a microcontroller that can speak CAN directly, which the Arduino cannot. But an ESP32 can if I recall, you just need to wire its TX+RX CAN wires to a CAN transceiver chip/module, or maybe you can even find a dev-board with all that shit already on it. Arduinos and such can also be used with a different type of CAN transceiver, one that speaks normal serial or whatever back to the AVR microcontroller, but these are less flexible. I\u2019d search for a sufficiently popular CAN MCU dev-board and first test that you can receive steering data and show it on some little LEDs before buying the chinky headlights.

It&#039;s pretty common to see unpopulated pads on a lot of third party cards, Nvidia/AMD release a reference design and a lot of their board partners decide what to add or cut corners on from there. You can see this a lot with budget vendors who often use less VRM phases than the reference design.",

You&#039;d also live a very energy intensive lifestyle. You use all your purchasing power to buy all renewable power and generators for renewable power to consume it yourself. You&#039;ll even go as far as to make up use cases, like running electric heating and A/C at the same time.<br>This would leave no renewable energy or generators for that on the market for anyone else. Sure you can argue where &#039;neccessity&#039; begins but everyone else would definately have a few requirements they would have to turn to fossil energy to meet.<br>In short: Wasting renewable energy and the generators for it is wasting energy. If you found a way to remove the portion that is renewable of the market the demand it used to met would then be met by fossil, as a result of your action. If your &#039;use&#039; was pointless it would be wasted.<br>So what do:<br>No individual, if they want to claim fossil-free, should use more than the global availability of renewables minus the share that goes back into producing and maintaining generators for renewables divided by the number of individuals. If everyone did that fossil would be over in no time.",

Usually that stuff is public record, so it&#039;s pretty fucking easy to tell if a building is legitimate. You don&#039;t build your house in a way that someone else can demolish it with impunity, which is what a 1st world authority will force you to do if you don&#039;t abide by the laws of the land. It all depends on the specifics of your area, though. Every place has different laws and building code requirements. Some places are easier to build than others, so it might not even be that big of a deal to go through the building process. I know you don&#039;t see it now, but there&#039;s a good reason for building code and legislation. It is true that in some circumstances it is a bureaucracy and perhaps a hindrance to the common man, yet in nearly all cases it is a good protection for the people. Understand that the people ages ago still had building code and legislation. That shit goes back past Ancient Rome. They would kill you for violating some things, by the way, so consider yourself lucky there&#039;s no corporal punishment for that anymore. Use the stupid questions thread next time, btw.",

That is, if you a. get caught and b. the house doesn&#039;t fit any of the dozens of special cases where you don&#039;t need a permit to begin with. Here, most of those exceptions are centered around farming (my favorite example being that owning a single rabbit, and feeding him your lawn cuttings, means you can build a 100m2 / 6m high &quot;stable&quot; without any permits, then legally convert it into a regular house after 7 years, as long as the rabbit has died by then), and I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if there were exceptions like that in every developed country (other than the US, I guess, since they seem pretty allergic to freedom).",

But I&#039;m unsure, it&#039;s looking like most people just rotate the Z screws manually until it&#039;s level. Some even print knobs to make it easier to rotate the screws. Maybe you move the hot-end about and check the level with a piece of paper before tightening the belt again and telling it to do another mesh measurement. It&#039;s a documented process on Youtube.",

First I used a damp paper towel to wipe the glue stick off, then a dry one, then one with some 70% IPA on it, then a dry one, then a sloppy wet paper towel to really get as much of what was left off, and finally a dry paper towel to dry it, then heated it to 45 C for a few minutes to evaporate any residual moisture, then let it cool down to about 27-30 C before applying fresh gluestick as evenly as I could manage. Next I re-ran the bed probe sequence/mesh generation and re-ran the vibration test for good measure. I also realized that there are two hex screws that make it super easy to position the PEI plate because they line up with little angled spots on the build surface.<br><br>Bed adhesion was better but I still had some issues. Part of the problem is I&#039;m printing some really skinny parts and at first I was doing it in the mode where it prints all of one model then does all of another instead of layer by layer, so I dont think it was cooling enough. So I switched it back to layer by layer for more cooling time and also cut the first layer speed in half from 60mm/s to 30mm/s and that&#039;s done the trick for now. 1.5 inch letters are surprisingly difficult to print in PETG depending on what font you use.<br><br><a href=\"#p2928893\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2928893</a><br>I&#039;ll probably try this later when I have more time.<br><br>On a semi-related note, how does automatic bed leveling actually work? I get how the machine detects which parts of the bed are high or low, but what does it actually *do* about it? the K1 SE has 4 things in the corners of the build platform that I assume are little stepper motors with super high precision, but how would it maintain that when it&#039;s powered off?

If you have a halfway decent DSLR camera or generally just a decent dedicated camera, it may end up being better than what your phone can do. Real cameras have much larger sensors and better optics and do a better job of including important metadata in my experience. Larger sensors mean that even a nice nikon from 10-15+ years ago gave me images as good or better than my 2024 motorola camera did, despite being able to take up to 50 megapixel images if I dont use pixel binning. I have a coolpix camera from 2010 that has a 4k sensor on it that worked decently well too.<br><br>Combining images from different cameras might even be beneficial too. Meshroom can also use video, but I&#039;ve never successfully used it. Resolution isn&#039;t everything, and depending on how much RAM your computer has you will likely want to downscale some.<br><br>Try to keep extraneous detail out of your shots. My first attempt at making a model of a drill gave me a *remarkably* accurate model and color map of the wood floor I took the pictures on but a pretty garbage representation of the wood itself. After that I put copy paper down on the floor so it wouldn&#039;t waste CPU time mapping the wood grain.<br><br>If your object is relatively featureless or has a lot of symmetry (looks the same on the left and right for one example) you might want to give the software some artificial references. I drew different shapes on different parts of the paper with different color sharpies. I&#039;d have a black square, a red triangle, a purple x, etc. I used each color and shape only once to make it easier for it to orient itself. I also tried drawing patterns on the drill itself in pencil, like a zigzag on the left and sine waves on the right.<br><br>The other key is image quality. You want the subject to be in really sharp focus. If you can&#039;t get all of it in sharp at once, methodically take images of all parts from many angles where each section *is* in focus.",

From my understanding it&#039;s basically the same as the other K1 models but without the enclosure. It&#039;s fast, makes high quality prints, built well, has a variety of slicer options, (most/all are free and open source) seems to be designed with the specific intent of being easily repaired and upgraded/modified by the end user and community, and can print a wide variety of filament types (although I&#039;ve only used PLA and PETG so far). The PETG gave me a bit of trouble with bed adhesion, but it turns out the bed just needed a fresh glue stick coating and wiping it off with a paper towel and water, drying, and reapplying fixed it basically. if you want to print small stuff that has a tendency to detach or peel off the plate, just lower the first layer print speed down from the ludicrous 60mm/s to something only mildly insane like 30mm/s.<br><br>Overall I&#039;m really impressed, but fair warning my only other printers I&#039;ve used with any frequency are a clone of the flash forge creator pro 2-head machine (Qidi x-pro) and a makerbot z18 (which is solid and reliable if you play by it&#039;s rules, but is old and is totally closed source so it&#039;s a royal pain to use, plus it&#039;s huge and weighs 90 pounds)",

What if instead of just filling your build plate with segments, you also stacked them vertically, optimizing rotation and positioning to maximize space packing and trying to get as much of the support structure as possible printing from non-visible parts of other tentacles, and also just minimizing support material in general?<br><br>It sounds like you&#039;re already going through the effort of cleaning up and filling in layer lines so maybe support structure attachment points would clean up without any additional difficulty? Once you figured out the optimal packing configuration you could basically print a solid block of tentacles that consumes your entire build volume so you dont have to constantly be starting new prints.<br><br>I actually did something like this several years ago on my qidi x-pro. I was trying to print a full set of Mk VI MJOLNIR armor from Halo. (the one seen in halo 2 and 3) first of all there are a lot of overhangs to begin with, and literally every piece of the armor except for the two hand plates was too big to fit on my tiny little build plate without doing one or more plane-cuts in meshmixer to break them into pieces. Sometimes this could help the overhangs, other times it made it worse. But because there were so many huge overhangs, the amount of support material was absurd, so what I would do was print one segment and then position another that had a really tall overhang above it, that way it would start printing the support structure off of the first part and only have to use half the material.",

Not even just to make it less painful, but it adds to the experience of being inside a suit of power armor. Years ago I tried coming up with a kind of degradable airsoft armor. The idea was you could have a shield that would protect you from getting hit, but if it got hit enough it would eventually start to break apart and eventually fail completely. You could have multiple people all taking on one juggernaut with a shield kind of game type. The key is finding something strong enough to take a hit, but not so strong that it wont break eventually. I also wanted it to be something biodegradable or generally not plastic so we wouldnt have to pick up chunks of it. The best I came up with at the time was to make a rectangular mold with a grid of twine running through it out of a box lid and mix up and pour plaster into it. It behaved like i wanted it to but unless it was really small it would fall apart under it&#039;s own weight, which the twine was supposed to help with.

It could also be a lack of retraction, and Z-hop helps, but I\u2019d go full-ham drying it. Even new filament often needs drying before you print. Use a normal heated box with airflow to get it to ambient absolute humidity, and if that isn\u2019t enough, use a sealed heated box with internal airflow and a high-temperature desiccant like CaCl or molecular sieves. 100C fans are expensive though.<br><br>Printers like the A1 series have a silicone brush always at nozzle-height to wipe against (especially after filament changes) but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an option with the P1S. That said, people definitely add nozzle wiping brushes at the back by the poop chute, so printing a tiny brush holder and writing some g-code to get inserted each layer might be the way forwards.

The air would stay trapped in the cup and prevent it from sinking. Left it floating overnight and as soon as I touched it, it sank. What I have done now is put a lid on the cup with a smaller opening. Seems like its creating some surface tension to make sure the air doesnt escape or really let water in. If this doesnt work I think my options are to try making the hole even smaller and if that doesnt work then basically add a small perimeter a millimeter thick around the the opening.",

Not actually that much; claims of the health effects of printing ABS are largely overblown, but an enclosed printer in a ventilated room is a good idea, especially if you&#039;ll be working with it a lot. To make a comparison, the negative effects of chronic exposure to gasoline fumes are well-known, but you probably don&#039;t wear a gas mask every time you fill up your car, but it&#039;s a good idea to wear a respirator if you need to scrub something with it as a solvent.",

It is visible under the device tab of Bambu Studio, it is also visible in the filament section of the Handy app. <br><br>There are certain abrasive filaments that will accelerate wear and tear on the mechanical components of both the AMS and the rest of the filament path itself - like Glow In the Dark filaments, wood filaments, glittery filaments, glass filled or carbon fiber filaments, etc. Think about it. Ultra smooth plastic, like ABS, PLA, PETG? Nah, you\u2019re good. It will wear as normal.

What I want to do is put a spool on straps to tighten and pull around the spool. <br>what I want to do is set it up where i can put it on the back of some eyegoogles in a casing so I wouldnt have to worry about constantly replacing elastic straps. I know I could probably do something where I use a ratchet mechanism and make it simplier with some cord but straps feel better around the head then a cord. <br><br>I honestly just need to know of some gear pattern ideas that would help with what im trying to accomplish then I can go from there.",

Started selling some adapters from the p1p maybe a year later and got a p1s for different materials. The adapter product was basically seasonal for maybe a year. Stopped selling that product and the machines were pretty dormant. Picked up 2 a1 minis for another product that didnt work out. Had 4 machines basically offline. Ended up developing a new product that sells consistently. In the past two months I ended up creating 2 new products and now the p1s are at max capacity. Trying to add another 2 products this week to bring the a1 minis back online and hopefully get the third p1s doing a hybrid prototyping/production unit.<br><br>Its not a big farm yet, but the years of running these machines and doing all the CAD work and prototyping has me spinning up new products to try lightning fast. I wish I could say it was overnight, but it did take a ton of trial and error just to get to basically 6 machines. Lots of money and time wasted on dead end products. Im having fun with it so far though. Maybe if I get to like 50+ machines I might start to dread it a bit. Anyway thats my diary",

If your mainboard has UART comms lines to the drivers directly you can change this, otherwise I think they\u2019re not adjustable. But I think they\u2019re usually set to maximum microstepping anyhow, at least on cheap boards like the ender 3s. Say if you have 200 steps per revolution, multiplied by 32 microsteps, that\u2019s 6400 microsteps per revolution. If you have a pulley circumference of 36mm, that\u2019s a resolution of 5.6\u03bcm.

With injection molding you will probably do a run of like 1000 parts in just one color. I can easily do like 50 of one color and 150 of another. Dont have to keep inventory on hand really either. Right now the business is probably pulling like $13k profit a year and I maybe have like $200 in inventory and shipping supplies. Can run a lot more lean. There are some products I wish I could injection mold too though, but there are some instances where 3d printing makes a better part. With the injection molding you basically need the same thickness throughout the entire part or I think you get weird stuff like sagging. 3d printing I can make a part really thick in one area where needed and thin in another area.",

Like I have alluded to: Marlin2 appears to be enforcing a minimum speed. This is obvious from experiments I&#039;ve described: Below a certain speed all feedrates seem to. be trwated the same which is at lwast obvious from the same pitch of the stepper and also the move taking the same time for the given distance.<br>Inductive. A take on the LC topology but it does away with the coupling cap and instead the return path is switched. Interesting that someone else knows about that sort of stuff. Most people seem to only ever thing about RC topologies (to be fair I&#039;ve seen<br>one machine that used what is basicay a buck converter to charge the caps lossless). Anyways my intentions is to get the waveforms, the dependable discharge current and especially the ~2 kV open gap voltage compared to the maybe 70V some guys are running. The circuit does burn nicely in low power experiments so far. It needs to be reworked from the EMI side before the power and rise times can be upped. <br>So yeah is there an easy way that lets me compile a variant of marlin2 that runs as slow as you tell it to?",

Have you done a custom build of Marlin for this machine? There may be a setting in there about minimum feedrate. Even if that doesn&#039;t fix things, it&#039;s still a handy idea so you can set certain GPIOs to output high-speed PWM. That&#039;s what I did for my Ender 3 V2 laser engraver. You could also try some other software, like GRBL or whatever.<br><br>My idea for an EDM driver is as shown. I&#039;d store energy in an inductor by keeping Q3 turned on while alternately turning Q1/Q2 on like a buck converter to reach a desired current. Then the g-code would release this energy into the workpiece by turning Q3 off, making a big voltage spike at the inductor until it flashes across the tool. I think you could make it produce bidirectional pulses by making it a full H-bridge, but that would require more HV-rated transistors.<br>The important part of my design is that it doesn&#039;t require an expensive AC-to-DC converter, any existing LV supply like an ATX or even a deep-cycle lead-acid battery would do the trick.<br><br>2kV sounds challenging to switch, though these days with SiC transistors it&#039;s hardly out of the realm of possibility.",

I could probably find a way to turn the nob into both the release and the tightner but thats for another version. Sorry for the shitty drawings but this is how id explain it.",

Theres just too many barriers to entry like knowing how to orient the print, slice it, what materials to use, where to get files, how to make your own files, etc etc. Knowing how to 3d print is basically a skilled trade as silly as it sounds. You can learn a lot of the basics in a few days and be competent enough to be dangerous, but it takes a while to get skilled at and really unlock its usefulness.",

I kept the motion board and made bare minimum changes to vanilla marlin to make it work.<br>My whole reasoning was that I might get this to work quick (that time is long gone) because as it turns out whatever drive I use needs shielding and can not just be wired up flopping in the breeze. The printer is fully enclosed and I figured it would be decent enough shielding and it having it&#039;s own PSU provides some galvanic isolation to the mains.

So I&#039;m confused now.<br>Regarsing the G-code part: EDM operations usually call for a certain spark gap length and surface finish and you determine parameters based on that and factors like electrode and work material and dielectric. Once you chose that you just have an oscillator stoically go on about its business. No need to put lines in G-code for individual sparks, the operator doesn&#039;t even know how many (countless anyways) discharges a part of the geometry needs. So... discharge 50.000 times then advance in a certain direction? Seems like alot of repetitive G-code.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bidirectional pulses</span><br>You usually don&#039;t want that.

Few quick pointers:<br>E=0.5L\u2022I^2. As soon as you dump any E into the spark gap, which is the end goal, I WILL be greatly reduced since L is a constant. So current will not be constant. You will never switch fast enough, let alone get feedback from a hall device, and process it, fast enough, to keep up with the GHz signals you&#039;re getting from insulation breakdowns. Also since you don&#039;t choose Vin equal to the open gap voltage (the whole point) I will drop anyways as the potential difference over L is reversed and escalating in quick order.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Buck converter</span><br>Yes. But you want to make a buck cobverter with an intentionally shitty output filter. You said it yourself: Diode or FET (right or wring way round), you will be wasting energy. Only to have a lower floor for the stored energy at any time (there&#039;s an easier way to do this btw, had to do that once). Use case for the stored energy? You pump her up and let her fly. Insert dead time if it&#039;s needed for thermal reasons. Then start again fron 0.<br>Know films where they show medieval archers using longbows at the ready to let go? Pull out a bow like that and you&#039;ll know why no one would do that. You pull such that you&#039;re just ready to let go when it&#039;s time. Same here.

Using a complementary stage. I&#039;ll just say: Perhaps work on some simple things like some nice gate drivers for soft switchibg of ancient IGBT modules, some motor drivers...

So if you are drying those you are already goofing. If your prints are delaminating when removing then you are using bad filament. I just bought a roll of PETG that is completely unusable. If you are using supports then that could be another problem. If your bed isnt cleaned with soap and water or isopropyl alcohol then the supports could be lifting. Some models are just janky too, a lot of people make shit in blender and upload the file with no regards to designing with printing in mind. You start messing with a lot of overhangs etc on some capeshit print and its over for you. I mainly only design my own stuff so my prints come out good 99% of the time. Really only have had issues with nozzle wear, bad filament, unclean plates, and a few other things. Have probably run 500+ spools across 6 different bambu printers. I dont think its the printer unless you got some random lemon.",

I&#039;ve also set 400 for homing and factor 0.3 for holding. So if R_Sense 0.11 is correct (cant be bothered, it&#039;s a BTT V1.1 and Vref measured about 1V). Then thats that. I considered designing one of those channels, so I can mount the fan upright in the dead space and have it blow through that, if needed. <br>I am not getting 1mm/min and below on X, Y and Z. Z still is surprisingly noisy, maybe threaded rod vs belt?<br>Dimensions seem okay by eyeball and 1mm/min on Z sounds real cool like the waves coming in at the beach. Probably thanks to that interpolated sinusoidal waveform.<br>High speed still works fine. I was worried at first. So I guess I can still print.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;picrel</span><br>The electrodes I last used in manual experiments are just pieces of brass and graphite. Manual meaning using a flexure and a micrometer screw to feed so that it sounds about right. At 10s of kHz you cant look at every event on the scope so you have to tell by sound what the current probability for discharge is. Tap water and lamp oil as dielectric. <br>I made a crude dial gauge holder for the toolhead once. I&#039;ll use that. Or glue shit directly to the toolhead kek. Empty food container, slap some steel in and feed something through, hopefully. Lets hope the steel box is good enough for the EMI. I dont want the thing to go full spastic with a cup of lamp oil on the bed. Experiments are low power currently so dont expect big ass holes, also EDM is worse by a factor of maybe 1e3 compared to conventional cutting operations. So it wouldnt be the righg choice to fuck a big ol hole into something anyways.",

Ironically I&#039;m pretty sure the lack of flushing is the biggest problem right now. Hence the printer. There&#039;s two ways to do it: Pump and flood or regularly retract with high jerk, like a plunger. &#039;Self-pump&#039; if you want. Which is why the decision to get the printer working in this capacity. But subjectively I like lamp oil so far. Also things just dont corrode, like linear hardware and such. But whatever you use, the amount of swarf or sludge that is generated is always crazy high and it&#039;s absolutely disgusting. Which is where the flushing problem stems from. When you manually control it you&#039;ll find you could swear the gap will eventually start shribking instead of growing. My guess it&#039;s the swarf under the electrode taking more room than it did when it was still a solid.<br>So yeah I&#039;ll try programming that next. The pumping. It&#039;s outside the scope of my work but I won&#039;t ever be satisfied doing things I see some researchers doing:<br>Either blast holes through mu thick material or alternatively blast and analyze a single pulse crater. We don&#039;t do gay shit here. I need absurd machining operations that are real use cases for EDM completed. Like 100 mu holes with ridicolous aspect ratios. Maybe I should to the good old &#039;hole through the side of a ball bearing&#039; soon.<br>But all that will need sorting the swarf situation.<br>I&#039;d love feedback. Like add a feature to the planner where it keeps track of last moves and is prepared to backtrack. This would be triggered when a short is detected and would be a must for wire EDM. You can not blast the wire free once you have a short, you&#039;ll break the wire. And if you use more than one axis in one direction (aka Z axis sinker EDM) you need to know where you came from to fix a short without another short.",

Maybe Klipper would be more capable? It could potentially notice a short, then use meme scripting on the SBC to write a piece of g-code that does the opposite of your current move.

It would be real bad news to accidentially charge the inductor for arbitary time.<br>But it also has a function similar to the R in RC generators. The |Z| of the C is very different for the transient than it is for the ~DC. So you have a capacitive-resistive divider that allows for the full output voltage to appear on the inactive gap and then allows full current flow when the transient happens.<br>The R in RC does something similar, just at a fixed value while only the gap changes from high to low impedance. Without the RCs R the spark once struck would burn indefinately. So it allows charging when gap is high impedance and allows snuffing the spark when gap is low impedance. Too low of an R in RC and you got an arc.

Usually the supply voltage for the inductive design will be was too low to sustain and arc anyways but suppose for some reasom (mo powah babe) you went above 50V on the supply side the cap will still protect you from arcs as it only lets the transient pass and with the inductive process it&#039;s hard enough the way it is to store proper amounts of energy. You wont risk accidentially storing too much. Also the characteristic waveform of the discharge current is a very steep rise and gradual decline. Other way round than with caps.<br>When you do away with the cap you wil need a switch instead. So again: You get to decide the time when there definately won&#039;t be something flowing. If you tried it without the cap and switch you could not only short but also arc, if supply voltsge permits it.

While the other is &#039;funny shaped cavity making&#039;. I&#039;d say drilling wonky holes but that&#039;s often actually a bad use case.<br>Conventionally machine the molds for pic related. Cant W-EDM it either. I guess sibker EDM it is.<br>Yeah I think the fact that you get to keep your entire electrode in ECM is really cool. Imagine you could use the process with a wire. No need to spool the wire. Bit I guess if you short, even on slurry, you will wear the tool.<br>Fucking transistor is still alive. Meh.",

Even bolts-plus doesn&#039;t have it in stock. Are there any other good places to get miscellaneous fasteners? I&#039;d like to avoid paying international shipping if possible.<br><br>Specifically I&#039;m looking for something like pic related. M8-1.25x20mm, with some kind of black finish. It&#039;s for a structural component in my car which is also visible to the passengers, so I&#039;d like it to blend in, hence the black finish. It doesn&#039;t need to be torx, but it should have a similar head shape. I think it&#039;s a truss head, since the diameter is around 17mm, bigger than standard M8 button heads. I don&#039;t wanna buy from scamazon since it&#039;s for a structural application and I want to make sure the steel is good.<br><br>Also feel free to have a general discussion on sourcing hardware/fasteners.",
