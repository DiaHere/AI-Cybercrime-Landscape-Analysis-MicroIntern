After nothin on /ic/, I&#039;m gonna post my sloppy attempt at a logo here for a fantasy concept of mine, stylized as &quot;nOdream&quot;, as in the phrase &quot;this is no dream&quot;. I thought it was mysterious and loaded with both positive and negative feelings, plus juxtaposing strong and conflicting words like &quot;no&quot; and &quot;dream&quot; together. Additionally, I believe it to be an anchor of sorts, a reminder for when even the most bizarre set pieces are explored or the most beautiful or terrible things happen.<br><br>The big &quot;O&quot; is representative of the world, while the warped lettering was meant to make it whimsical. I could play around with a few more styles for the typography for sure. The other reason for the letters being warped was to create a symbol of sorts that could be easily recognizable even to non-English speakers. Thoughts?<br><br>Originally, I was calling this &quot;Key to the Kingdom&quot;, but after getting gummed up with lore and trying to make sense of what kingdoms go where and then having to reconcile set pieces I wanted with climates and so on, I got to a breaking point where I said fuck it and recommitted myself to focusing on individuals even as big things happen around them. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll even give kingdoms names anymore, but write an indecipherable hash in place. With the importance of &quot;kingdoms&quot; reduced, I needed a new title, something more personal and unusual. This is what I landed on.",

        "com": "Source is internal editorial material used for marketing rollout planning (not final footage). I have access to the writeup for the July 22 Pok\u00e9mon Presents and some WCS promo outlines. As proof of access, I have an unreleased Sylveon ex from the Eevee Grove TCG mini-set. Official art, not public yet.<br><br>Presents opens with Legends Z-A. All three starters are shown mega evolving in silhouette, one after another. Then we see Mega Drampa, Chandelure, Falinks, and Starmie. Pokemon Champions trailer: Z-Move auras look way better, Dynamax is mostly the same but the clouds are more detailed, and Mega Evolutions now have the rainbow aura from Z-A key art. Terastalization is getting a massive glowup, crystal lighting and refraction look amazing. The editorial ends with a Gen 10 teaser, similar to the Z-A reveal, but instead of holograms, the region&#039;s made of marble. We see landscape but not the actual map. Names are blurred out, but the color scheme is pastel blue and pastel yellow. Full Gen 10 reveal is tagged for the 30th Anniversary in February.<br><br>Worlds will feature the new TCG Pocket set themed around Xerneas and Yveltal. This set introduces Mega Cards to the format. Mega Excadrill and Mega Clefable will be revealed there. There&#039;s also more Champions content in the Worlds feed, showing Champions and a better look at Gmax forms (not in the Presents). Mega Drampa and Mega Chandelure will get longer spotlight sequences. Champions will be released in Q3 2026.<br><br>Holiday season will introduce a real world TCG Pocket adaptation, internally called Project Akachan. It\u2019s based on the Genetic Apex digital set, but includes a few crossover cards from other sets. Will feature Kanto Mega cards.",

Pick a niche you actually know something about I focus on digital tools and SaaS products because I genuinely use them and understand which ones are good. Find something you can talk about naturally.<br>2. Find good affiliate programs on sites like Clickbank etc. Some pay 20-30% per sale commission which is where the real money is.<br>3. Look for recommendation threads on twitter, reddit, discord fb etc. People are asking &quot;What&#039;s the best tool for X?&quot; or &quot;Alternative to Y?&quot; New threads are gold mines. I just search for these daily. (Use keyword notifications tools)<br>4. Leave HELPFUL comments This is key - don&#039;t just drop links. I write thoughtful responses that actually help solve their problem, mention my experience with the product, then casually include my link.

I was a professional gd for almost 10 years working in both studios and on my own and I can&#039;t really find a job anymore. It&#039;s not even because of AI to be honest, its because of how the industry works and how bad the corporate environment has become. <br><br>There&#039;s still web design, 3D and VFX/motion design(primarily 3D too) and if you want something similar or easy to transition then chose one of those but I&#039;m not sure for how long they will be relevant themselves because of the AI which is basically a final nail in the coffin of gd. Of course there are and will be exceptions and maybe you will get lucky to find some obscure local business that needs you, but if you are young and looking for a career in the future you should stop consider becoming a graphic designer.

The amount of different work that is done by one person today is the same amount of work that was done by 5 different people 10 years ago. And they pay the same salary for that. For that reason graphic design pretty much just vanished from existence because every single aspect of it can be done by other people in the field. So as a result &quot;designer&quot; profession was reduced to junior webdev monkey. Yes, there&#039;s still a chance to land a job but it&#039;s so small the majority of people physically won&#039;t be able to find them or it is already filled with nepobabies. Graphic design became a very very rare job. It&#039;s like a cartographer. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how bad the corporate environment is</span><br>It is toxic and inhuman. Corps cucked wagies so hard they start to behave like black people in 1790s. The house nigger says shit like &quot;you can&#039;t deal with the competition, it is a completely fair market&quot; while working 12 hours a day for food with his weekend filled with obligatory critical race theory training. Even if you are skilled enough for a position you first need to fight the HR bullshit so the quota-bitch can determine if you are the right person to align with the &quot;company&#039;s values&quot; like selfies on linkedin how you can&#039;t go to office because of covid and now you are crying. You literally have to be a slave to the company, you can&#039;t have a life outside of it. <br><br>And now we also have AI which will absolutely kill the freelance and small business clients. I think motion design will be gone the last because AI still kinda shitty at making videos, but it&#039;s only a question of time. UI/UX can also relax for maybe 2-ish years because right now AI is bad at small details and typography. Overall we pretty much witnesses of new industrial revolution, unironically. If you yourself have a graphic designer job I&#039;m happy for you, but please consider plan B.",

I didn&#039;t even think of perusing any design-related jobs as everyone told me they were competitive as hell and I just didn&#039;t have that drive. <br><br>I have no illusions of getting a design job but I still want to be able to creative aesthetically pleasing designs even if it&#039;s just for fictional products that never get made.",

Find something you like, hyperfocus on something, get yourself to draw a bit every day. Learn basics like perspective, quick gesture drawing will help a ton with drawing humans with more life to them. Don&#039;t get caught up in making everything perfect, the first things you make are gonna suck. Sketch things up, try going for 5+ variations of things to see what works best, forcing yourself to come up with more beyond your first idea helps creativity a lot. Look up tutorials if you get stuck on something. Can&#039;t figure out why something looks wrong? Draw that detail over and over to try to work it out. Lastly, don&#039;t rush it. Especially if you&#039;re not trying to make a living out of it, putting really any amount of effort into it will bring improvement.",

If you are a graphic designer or programmer that gets replaced by ai, it ultimately doesn&#039;t matter. Just look at how many jobs have been replaced back in the day. People will be fine, if you have the power to design or program, you can always hop into the trades. The jobs are as safe as you delude yourself to their inherent instability. Once you see it, you cannot unsee it. Now close this tab, enjoy a clean canvas or write a script or something. Give the crybabies less of your attention.",

It was a topic that my teachers talked about a DECADE ago, how to emphaise the local aspect and easy on the fly changes but now with English global proficiency, translators and many different webshops with thousands of freelancers who live in lower cost countries or students willing to work for $500 to make an entire website you, it&#039;s extremely dire for the middle to lower market for graphic designers. <br><br>The upper tier will be fairly safe, bespoke graphic houses will always be in demand from corporate clients but when you can actually just use a template for $100 (a problem that existed also a decade ago), premade websites like Shopify with no little upfront costs, widgets and plugins that allow you to customize basic templates for a small fee to get that bespoke feeling.... why should smaller businesses pay for $5000 websites + yearly support packages with limited changes + webserver costs again when they can easily do it themselves for 1/4th the cost? <br><br>Only the lowest dominitor businesses like local candlemakers who are clueless and never typed into google might give local design shops a go, which is probably still a lot of them but anyone who is remotely savvy will see the top three webpage results, know they can get a product that does 99% of what they want for 25% of the fee.",

Just cold call or email them. It&#039;ll help you feel less despondent and even if nothing comes of it, why not just try and apply some of your learnings into personal art projects to build some kind of portfolio to use for your next work prospect. <br>Having a technical edge to graphics and design puts you well ahead of many in the industry where all they know is how to use online design software and a working knowledge of photography and not a lot else.",

I didn&#039;t have to move or anything, but if I wanted to there are even more available jobs. When you first get your degree you should look for a prepress job. There are tons of openings and this is very beginner level work and arguably better than an internship. Print isn&#039;t dead. I work in the decorated apparel market, which is expected to reach a value of around $96.5 billion by 2033, growing from a 2023 value of $29.2 billion. Advertising in print IS dead, print itself is as strong or stronger than ever AND projected to triple every 10 years. That sucks for magazine brands and for the press workers, but that has nothing to do with the availability of jobs for Graphic Designers.",

The title &#039;80s Corporate High-Tech&#039; (or &#039;80s Futurism&#039;) is tentative but basically this covers much of &#039;Cassette Futurism&#039; (which dips into the 70s), the retrofuturist typography used in the 80s (and late 70s), the futurist/technophilic portion of &#039;Airbrush Surrealism&#039;, and includes the design trend referred to as &#039;Laser Grid&#039;. So just as Y2K Futurism (or &#039;Cybercore&#039;) contains multiple design trends within it (such as Vectorheart and Metalheart) so does 80s Futurism. The aesthetic glorified high technology, and with a particular interest in the advancing age of personal computers (often due to tech companies commissioning ads for their products). It often depicted basic 3D geometric shapes, early computer displays and virtual worlds (i.e. the infamous laser grids), outer space as a backdrop for depicted objects, ostentatious displays of the color spectrum (to signify advanced tech capabilities), stylized parallel rows of lines or strips (but usually not as playful and exuberant as with 70s supergraphics), airbrush-style metallic surfaces and exaggerated sparkles, retrofuturist typography, &#039;boxy&#039; angular imposing SciFi designs for vehicles, tech products, and interior design which were usually white, beige, or gray. The airbrush art tended to be visually darker, more surreal than the preceding variants of retrofuturism, and the tech product designs would have a noted &#039;boxiness&#039; to it as opposed to the &#039;roundedness&#039; of the preceding futurist product designs of the 60s &amp; 70s. The common thread was that it all looked like it was from some 80s science fiction film. 1/2",

        "com": "And here&#039;s another broad umbrella of styles which, together, comprise a certain aesthetic that emerged in the late 80s as a naturalistic reaction to the technophilic excess of that time. It eschewed computer-generated imagery for the &#039;earthly&#039; feel of hand-painted arts and crafts, soft pastel colors, and down-to-earth typography. It typically consisted of stereotypical depictions of tribal art, painted spirals, symbols of Earth &amp; nature, as well as borrowing from a variety of early 20th century art movements. The visual styles of GVC (Global Village Coffeehouse) are diverse enough for it to be broken down into subgenres but they overlap a lot and they&#039;re individually not significant enough to merit it since they&#039;re all watered-down imitations that share a similar appeal and commercial purpose. The common thread among them would be a tunefulness with nature, the feeling of humanity being united, and a sort of cheesy \u201cwelcome to our cafe\u201d commercial appeal. Sometimes it consisted of photographs of a product in a naturalistic setting with dimmed or natural lighting and with it being surrounded by sand or straw. It was often used by companies to make their products more inviting to normal everyday people who might feel estranged by the tech world. In this sense, the intent behind it bares some resemblance to the intent of Frutiger Aero. Some people eventually found the aesthetic to be inauthentic, embarrassing and distasteful so it would soon be ditched after the 90s.<br><br>https://www.are.na/evan-collins-152<wbr>2646491/global-village-coffeehouse<br>https://cari.institute/aesthetics/g<wbr>lobal-village-coffeehouse<br>https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/<wbr>Global_Village_Coffeehouse",

Then you have to edit the selections to optimize color richness &amp; detail, which can involve upscale software and photoshop.

After all, time and again there is the need for a text to look \u201chandwritten,\u201d and it is always easier to have a typeface available rather than actually writing the text with a utensil on paper, scanning it and positioning a large multi megabyte graphic within a document.</span>",

This is a RAR archive of over 18,400 fonts. Someone gave me a buttload of them years ago. I have not used them all so you&#039;ll just have to take a look. Been file sharing a long time so - I am not certain if Google can scrape RAR archives for licensed files or not with fonts - so I have added a password to the archive just in case. The file name IS the password! ( abc123 ) So when extracting just type that in.<br><br>And you&#039;re gonna need a font viewing program or something - I would not recommend just installing them all - older versions of graphic programs do not like to load that many fonts. Like older versions of Illustrator (CS2 and prior) won&#039;t show your installed fonts on the list when you go over 1,100 or something.<br><br>Inside the archive there are 3 folders:<br>VARIOUS_UNZIPPED this is most of them, around 15,000 QTY<br><br>VARIOUS_SYMBOLS this is all symbol fonts - like wingdings and stuff. GREAT for snagging a lot of cool vector art, around 1500 QTY<br><br>CURRENT_SYSTEM these are my currently installed ones - you&#039;ll find more modern and useful ones, around 2000 QTY<br><br>Of course many of them have various styles as different files so - it&#039;s not gonna be quite that number.<br><br>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pH<wbr>gOadl6nYDVI0jcsfGJ5vHZNDnF6N11/view<wbr>?usp=sharing<br><br>ENJOY!",

Take a look on how old covers from EGM and other magazines of the early 2000s used the main picture. That way you can remove the duplicate on the top left.<br><br>And you should understand that early 2000s internet were an age where people had hope on the future the internet and computers would bring, and people were very experimental with what you could make with computer graphics softwares.

Also, I think it would help to edit her to look more like her photo was taken in the early 2000s. Look it up like album covers and pictures in general from that time period, try to edit the picture to replicate that style. Also, I actually like the duplicate on the top left, but I just think it needs to be placed on the composition a lil better, and maybe frame it with something, like maybe it\u2019s in a webcam overlay.",

Computers from this era had as much as 1/1000th the memory, storage, and processing power. There are probably features that would give it its distinctive look that no longer exist because they were intended to save resources. If you were to attempt to make the same thing on modern software running on a modern system, it would probably look &quot;enhanced&quot; in a way that would make it look like a different style. It might be worth exploring, you might end up contributing to the next thing in design. Anything is better than the flat shit they&#039;ve had us sucking on for the past ~10 years.",

I keep ending up in shitty companies where I\u2019m expected to do everything while getting paid less than gate keeper. For the past 10 years, I\u2019ve designed websites, logos, mobile apps, print materials, books, t-shirt prints, labels, packaging, product photography, social media content, 3D designs, modeling, animation, and simulations. If I had focused on one thing from the start, I\u2019d be an expert in a specific field by now and making decent money. Unfortunately, the harsh truth is this: if you are able to do anything that means you are good at nothing. When there are job listings for simple graphic work, they don\u2019t want someone with 5+ years of experience. If they do want someone with 5 years of experience, they expect an expert in one particular niche. Today, no one even wants to spit in my direction. No one is looking for a 35-year-old guy who has done everything (but nothing specific) because they have 100 young, dynamic grads fresh out of college to choose from. The competition in the big city is just too strong. For the past 5 years, I\u2019ve been working from home part-time, and somehow manage to pay the rent. The MS diagnosis broke me. Depression, no friends, far from family, always making excuses. If it weren\u2019t for my wife earning well and help from my in-laws, I\u2019d have nothing. It feels like everyone around me is doing fine, earning well, and building great careers - except me. I\u2019m feeling down, I\u2019m sick of this fucking city and its weather. I just needed to get this off my chest.",

Hence no one cares for you, you arent competitive anymore, as the guy half your age will diligently do everything and more to &quot;create a career&quot;. That&#039;s a meme of course. Ideally you would already have enough money to enslave other. As this isn&#039;t the case, you need to position yourself correctly. Forget companies, this won&#039;t work, with the exception of nepo ties. What&#039;s speaking against frealancer work?

There is a mix of styles, icons that don&#039;t match (if you don&#039;t know what to use, use the icons on the google library), lack of icons, colors that don&#039;t mean anything, all the same weight type just changing size, no hiearchy, barely any alignment.<br><br>tl;dr: it looks like you jumped to the low fidelity design without the wireframing phase and you are showing it as if it is the final product. Invest time, git gud, then think about getting a freelance.",

I&#039;ve tried following some tutorials with where they say to make an alpha channel and then select+delete but the image I export still has a white background. I got something to work by making that alpha channel, deleting the white, using a rectangular select and copy + pasting-as-new-image, but I imagine that there a way that is simple and doesn&#039;t require making a new image.",

On the digital watch it gives a quick visual reference of where the important data is contained- not very consequential on a single watch but if you had an entire panel of displays nested together it can help the eye to organize them and exclude extraneous space when scanning them.<br><br>It absolutely serves a technical purpose in some applications and that&#039;s why it&#039;s used to convey a &quot;high tech&quot; or &quot;performance&quot; aesthetic on products where that&#039;s a selling point, even where there&#039;s no need and/or its location can&#039;t possibly serve any practical purpose.

Binder advises designers to consider color&#039;s physical and psychological factors. Citing Newton and Goethe, he suggests that the optical illusion of an afterimage shows that the eye is capable of producing color on its own and this connects to \u201cour innermost human disposition. We need green to free ourselves from red. We need yellow to counterbalance blue.\u201d Regarding the psychological effects of color, Binder forwards the idea that changing the natural colors of objects, if done carefully, can create an element of surprise.&quot;</span><br><br>Lots more cool examples of his and others work of that era&#039;<br><br>https://www.history.navy.mil/our-co<wbr>llections/art/exhibits/conflicts-an<wbr>d-operations/navy-recruiting-poster<wbr>s-of-the-atomic-age.html",

That being said, those perfume ads are the epithome of &quot;advertising propaganda&quot; as they sell a product but 99% of the ad is showing how you should feel with it.<br><br>You considering that Obama is a commie, that he is very far different than a republican, etc, was built on propaganda. Was it a couple ads you saw? No. Was it trying to sell you a product? No. It was a well crafted subset of ideas spread by a large group composed by the planers, the inside group who spreads, the LARPERs and the true believers. Lets use the Trump-Russia election interference example: It was thought by a group, then the briefing was hand out for the owners of big media people (these people know exactly their place), then handed out for the big names of big media that spread it in their news programs (some believe, some don&#039;t, but they play the same game), and then it comes the job for the LARPERs that believe spreading it will benefit them and the true believers to spread it in a myriad of platforms IRL, online or whatever. Oh was posters on a wall needed? No. This propaganda had any aesthetic attached to it? No. That does not mean that propaganda does not benefit by art or by an aesthetic characteristic, but they are different things.<br><br>Advertisement and propaganda can be in the same piece, but they does not mean the same. &quot;oh but i found a retard who says it does&quot; ok man, believe what you want to believe, but knowing your enemy makes you at least more prepared to not fall for blatant propaganda.",

The issue is consistency, you must be consistent in your technique or every element looks like garbage.<br><br>For example you can use a hard outline against gradient blocks to preserve your hard corners, that&#039;s valid, but if you do that you have to do it everywhere and not mesh other gradients.<br>If you mesh gradients and lose your hard internal edges, you have to loose them more or less everywhere, the shadow under the chin is meshed but the one above the lip is not, so both look like trash.<br><br>If your image has one point shadow (this one does), you can&#039;t then back-shaddow to achieve a gradient. So in this image the nostril shadow is consistent with the one point shadowing of the chin and the image overall; but the backs hadow from behind the nose seems to come from nowhere and be cast in no drection. Shadows are always cast, they are not the &quot;color&quot; of the skin area.<br><br>And it may seem like I&#039;m being picky; but that&#039;s what this style and design is, that&#039;s what separates an artists work from AIslop, it&#039;s the consistency of technique. There is no right or wrong way to vector, but there are styles, and AI generates civually so just uses a total slop of styles, it just uses the best visual match, it doesn&#039;t know how to interpret images the &quot;wrong&quot; way so as to preserve the overall style of a work.<br><br>I make this point often, to clients, in defence of hand drawn work of many styles. Mixed technique is a dead give away of AI rendering and it looks both sloppy and generates progressively weaker assets. When you accept these errors, you accept a cascade of errors, and AI just eats it&#039;s own stylistic errors over and over until you get the classic degenerate art form we all associate with globohomo.<br><br>I&#039;m hardly a master of vector art, but that&#039;s the underlying reason it should be respected and why it is used in virtually all commercial contexts",

Which states them as sources of color but not colors on their own right. Before our modern understanding of light waves most color models lacked the color white black or grey. This was due to the fragmentation of light through a prism, which only produced chromatic colors. The general consensus was that the perception of light and dark was not color itself but shades of light. <br><br>I personally agree with these model&#039;s. Pure black, white and grey are achromatic, which means do not contain a hue. I would say a black and white image is &quot;without color&quot; wouldn&#039;t you?",

So my question are:<br>How do I use my plotter machine to precut the thicker cardstock/foam without actually cutting it through and what&#039;s the process called? Half-cut? Scoring? <br>I learned from my experience that I can&#039;t really print directly on the foam as the surface are too smooth for my inkjet printer. How should I go about this? Yes, I&#039;m a small artist just make do in anicon and need to include that diy model kit from cardstock/foam as an add-ons on my printed doujin copies. :DD",

Which artists or companies were originally responsible for it? Who were they inspired by? What in the cultural zeitgeist was it pulling from? Was there a change in graphics technology, material science or design requirements that prompted it? How did the aesthetic change over time? Are there other aesthetics that pulled from similar sources, or that it &quot;evolved&quot; from, or split into?<br>For Gen X Soft Club, CARI&#039;s site does mention the 60/70s nostalgia, but one could talk about how the rigid grids of early web design and limitations of early Photoshop contributed to a Swiss style revival. Or the rise of Ibiza as a clubbing destination putting international travel into the minds of club art designers, or the fact that Helvetica was coincidentally a system font on Macs, or how the aesthetic changed as club music became harder and more electroclash-influenced. And to Tam and Collins&#039; credit, they do talk about things and they actually are interested in answering these questions. But there&#039;s comparatively little depth on CARI itself as the site&#039;s members have gatekept their stuff to a private Discord (desu I get why it&#039;s private; the gatekeeping is the issue). It doesn&#039;t help that their site layout makes these aesthetics look much more rigid and walled-off than they actually are.<br>I&#039;m grateful for what Tam, Collins et al have done, the latter especially for digitizing hundreds of design documents. But CARI feels like a missed opportunity, because this concept attracts a certain strain of autistic kid who was too young to have first hand experience of the aesthetics they&#039;re fascinated by, which combined with the general shallowness of CARI/the Aesthetics Wiki has resulted in a lot of them having bad, reductive takes (see: the synthwaveification of frutiger aero)<br>Sorry for the blogpost",

Diffuse vibes like &quot;Global Village Coffeehouse&quot; and &quot;Ultramodern Revival&quot; that had no leaders, origin or scene are presented alongside movements like Memphis or Superflat that did, while it pulverizes works together into slop by emphasizing The Aesthetic over their individual traits. A web of influences becomes a pile of water balloons, externally disconnected and internally homogeneous. It discourages designers from breaking the non-existent rules of the aesthetics and results in works that look like AIs trained on individual Aesthetics Wiki pages<br>B) Present aesthetics as the sum total of commercial design, even if most consumer art does not fall neatly into one (or any) of them. If aesthetics are your only lens for looking at design (again, it&#039;s not for CARI&#039;s founders but they&#039;re creating people for whom it is), you&#039;re going to miss shit like the works of Karim Rashid, who you can&#039;t tell the story of 2000s design without, but whose work approaches 4-5 CARI aesthetics without fully inhabiting any of them<br>&quot;avoid at all costs&quot; for CARI is too harsh, aestheticfaggotry just makes it too easy to develop bad habits if you&#039;re a designer. it can be fun if you&#039;re a layman because it&#039;ll open your eyes up more to the seemingly-throwaway art around you but if you&#039;re here you should be past that point<br><br><a href=\"#p459098\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;459098</a><br><br>It&#039;s to /gd/ what TV Tropes is to /tv/",

Though the handgun in the bottom right corner should be rotated 180 degrees so it faces the same way as the other guns. It looks really out of place flipped upside down. Having the guns all at least facing the same direction gives them a sense of stability and power which coincides with the direction that the bullets would be firing in. Like how a firing squad facing the same direction is powerful and purposeful; if they were pointing in random directions, they would look panicked and chaotic, not intentional and threatening",

For example I have doc/txt/psd/ai files for: calculating the upfront and flat rates/hourly/pricing per task and milestones, the questions you need to ask in the brief, digital contracts, deliverables list, research strategies for the company itself and the competition, mood boards, prompts (copywriting and ideation), proposals and presentations, brand kits and social media kits, invoices, mockups, automation actions/scripts for repetitive tasks, revisions and emails templates. All of that takes some time to do but is really worth it, and it will make you faster and more consistent.",

There are a lot of other factors involved. First, an optional, &quot;dense&quot; UI would mean double the work and double the code, practically speaking. Few want to invest in that and would rather try to make something everyone can use. Second, some of the problem lies in monitors stretching horizontally while web design patterns stretch vertically. This is partially because early designers came from print and then later because of phone scrolling (up/down is easier with one hand). Let&#039;s not get into monitor scaling issues. Lastly, most software developers work within the boundaries of UI toolkits for which there aren&#039;t that many. Those toolkits have preset widgets (buttons, fields, etc) and often can&#039;t be easily modified. Example: GTK.",

But I&#039;ve accepted drawing futa, trap, and loli, but I&#039;ve been feeling like drawing loli might be a arrow to the knee in my reputation, the worst part is that it was the most popular illustration i did by the amount of likes.<br><br>I know that it&#039;s fictional character and there are a lot of popular nsfw artists who just draw stuff like that on the side and just never get shit for it.

You can still be better if you continue to evolve as an artist and refine your craft, maybe even use AI in limited doses to get through some backgrounds etc. I wouldn&#039;t give up but there is a need to adapt to the new market. I think you should start with understanding your target customer base and work backwards. Personally I wouldn&#039;t be so eager that I jump into doing loli shit just to make a buck lol to turn this into a proper income you gotta take your time boy and get known.

Even if the concept is wild, ala Slenderman.<br>With the skills you have, I&#039;d start with imitating real document&#039;s and thinking about using graphic design as a way to make your story more believable. Like finding a bunch of files at an abandoned preschool. Or a bunch of graffiti leading into an underwound mecca. Bonus points if you do it live rather then CGI.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Story</span><br>This is the tough part, you have to take something extremely unbelievable (like the sun disappearing or a submarine with the memories of your wife) and make it into a real and tangible thing. So try to start with something completely bonkers and work backwards into how you can incorporate it in a realistic way. Minus points if you use existing folklore with no extra twists.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Puzzles</span><br>Managing puzzles can be really tough depending on your audience. If it&#039;s too easy it&#039;s boring, too tough and it becomes unsolvable. Hot tip. Start it as mind numbingly easy, then slowly crank up the difficulty. If it eventually becomes to hard, try a sock puppet reddit account that just so happened to figure it out. Then tone it back down for a while.<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t. an ARG fan since 2005</span>",

It sounds like the lesson here is that you maybe should have originally used a vector art tool rather than a raster art one. It&#039;s trivial to export a vector image as a bitmap, but the inverse is not easy. It&#039;s probably better if you redraw everything in Inkscape, as painful as that will be. I&#039;ve done a bunch of pixel art in Inkscape and it&#039;s a clumsy process but once you have a good workflow it&#039;s not too bad.",

Those are still the basic skills that make or break a decision when we need to hire someone new, 3D is similar to web in terms of exploding your job options and relatively few graphic designers commit the time to become good at either.

Where you have not &quot;coppied&quot; a single image but your collage is just multiple samples from the same source. So if all the samples of Colonel Cambel come from the same IP holder, anything chat GPT generates would be a &quot;copy&quot; or a &quot;collage&quot; which would be over the sample size.
