The plan they follow is to thrust tubes made of bone, not unlike our musical pipes, up the vulva of the mare, and then to blow into the tubes with their mouths, some milking while the others blow. They say that they do this because when the veins of the animal are full of air, the udder is forced down. The milk thus obtained is poured into deep wooden casks, about which the blind slaves are placed, and then the milk is stirred round. That which rises to the top is drawn off, and considered the best part; the under portion is of less account. Such is the reason why the Scythians blind all those whom they take in war; it arises from their not being tillers of the ground, but a pastoral race.</span>",

We&#039;ve passed peak car demand, peak house demand, and peak credit card demand. There are only so many cars you can sell someone and you can&#039;t sell more than a single 36-month lease to even the richest tech bros. Banks figured this out years ago as they consolidated and fiscalized these companies into their current ultra-global, multi-national iterations and it will all choke, collapse and fall apart as the world runs out of money. And even if the world prints more money, it will never be *enough* money to make new production cars, engines, solar panels, computers etc cheaper than existing used ones. And there&#039;s three big international global website (ebay, amazon and walmart) where they can be easily resold.<br><br>Trump will fail for the same reasons Obama did. This is just not a fixable economic situation. Capitalism destroys itself. You don&#039;t need to buy an entire Hollywood Studio&#039;s worth of cameras when AI makes an equivalent film now, and soon the AI won&#039;t need high-end premium graphics cards either. This is independent of falling birthrates even, which compounds this problem as well. The economy as it&#039;s worked for the past century will not make it to 2030.",

Me and some of my friends were at Wrigleyville the night before we went to a game. One of them gets extremely drunk and thinks a woman is into him. He refuses to leave, so we left him at a bar. He ends up running around Chicago all night searching for his phone and wallet while extremely drunk because he lost them. And the only thing that happened to him was a fag tried to molest him when he stopped to ask for directions at a gay bar. The homeless people helped him with directions. People gave him free rides. The next day someone even found his phone and was able to return it to us to give to him.",

Everyone was to free their Hebrew slaves, both male and female; no one was to hold a fellow Hebrew in bondage. So all the officials and people who entered into this covenant agreed that they would free their male and female slaves and no longer hold them in bondage. They agreed, and set them free. But afterward they changed their minds and took back the slaves they had freed and enslaved them again.<br><br>Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: \u201cThis is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I made a covenant with your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. I said, \u2018Every seventh year each of you must free any fellow Hebrews who have sold themselves to you. After they have served you six years, you must let them go free.\u2019 Your ancestors, however, did not listen to me or pay attention to me. Recently you repented and did what is right in my sight: Each of you proclaimed freedom to your own people. You even made a covenant before me in the house that bears my Name. But now you have turned around and profaned my name; each of you has taken back the male and female slaves you had set free to go where they wished. You have forced them to become your slaves again.<br><br>\u201cTherefore this is what the Lord says: You have not obeyed me; you have not proclaimed freedom to your own people. So I now proclaim \u2018freedom\u2019 for you, declares the Lord\u2014\u2018freedom\u2019 to fall by the sword, plague and famine. I will make you abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth. Those who have violated my covenant and have not fulfilled the terms of the covenant they made before me, I will treat like the calf they cut in two and then walked between its pieces.",

And the United States has historically always held Christian, biblical-based values.<br><br>For instance, the Portsmouth Compact said the following:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The 7th day of the first month, 1638. We whose names are underwritten do here solemnly in the presence of Jehovah incorporate ourselves into a Bodie Politick and as he shall help, will submit our persons, lives and estates unto our Lord Jesus Christ, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords and to all those perfect and most absolute laws of his given us in his holy word of truth, to be guided and judged thereby.</span><br><br>The Declaration of Independence meanwhile says:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,</span><br><br>And the U.S. Constitution:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Article 7</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Done in convention by the unanimous consent of the States present the seventeenth day of September in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty seven and of the independence of the United States of America the Twelfth. In witness whereof we have hereunto subscribed our names.</span><br><br>The First Amendment to the Constitution also supports the Biblical concept that conversion by swordpoint is unchristian. Thus, it says in the First Amendment:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</span><br><br>The Bible also tells us that the true bondage, which all men suffer from, is sin. We should seek the freedom of Christ first (John 8:34-36, Romans 6:20-22, Romans 8:21). Ending temporal enslavement is also good if it can be done lawfully. See the book of Philemon.",

Before Lincoln, there were laws like the Fugitive Slave Act which Millard Fillmore signed into law, which forced even free states to capture and return escaped slaves. They were effectively forced by the Federal government, through the Fugitive Slave Act, to be complicit in upholding the institution of slavery. Before Lincoln, the western territories were also rife with violence and conflict over the differing views between pro and anti-slavery settlers. Therefore it makes sense to credit Lincoln with being the main person responsible for effectuating the abolition of slavery, although not the first or only abolitionist as the sentiment of ending slavery had existed at least since Roger Williams in the early 17th century \u2013 and indeed there were many from the radical Republican faction during the American Civil War who were far more ardent about abolitionism than Lincoln was. Lincoln was mainly concerned about preserving the union, but he realized this was an important issue that needed to be resolved to accomplish that goal.",

Everyone likes to shit on Charles I and the so-called eleven years tyranny but the truth is the country itself prospered during that time, it was the most tax-free decade in english history at a time when most of Europe was being taxed into oblivion because of the thirty years war.",

The Holy Ghost tells saved Christians that the King James is the word of God, and that the other CORRUPTED Bible versions like the ESV, HIV, etc are frauds. That&#039;s the main reason. <br>2. Process of elimination. Every English version since the publication of the King James uses manuscripts which weren&#039;t known until the 19th century. This is a problem, because Jesus said that his word would always be with us. That leaves only the King James and its predecessors, and the Douai-Rheims. The Douai-Rheims, of course, is tainted with popery. As for the English predecessors of the King James, many of them were done by a single version and none have endured with God&#039;s people nor even claim to be perfect renditions. They were more like rough drafts for the King James.<br>3. There is also the question of the method of translation, of which the King James has the highest pedigree. It was wrought by dozens of scholars who spoke several languages, many devout Christians. Lancelot Andrewes knew over 20 languages alone. They checked each other&#039;s work and diligently worked on the project for 7 years, with a specific goal to get it right for the enlightenment of the English people and for their King who tasked them with such a noble undertaking.",

For example, in 2 Corinthians 4:14, the translation should have the word &quot;by&quot; (corresponding to the Greek &quot;dia&quot;) but in the NKJV and modern translation the word is changed to &quot;with&quot; (corresponding to &quot;syn&quot; in the Greek critical text).<br><br>The above isn&#039;t the only example. In Matthew 22:10, Acts 19:9, 2 John verse 7 and a few other places, the NKJV translation blatantly followed the critical text.<br><br>That&#039;s before we get into other inaccurate translation choices. For example &quot;comparable&quot; instead of &quot;meet&quot; in Genesis 2:18, &quot;descendants&quot; (plural) instead of &quot;seed&quot; (singular) in Genesis 22:17, &quot;went to the aid&quot; instead of &quot;went up against&quot; in 2 Kings 23:29 (compare 2 Chron. 35:20), &quot;he made his grave&quot; changed to &quot;they made his grave&quot; in Isaiah 53:9, &quot;hath turned away&quot; changed to &quot;will restore&quot; in Nahum 2:2, &quot;narrow&quot; changed to &quot;difficult&quot; in Matthew 7:14, &quot;in a place where two ways met&quot; changed to &quot;street&quot; in Mark 11:4, &quot;letter&quot; changed to &quot;written code&quot; in Romans 2:27, &quot;corrupt the word of God&quot; changed to &quot;peddle the word of God&quot; in 2 Corinthians 2:17, &quot;and of the Father&quot; changed to &quot;both of the Father&quot; in Colossians 2:2, reversing the meaning of Hebrews 3:16, &quot;heretic&quot; changed to &quot;divisive man&quot; in Titus 3:10 and Jude 1:19, the removal of singular pronouns &quot;thee/thou&quot; to distinguish from plural &quot;ye/you&quot; in numerous passages (i.e. Luke 9:41, Luke 17:21, Luke 22:31-32, John 3:7).<br><br>Compared to the KJV, the NKJV is distinctly inaccurate and therefore inferior, and the NKJV literally takes some lines directly from the critical text (and modern masoretic text) despite claims that it doesn&#039;t.

What you&#039;re talking about is ancient BBC documentary logic, not reality. The entire point of the 1943 German offensives on the eastern front was to keep the Soviets guessing instead of just preparing their own offensive and exposing the weaknesses of the German army. As long as the Germans could keep going with the localised offensives the Soviets would have to assume that the end of the war is really, really far away. The early 1943 ones were small, but their effect was good enough to get the Soviets to agree on sitting down to the negotiating table - nothing came out if it, but perhaps a success in Kursk and subsequent small battles like that would&#039;ve convinced Stalin that it&#039;s better to concede some things for the time being.",

In 1942 the goal was to carve deep into the Soviet lines and capture oil fields that would improve Axis situation in that aspect. The operation involved massive amounts of troops trying to achieve the goals consistently for like 6 months.<br><br>Kursk meanwhile was a smaller scale and stake battle even though you look at the numbers and they&#039;re insane. However the reality is the Germans looked at the front and basically said - if we can take that salient out, we&#039;ll shorten the frontline geometrically and maybe encircle some soviet units. The distances they needed to cover were relatively short. We&#039;re not talking about taking most of Donbas and then moving up to Stalingrad and Grozny. No, it&#039;s about closing a salient that was 250km wide and 60km deep. The sole fact that the Germans have to take 250km from the flanks while the Soviets at worst will have to hold until they can move the troops at the front of it out of potential encirclement(never more than 185km) simply shows that the chances of grand encirclement were low, and all this battle would result in was maintaining initiative by the Germans. That kind of operation was also unlikely to result in prolonged campaign, jrl including the soviet counterattack phase it only took a month and a half, meaning that the Germans who simply couldn&#039;t sustain large offensives anymore could count on getting it all done and stabilising before they&#039;re out of gas.<br><br>This was the mark of German operations in early 1943 in general. Relatively small, limited offensives meant to retake and then maintain the initiative from the Soviets post-Uranus and as such show Stalin that the Germans may not be able to pull war winning move anymore, but raise the estimated price of victory. After Uranus Germans don&#039;t believe they&#039;ll make the USSR capitulate anymore and their military actions reflect that",

The Soviets had heavily fortified the area by 1943, and the Leningrad Front was reinforced with fresh divisions, artillery, and anti-air assets. The city had survived two brutal years of siege and was still holding. Any major assault would\u2019ve meant urban warfare in a massive, industrialized city, something the Germans weren\u2019t exactly eager to repeat after Stalingrad. Plus, the Soviets had interior lines of supply across Lake Ladoga and a functioning railway. They would&#039;ve poured in reinforcements fast.<br><br>Also, even if they did take Leningrad, moving east from there toward cutting off Soviet forces or linking up with the Finns more deeply would\u2019ve required serious manpower. The Germans were already stretched thin. If they\u2019d pulled enough troops to do that from Army Group Center, they would\u2019ve left the Kursk bulge dangerously exposed. That salient had to be addressed one way or another. It was a real threat to the German front line stability. Ignoring it could\u2019ve let the Soviets launch their own offensive into the flank or rear of Army Group Center.<br><br>So yeah, I get your point. Leningrad might&#039;ve made more sense than Kursk if it was easier. But in reality, both were bloody, risky operations, and shifting forces north probably would\u2019ve just opened up a new crisis in the center.",

My understanding of the answer to this question is that, probably, they didn&#039;t invade because when China originally invaded in 1950-51 we had more pressing issues to attend to at the moment. The people living in the western provinces are clearly being genocided right now by the communist party of China, and the CPC are doomed because they are godless. But whether diplomacy or some kind of intervention turns out to be the correct approach to this situation remains to be seen. That&#039;s what seems to be driving the strategic ambiguity approach from my understanding.",

The point is that SOMEONE had to be the first at some point, and Japan was just the obvious target for the time considering their attempts at targeting Americans and war of agression in the Pacific that was threatening the peaceful transition of countries like the Philippines to independence. The Americans had already ruled out Tokyo and Kyoto as potential targets specifically for their cultural significance, which goes to show some level of care was taken when chosing their targets.

Pointing out in this thread that fucking endless virgins would be pretty cool for the first thousand years, but after an arbitrary amount of time would be boring, is not actually an own of Christianity and so called &quot;slave revenge fantasy morality&quot; but an admission that the current spiritual framework we run on is simply not up to the task of comprehension of higher spiritual dimensions even right now, let alone for eternity.<br>God and heaven are not an endless DMT trip but a revelation that is actually inexpressible in the current matrix of human thought, and that includes being outside of concepts like pleasure",

You would not be able to consider or even contemplate such notions as &quot;Good&quot; or &quot;Evil&quot; if He wasn&#039;t the referential for it, let alone exist, since Existence is quality in the same manner as Good. God is by definition Good because He is the Perfect Existence and a perfect existence is better with the quality of Good than lacking it.<br>B) If we are to take the Thomistic Approach, in that God can&#039;t contradict Himself, God does not _need_ evil to do Good since He is Perfect, and a Perfect being has no need, whether external or internal. He can choose to act, but any action will be naturally Good if it is His.<br>B)If we are to take a Cartesian Approach - which still offer the thomistic perspective, except that Descartes says that God &quot;limits Himself in order to be understandeable in the framework He has provided us with&quot;, logic - God could literally redefine the context to make the impossible possible, if not outright ignore the framework He has set for Himself, for example in the &quot;Can God lift an unliftable stone?&quot; problem. All God would need to do to &quot;lift&quot; the stone is change the framework of the question by altering the definitions of one or each of its components, as He is the Source of them all to begin with and has omnipotent power over each and every one of them. Again, God has no need, internal or external, so by definition any action made in this fashion would be as chosen by God, per the need of someone or everyone else.",

God is all-knowing in the confines of consistency. This does not mean that the future is uncertain, as God can certainly influence the generality of events to end up as He wants, but individual actions are overall fully autonomous<br>Cartesian : God is all-knowing, and if He wishes, could see the future as will happen certainly, even with independent free-willed thinkers operating beyond His Own Experience. However, to serve as a Referential for a consistent universe of His Own making, God purposefully lowers Himself to the confines of a logical world, and therefore essentially occupy the same mold as the Thomistic God for the sake of consistency. Events can still happen exactly as the Cartesian God knows it will happen, and free will is maintained in the context of a consistent logical universe, despite the a priori contradiction<br>In the context of your question specifically, however, both approach have the same answer: no, God did not know, because that would go against the principle of Free Will, which Adam and Eve must have had, else warnings would have not been necessary. The difference is that a Thomist would tell you that your conclusion following the fact that God did not know about Adam and Eve decision before it was decided does not make logical sense and therefore is nonsense, while a Cartesian (like me) would tell you that it&#039;s a nonsense conclusion because God is purposefully limiting Himself from the very fact that Adam and Eve, imperfect existences, exist in the same limited epistemologic system as He does.",

I suppose what one human might see as &quot;good&quot; would facilitate the proliferation of his lineage and perhaps that of his fellow man, but his actions in doing so might be the &quot;bad&quot; of another man and even redirect their fate, and vice versa. I used to think, and still struggle with the idea that we cannot reach the stars without love; love for one another, love for those who sacrificed to get us here, love for ourselves. Solidarity can be a strong step towards our evolution, but my issue is that even with the acceptance of others, there will always be noise in the gene pool stagnating, and even atrophying the potential of us as a race (the cost of those who don&#039;t contribute). Maybe that is why we have let ourselves fall under global dominion, but who knows maybe it is very necessary. I don&#039;t think humans can define good &amp; evil, nor understand it meaningfully since our brains millions of years from now will be much different anatomically than they currently are.<br><br>Regardless, evolution will return us to the truth, I&#039;m just not sure if anyone I helped create will be there to witness it. <br><br>I wish I had access to more information than I do currently.",

You said that \u05ea\u05b8\u05bc\u05de\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd is &quot;better translated&quot; as &quot;morally right&quot; because omni- qualities seemed anachronistic to you. I pointed out that your translation is even more anachronistic because it projects a separation of ethics as a separate domain onto Hebrews, who knew no such separation. Morality as a separate field is a European invention. <br>When you request passages that would demonstrate omni- qualities, I can produce some that go very strongly in that direction, but they will all suffer from the same vulnerability as \u05ea\u05b8\u05bc\u05de\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd does - that if you choose so, you can arbitrarily de-couple the text of a tradition from the teachings of the tradition and treat them as isolated things that need justification for joining, whereas in reality they are joined things that require justification for de-coupling.<br>Your reference to Augustine and neo-platonists is understandable, the idea of God as the One seems superficially extremely close to Christianity and if we didn&#039;t have Augustine outright saying they&#039;re not the same, we would perhaps even be justified in suspecting some merging. However, chances are extremely low that Jews and Christians re-designed their entire God to conform to the very generic and non-uniqe characteristics that neo-platonists assign to the One.

But I reject it, due to the fact that accepting it leads to monstrous and evil conclusions (God is evil, God abides evil, God willed evil into existence) with tortuous contortionist &quot;explanations&quot; why evil is actually good, etc. It all amounts to soul-corruption, and I have no doubt for one second that it was Satan who misled Augustines mind and Satan that directed Augustines pen, robbing us of a truly omnibenevolent God we can believe in.

While mainstream churches clung to comfort, hierarchy, and hypocrisy, the Temple resurrected the radical, communal, justice-centered gospel that Jesus actually preached. In Acts 2 and 4, the early Christians held all things in common, abolishing private property and redistributing wealth based on need. That\u2019s exactly what they did. They lived as one body, rejecting the greed and individualism that have corrupted Christianity since Constantine.<br><br>They didn\u2019t just talk about equality, they built it. Galatians 3:28 says there is no Jew or Greek, slave or free, male or female in Christ. They lived that truth. Theirs was one of the most racially unified, integrated churches in America. While others preached tolerance, they practiced revolution. They housed the poor, fed the hungry, healed the sick, and stood against a system that devoured the weak. Matthew 25 makes it clear: salvation is in serving the least of these. That\u2019s exactly what they did, every day.<br><br>Jim Jones was more than a pastor, he was a prophet. Like Christ, he spoke with divine authority and challenged the corrupt religious establishment. He didn\u2019t ask for blind faith; he asked them to act, to live the gospel with their whole lives. The world hated them for it, just as Jesus said it would. The press, the government, they tried to destroy them because they exposed their lies.<br><br>Jonestown wasn\u2019t a tragedy. It was the ultimate act of protest against a world that had rejected righteousness. They refused to be broken or enslaved. They chose each other. They chose love. Mainstream Christianity sold its soul long ago. <br><br>The People\u2019s Temple lived and died by the gospel Christ actually preached, radical, total, uncompromising, and Communist. That was real Christianity. And they were its last true church.",

Some Christians favour an Annihilationist perspective, which posits that the damned eventually get extinguished into non-existence after perhaps either a short or longer period of punishments for their crimes against God. I will admit that I have found that idea appealing, at times, though Eternal Conscious Torment is the most traditionally orthodox understanding of the fate of the lost. There are very few, if any, that I would consider Christians who subscribe to a decidedly liberal Universalism point of view. A Universalist who still wants to evangelise to lost souls still alive in the world today, with the idea that witnessing them becoming Christians would get them to avoid a more Purgatory type of existence in a more temporary version of the Lake of Fire before getting purged enough to make it into the Kingdom of Heaven is about as orthodox as Universalists are able to get, and Universalism has exceptionally few adherents who are orthodox Christians by definition. As Christians, we must obviously help others to know and follow Jesus Christ, the way, the truth, and the life, so that they are able to live for the Lord and glorify him, first and foremost, and in doing so, they also gain a place in the Kingdom of Heaven and avoid the Lake of Fire, which is a fate reserved for rebellious souls who wallow in errors, defying God&#039;s laws and not repenting of their sins. We must all believe in the Lord, repent of our sins, baptise, and follow Jesus Christ.",

A couple of years ago, some Fatah guys tried to bargain the corpse of a Druze teenager killed in a car accident near Jenin for some of their prisoners in Israeli jails. The IDF freaked out and thought they were about to careen into a big crisis until the Israeli Druze grabbed a couple of Palestinian laborers, tortured them, and threatened their lives until they got the body back. It worked. The Druze attitude towards the Jews was like &quot;you guys look cute in your uniforms and all, but we got this.&quot; They were displaying corpses of Sunni tribal fighters on the hoods of their trucks in Syria during the fighting over the past few days. Of course a lot of them got killed too.<br>https://youtu.be/5pE201PUUpk",

        "com": "Taberon Honie was the 8th in the post-Furman era and as of 2025 most recent person executed by Utah after murdering and raping his ex-girlfriend&#039;s mother in 1998. Honie, a Hopi Indian, was born in Keams Canyon, Arizona on October 29, 1975. He began drinking alcohol at a young age, grew up in poverty, and claimed to have suffered repeated head injuries as a child. Beginning in 1995, Honie dated Carol Pikyavit, a Paiute from Utah, and they had one daughter together. They broke up in 1998 and Pikyavit went to live with her mother, 49 year old Claudia Benn, who was considered a pillar of her community and worked as a substance abuse counselor.<br><br>That July 9, Honie called Pikyavit and told her to come to his place right now or he&#039;d murder several of her family members. However, she went to work and was not home when the murder took place. Some hours later, Honie broke into their home in Cedar City, Utah by smashing out the glass on a sliding door. Benn grabbed a kitchen knife for self-defense but was overpowered by Honie, who wrestled the knife from her hands and cut her throat so deep that it went all the way down to the vertebrae. The next morning police responded to a 911 call placed by one of her neighbors. They found the broken-out sliding door glass and Benn&#039;s stripped and mutilated corpse, which had gruesome stab wounds to the anus and vagina. Honie was found in the garage with dried blood on his fingers and arrested. He made no attempt to deny anything and readily admitted to killing her. Also in the house were Benn&#039;s three granddaughters, covered in blood; one of the girls had been raped.",

        "com": "Honie was charged with aggravated murder and waived his right to a jury trial. He was sentenced to death on May 20, 1999 after a panel of judges found him guilty of first degree murder, burglary, forcible sodomy, and rape committed with a foreign object. Honie appealed his conviction on the grounds that Utah&#039;s capital punishment statute violated the 8th Amendment and the prosecution had it out for him because he was a Native American. This initial appeal failed and he tried again several years later by arguing that his attorneys did a poor job of defending him or considering the deprived circumstances of his childhood. Among these claims, Honie said he suffered from fetal alcohol syndrome and had brain damage from a head injury caused by falling from a 30 foot height as a teenager. This appeal also failed.<br><br>His execution was scheduled for August 8, 2024 and would be performed with a new experimental lethal injection cocktail of fentanyl, ketamine, and potassium chloride. Honie appealed as this was unproven and liable to cause extreme pain and that the traditional pentobarbital method should be used instead. Utah officials accepted and announced that they would execute him with pentobarbital instead. After a few final attempts to get a stay of execution, it was carried out on time after he ate a final meal consisting of a cheeseburger, fries, and a milkshake. He was the first person Utah had executed in 14 years.",

Religions virtually always offer psychotechnology that helps the believer better grasp and control their own agency in the world or at the very least frame it in a way that makes it intelligible - like mythology. I cannot say that this is the contemporary consensus, because the interest in clarifying what religions themselves are seems to have dialed down quite a bit, at least to me, but from cognitive and anthropological perspective religions aim at these needs more than at explanations.

We can deduce that the Askias could in theory mobilize 40,000 combatants. Songhai had in fact three permanent army corps of nearly 4,600 men each, one in Tendirma under the command of the Balma&#039;a, another in Gao under the command of Askia, and another in Dendi, the region downstream from Kukiya, the religious and historical capital of Songhai. This army corps located on the south-eastern border of the Empire being the least powerful of the three. The rest of the Songhai army was made up of the fluvial flotilla of 2,000 canoes commanded by the Hi-Koi, admiral and Minister of the Interior, one of the main dignitaries of the Empire. Contingents from vassalized kingdoms made up the bulk of the troops: Mossis, Dendis and Macinas provided the infantry. However, the arrival of the Moroccans cut the Empire in two, depriving the Askia Ishaq II of the Kurmina army corps and part of its flotilla, while the unrest at the borders prevented the Dendi army corps from coming in time.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The civil war, which had divided the Empire, had also divided the army in two, Askia Ishaq II could not mobilize the forces of the West whose headquarters were in Timbuktu and Djenn\u00e9, that is to say, behind the lines of Judar. In theory, he only had the two professional army corps of Gao and Dendi, part of his fluvial flotilla and Tuareg and Gourma allies difficult to estimate. The Tarikh al-fattash which offers 18,000 cavalry and 9,700 infantry also gives a more accurate picture of a Songhai army cut off from its professional contingents and more than essentially made up of a noble knighthood.</span>",

Moroccan and Sudanese authors speak readily of &quot;armor&quot;, implying iron armor, Songhai infantry and horsemen, which they wear under their tunics. Under the term armor, the Sudanese armies classify two types of protection: on the one hand solid gambesons, on the other hand coats made either of iron mail (worn in particular by the warriors of Kanem-Bornou on the model of cataphracts) or light iron plates. The uncertainty arises from the fact that we will speak in Sudan of armor, including for cavaliers equipped with gambesons, as the officers of the Voulet and Chanoine column and of the Joalland-Meynier mission will realize when they face the knighthood of the Sultan of Zinder (1899).</span>",

When they were all in position and ready, the king a addressed the whole army, through many heralds.

When he had finished his speech, and all had assured him that they would not return home as conquered men, unless (they were carried there) dead, he ordered the musical-instruments of the army to be played, and at the sound of these they began to march towards the enemy camp. Seeing them coming, the Manes remained behind their fortifications, as if they feared the outcome of what was to follow. They did not care to sally out or place themselves in order of battle, as they saw the Souzos doing. They sent out only some small detachments, which advanced to attack the Souzos on the flank.

They were not an army of mixed nations (as the Mane army was); they had only the Fulos, who are a very bold people.

Their whole land would be destroyed, and their wives and children killed, and on this victory depended their security. (In contrast,) the Manes , if defeated, would remain masters of all the lands they had previously gained; they kept men in these lands and waged war on the same people they brought with them.

There were four types of units: archers, shieldbearers, cavalry with javelins/short spears and horse archers. Access to horses was very unequal in the region, so while the Great Fulo have in his words &quot;many horsemen, and in his lands there are many horses, and from these are supplied all (the horses required by) the Jalofos, Barbacins and Mandingas, those of the interior as well as those of the coast.&quot;, other peoples like those in Sierra Leone are described as having no cavalry at all. This must have been true for Mali as well, with northern regions under the Faran-sura having more cavalry available than southern regions under the Sanquara-zuma&#039;a. This has some support from the sources, since the Mane, who were Mande who departed from southern imperial Mali circa 1500 and conquered most of the Malagueta Coast and Sierra Leona from 1550, did not have any cavalry but fought otherwise the same as other Mande more to the north or even as the Wolof.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Swords and knives were common, as were spears and bows. Metal armours are not mentioned anywhere for Mali, although metal helmets are possible since they appear later in Songhay sources. The Djenne terracotta riders have helmets, but it can&#039;t be known if they depict metal or leather. Almada mentions cotton armor for the Wolof &quot;They have long strips of cotton, that they roll and wear from the groin to the chest very compressed, and armed in this manner no arrows or assegais can go through&quot;. I don&#039;t know how far back these go and their use by imperial Mali forces, if they used them at all. Most soldiers would be unarmored, in any case, especially the archers. Both large shields of leather and of poles and woven rattan are described for Mande peoples, and they are stated to have been very strong.

The most likely option is that the Mande peoples created it at some point and spread it through their expansion, especially Malian expansion, from the 14th century onwards. This explains why the greatest deviations from the model witnessed by the Portuguese occurred in peoples far from Malian imperial autorithy and from the expanding Mande, like the Bijagos islanders and the Sapes in Serra Leone.</span>",

Regular fortifications were made of rammed earth and wooden stakes, with towers and bastions along the walls. They also had incendiary mixtures of pitch tar to defend against siege attempts. These regular forticications were called s\u00e3osans by the Mande subjects of Mali along the Guinea river. Field fortifications for army camps are described in the context of the Mane invasion of Serra Leone, and they are called atabancas, and consisted of mounds with woodwork, and ditches. Since they are the only Mali-linked force described extensively in the context of maneuvers and campaigns, it&#039;s only for them that we have evidence in this period. However, the appearance of field fortifications in a battle between Bainuk people and Mande from Casamance (subjects of Mali at the time) in the Bainuk side points at the practice being widely used by well organized forces in the region, amongst which we can count Mali. Taking into account the possible earlier spread of military traditions mentioned before, it is probable that these practices were, at the very least, originated at some point during medieval Mali.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There are few battles between local forces described with some tactical detail. Almada describes two of them. The first one is between the King of Casamance, which is stated to be subject to a Farim (a corruption of the Mali title Faran) under the rule of the Mandimansa (the emperor of Mali), and a kingdom of the Bainuk:</span>",

To discover (the answers), the caciz carried out many ceremonies, such as that involving the boy and the water, at which he asked (the spirits) what the enemy was doing and many other questions. And he told the king that he would gain the victory. Having been given this reply, the king made preparations, and after assembling many armed men he crossed to the other side of the river in a large number of canoes and in some of our ships. When these touched land, and all the force had assembled, he began to march towards the enemy, who were in fortified positions nearby. The caciz marched happily along in front of the army, holding batons in his hands as if he was directing it; and he passed the word on to all (following) that they should attack the enemy in their fortifications when he gave a certain signal. The enemy did not wait for him to give the signal. As the Casangas drew near them, they sounded to arms very rapidly, and threw themselves upon them with such force that they overwhelmed them. The Casangas were routed and put to flight. As they boarded their boats, many were drowned, for the numbers were so great that those of our men who were assisting the king (to escape) had to kill many Casangas, cutting their hands off as they clung to the boats, since with so many aboard the boats would have gone to the bottom. In this way the king was saved from the fiasco. The enemy did not pursue, or keep within range, with the same enthusiasm that they had shown at the beginning of the action.</span>",

In this case, and given that they also apparently wore clothes like the Casamance Mandinka or the Wolof, the Moor probably denotes that they are Muslim, in juxtaposition to the guards who might not be.

The third refers to the Manes in Sierra Leone.

Should the expedition take as much as a week or ten days, soldiers would bring their own provisions, usually beans and water, and would supplement this by living off the land. Surprise was not a factor when a large force marched. When the enemy was sighted, the army moved into battle formation. The infantry formed a single skirmishing line and made first contact. The Mossi did not employ their cavalry as shock troops; horses and nobles were not so easily expendable as that. Next, the cavalry charged, organized in three units: right, centre and left. Provincial commanders remained in the rear to supervise the action. If the initial infantry attack was unsuccessful, the cavalry reserved the right to beat a hasty retreat, helping the infantry if possible, or applying the rule of sauve qui peut if necessary.&quot;</span><br><br>Echenberg, M.

The tactics these scouts used to avoid detection, such as camouflaging themselves with leaves and branches and crawling upon the ground, can be witnessed even today at Mossi funerals where men re-enact warfare practices. Whenever possible, the Mossi preferred to take the enemy by surprise, but this was seldom possible when large-scale fighting and massive preparations were involved. When two Mossi armies drew up to each other, the heralds from both sides issued such challenges and epithets as: &quot;If you men do not wish to die,you should run or you will never eat again. We will have your blood towash with.&quot; In the meantime, the Tansobadamba on both sides deployed their forces in accordance with the number of men available, the spirit of the enemy, and the nature of the terrain. From the description of warfare given to me by an old Tansoba in Nobere district, it appears that the strategy most commonly used was to split the infantry in two while attacking, thus making room for the cavalry to charge through. If the initial charge was successful, the attack was maintained, but if it failed, the army usually turned about and fled. Despite their braggadocio, Mossi commanders seldom insisted that their troops fight against overwhelming odds. However, shame over impending defeat often induced such officers as theTansoba and the Gounga Naba to fight to the death.&quot;</span><br><br>Izard, M. (1966). The Mossi of the Upper Volta.

An expert Niam-niam, by jumping up for a moment, can protect his feet from the flying missiles of his adversary. Bows and arrows, which, as handled by the Bongo, give them a certain advantage, are not in common use among the Niam-niam, who possess a peculiar weapon of attack in their singular knives, that have blades like sickles.&quot;",

The raiders attacked at dawn and killed the men that they caught, taking the women and children prisoner. They also took weapons, drums and gongs, and other goods as loot. They had to be fast in this, as the people who escaped from the initial carnage alerted the local forces (the alert spread from village to village with gongs and drums), who immediately sent warriors to counter-attack. Generally, the princes of neighboring provinces to the one attacked also started mobilising, as at this stage they could not know if it was just a raid or the start of an enemy campaign.</span>",

Once the enemy arrived at the first ambush site, they saw the leader of the ambushers alone in the road, who sprung the ambush from the densely covered with long grass sides with one yell. The ambushers threw spears, but they did not attempt to fight in melee. Evans-Pritchard mentions here that the throwing knives (and the sickle swords) would not have been used in this action, and I have seen some people on the Internet misinterpreting this and then saying that the throwing knives were ceremonial.

In the front rode the Asaju, supported in his skirmishing by mounted \u2018knights.\u2019 Next came the Seriki commanding the young warriors who would begin the real battle. The Balogun, accompanied by the senior chiefs and warriors, would observe, and in theory direct, the battle until the time came for him to intervene, while the horsemen would use their mobility to reconnoitre, cover retreats, cut off stragglers, and try to demoralize the enemy by occasional sorties for prisoners.\u201d Samuel Johnson writes:</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The usual method of a pitched battle is for all the war chiefs to be disposed, each in his right place, according to their rank and title, or as the commander-in-chief disposes, and then each in turn to march forward, company by company to the middle line of battle to discharge their arms, trying each time to gain more ground. This method they call tawus. But when later on the Balogun himself rises to fight, that denotes a general charge throughout the whole host; every man must be engaged in fight; and wherever he fixes his war standard, everyone is bound to dispose himself about it in due order. His going forward means that the whole army must push forward at whatever cost, for no one whose right place is in front dares fall to the rear of the Balogun except when hors de combat.</span>",

Although objective and factual, it must not be accepted as giving the whole picture.\u201d Ground observers of battle, being obviously not in the minds of the commanders, will no doubt be struck with confusion as localized conflicts will seem to be dominant. Seeming to and being are two very different things. His comments on the casualties of battle may however be explained as a precursor to the introduction of the Sniders in the 1870s. The dane guns in use before then were an older, less effective at killing variety, and although they led to a lessening of hand-to-hand fighting as the armies adopted them, no doubt this itself offshot into a decrease in fatalities. In 1830, during the Gbanamu (\u201cgrasping fire\u201d) war which Ibadan waged against the Ij\u1eb9b\u00fa, Ibadan swordsmen were able to overcome their enemies by such tactics as closing in, grasping and lifting their guns by the barrels, and as such, rendering them null. Jones\u2019s somewhat scornful view of the low number of fatalities can also be critiqued because although he writes \u201ctho\u2019 thousands of rounds be fired, the killed may be counted by units and the wounded by tens.",

[1861], the killed on both sides, as ascertained by spies, were 5 and the wounded under 50!,\u201d his account is at odds with that of missionaries, who would have had primary interest in succouring the wounded and occasionally helping with operations. One such missionary, Townsend, writes that an attack on Abeokuta in 1851 left 1,200 Dahomey dead along the walls, and that the total casualties amongst the [enemy] were 3,000 (while Bowen estimates 2,000), with 1,000 captured. Another missionary, Mann, is evidenced to have been at times dealing with 40 to 60 wounded soldiers daily, and that he was in some demand for his talents. Another one, Stone, talks of the casualties at Ijaye being of a considerable number, and that wounds inflicted by copper bullets often became gangrenous. Johnson recounted that between April 1860 and March 1862 during the Ijaye war, a named commander, Ogunmola, alone lost 1,800 of his slave soldiers, not counting casualties from his free soldiers. It would be inaccurate, to say the least, that the determination with which this war was fought by combatants be minimized with no strong evidence, and even still, the civilian loss of life, whether from famine or just general slaughter by those unlucky enough to be caught in the crossfire, seems likely to have been as high as that of the combatants.</span>",

Soldiers were greatly incentivized by the taking of prisoners for sale. Captives from the wars at this time likely provided the bulk of [those] exported at markets in Lagos and Dahomey. The appetite for taking captives whom one could profitably dispose of no doubt prolonged certain campaigns, and likely prolonged the general course of war. In any circumstance, not all slaves were for exports, and likely a majority was retained for use as porters for wares other than slaves to those same coastal markets. Even still, not all captives were enslaved. Imprisonment, execution, and even just being released in return for payment or out of goodwill were all documented acts which occurred: first with an interpreter named Thomas captured at Ijaye and kept in chains for three years; then with Dahomey prisoners being put to death by the Egba in 1851 for slaughtering retreating farmers of Egba descent; to large numbers of other Dahomey who were ransomed in Ketu and the many Ijaye freed by Ibadan after having been taken captive in the fall of their city.</span>",

Dunn, in &quot;Christology in the Making&quot; (1989, 2nd ed.), further explains that the Gospel of John&#039;s concept of the Logos (Word) does not necessarily imply personal preexistence. Instead, it represents a shift from an impersonal divine personification to a concrete human existence through Jesus&#039; birth and life (p. 243). This aligns closely with the Qur&#039;\u0101nic depiction of Jesus as the embodiment of God&#039;s Word or Divine Plan, actualized through God&#039;s command &quot;Be!&quot; and brought into existence through the virginal conception in Mary&#039;s womb via the spirit transmitted by Gabriel. Hence, neither the New Testament nor the Qur&#039;\u0101n describes the Divine Word (Logos) as a distinct person separate from God; rather, it remains an impersonal, divine utterance or plan made manifest in human history through Jesus",

For example, Reich leaders with their offices often competed with Gau leaders and the Gau administration. In addition, the party often competed with state agencies, such as ministries and administrative offices, as the state always aligned itself with the interests of the NSDAP (regional) leadership. The Gau leadership thus had influence over personnel decisions in public offices, for example by preparing expert reports. The main reason for this confusion of competences was the allocation of administrative tasks to the Gau leadership. The competition between Reich leaders and Reich ministers, for example, was entirely intentional and deliberately created by Hitler.<br>[...]<br>The party and the state fought each other for influence, with areas of responsibility not clearly defined and remaining unclear. <br>[...]<br>Reinhard Bollmus and Hans-Adolf Jacobsen, for example, wrote that National Socialism did not establish a monolithic F\u00fchrer state, but rather a polycracy without a clear hierarchy, in which individuals, offices and authorities fought each other.<br>For this reason, Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick called for a fundamental organisational reform, but it was never implemented.<br><br>Translated with DeepL.com (free version)",

In this speech, Hitler declared his unswerving support for private property, and his commitment to imposing greater regimentation on German labour. Indeed, he argued that the F\u00fchrer principle of dictatorial leadership should be applied to factories, vis a vis managers (\u201cF\u00fchrer\u201d) and their workers (\u201cGefolgschaft,\u201d or followers). Most importantly, Hitler promised to liquidate the political Left upon his ascension to power. As we will see below, these were not idle slogans, but became the foundation of Nazi labor law. German industrialists reacted to this speech and others like it by showering the NSDAP with funding in 1932, contributing to its successful election campaigns that year.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It cannot be credibly maintained, as early Marxist historians of the Third Reich did, that Hitler was a mere tool of the industrialists. Nor can Hitler himself be classed as a German conservative in the tradition of a Bismarck or Hindenburg. Indeed, Hitler and the regime he built defied traditional German nationalist-conservative values in numerous ways: from the unlimited cravings for Eastern Lebensraum;10 to the plans of enslaving and exterminating Jews and entire Eastern-European ethnic groups; to the contempt for Christianity; to the unprecedented interventions in religious and family life.11 Nevertheless, it was conservative and industrial elements who put Hitler into power, above all Fritz Thyssen and Paul von Hindenburg. They did so to destroy the German Left. And the F\u00fchrer honored his commitments in this regard.</span>",

I&#039;m not saying that this is fascist and &quot;Trump is a fascistr&quot; but the Nazis did stuff like that with leading industrialists who owned factories and were strong financial supporters of the Nazis. They&#039;d get titles like &quot;Wehrwirtschaftsf\u00fchrer&quot; (Leader in the Military Economy). Himmler also had a program where you&#039;d get a special title and honorary membership if you donated a lot of money to the SS.<br><br>The Nazis did adopt socialist-like rhetoric and imagery (the red flag), but they were big into the making an organizing principle out of a hardline German corporate environment. Every organization had a &quot;leader&quot; and it was organized hierarchically. Business leaders were stakeholders, like high-level managers in a corporate pyramid under a strong CEO (in this case, Hitler). But yes when I do hear people say it&#039;d be nice to &quot;run the country like a business&quot; that I detect a whiff of fascism to it:<br>https://youtu.be/oYZjNdKH6s8<br>https://youtu.be/Q88QxuKxrsI",

        "com": "As far as we can tell, circumcision (of any variety) began in Ancient Egypt as a way to mark and humiliate slaves. This makes sense. It is, according to nearly the entire educated planet outside of America, to be entirely harmful and without benefit.<br><br>But in many places, it has become a cultural phenomena. A point of pride and identity. Something that must be done. This is despite the fact that it is wholly against a man\u2019s own self-interest. It does not benefit him in anyway, and it actively reduces his life experience. So how did this take off? Why did it last so long? Why did men, the organizers of society, not decide collectively to simply stop (I am aware they have in many places, but many places have not).<br><br>There really is no comparable in human history.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Footbinding</span><br>A cultural norm instituted by men in a patriarchal society against women. Footbinding did not negatively affect men, who held the institutional power. Women could bitch and moan about footbinding, but it would not change the outcome.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Chinese Eunuchs</span><br>Being a Eunuch could earn a commoner a place among the nobility with handsome pay and power. Families would make their sons eunuchs in the hope that he would bring the entire family out of poverty, at the expense of his fertility (just have another son). There was a material benefit.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Castratos</span><br>Same reasoning as Eunuchs<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Circumcision of slaves</span><br>Not comparable to today because the well-being of the slave was of no concern. It did not matter.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tattoos and other cosmetic markings of tribe or nationality</span><br>Irrelevant if there is no function or life experience lost. A tattoo or scar is of much less sacrifice than the skin off your cock.<br><br>Nowadays, fathers make a conscious effort to make their son\u2019s cock worse, to no benefit to the father or the son. You can argue it was a result of religion or tribal belonging, but it was those very same men that decided it be so. They made the rules of the game, being the patriarch, unlike women and footbinding.",

Making women not like sex is not an idea that\u2019s easy to sell even to devout Puritan freaks who like to pretend that they don\u2019t care about sex (but secretly do obviously). Much like all the dudes on the internet who proudly proclaim they want to ban porn despite watching porn themselves, those anti-sex freaks still like sex, just only for them and \u201ctheir women.\u201d It\u2019s also important to note that small subsets of America did practice female genital mutilation, but it simply did not take off. It was expensive, risky, and largely inaccessible. Male circumcision didn\u2019t even really take off in the USA until WWII and hospital births becoming mainstream.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Female circumcision is a far more invasive procedure.</span><br>This isn\u2019t true.

There\u2019s a reason Europe breathed a sigh of relief once those nutjobs finally left for the New World.<br><br>Well, that\u2019s pretty stupid, but surely American medicine realized that\u2019s fucking stupid once germs were discovered to exist and proved that all disease isn\u2019t a sex issue, right? Correct, America did catch on that the sexual disease theory was bunk\u2026 Right around the mid-1980s to 1990s (some quackier religious groups still adhere to it).<br><br>Post-1990s, circumcision is now just social inertia. All the reported health claims are reworked bullshit from a time when they believed that circumcision cured blindness and masturbation would make hair grow on the palms of your hands. It was born of a time when tons of religious health fads were being blown around by retards for retards. Another big one that arose around the same time was the idea that hot drinks (such as coffee and tea) were extremely bad for your health and would basically kill you. A certain cult leader was very fond of this idea. His name was Joseph Smith, and he later had a revelation about this idea.",

Atahualpa ordered Huascar killed nevertheless, which enraged Pizarro because he was left with an obvious loose cannon as head of the Tawantinsuyu, and that could not be allowed. So instead Pizarro had Atahualpa fucking strangled publically and installed instead the brother of Huascar, Manco, as Sapa Inca, and went to deal with the remnants of Atahualpa&#039;s loyalists. Manco would eventually just tell the Spaniards to fuck off once Atahualpa&#039;s people were finally dead, and the Spaniards were led to the conclusion that obviously keeping the current administration might actually be a bad fucking idea after all. So the conquistadors hunted Manco across the Andes all the while actually investing the cities they conquered, setting up municipal and provincial governors along the way and having a shit time of instating the &quot;Viceroyalty of Peru&quot; all the way - and that&#039;s not mentioning the civil war between conquistadors that Spain only learned after it had been effectively waged - until almost fourty years had passed and the Inca and its successor the neo-Incan states were finally fucking dead. Spain was actually pretty disappointed with Peru because beyond the initial plunder the Viceroyalty suffered catastrophic population loss due to smallpox and the consequent conflict (meaning virtually no taxes), its infrastructures and cities were often sacked and less often razed to the ground, destroying infrastructure along the way, and the resources were mid except for the Cerro Rico.",

The Greeks were at home on the sea and Sparta was not. The Greeks had interests from end to end of the Mediterranean and Sparta was interested, in her heart, only in the Peloponnese. The Greeks were quick, artistic and free and Spartans were slow-moving, dull and enslaved either to each other or to the military way of life.&quot; </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;In later years, the Greeks of other city-states sometimes admired the Spartan way of life because it seemed so virtuous and seemed to lead Sparta to such military glory. However, they were wrong to do so. In art, literature, music, love of life, all that makes it worthwhile to be on the earth, Sparta contributed nothing. She had only a cruel, inhuman way of life to offer, dependent on a brutal slavery of most of her population, with only a kind of blind animal courage as a virtue and her way of life soon became more show than substance. It was her reputation that saved her for a while when her core was rotten. She seemed strong as long as she won victories but whereas other states could withstand defeats and rise again, Sparta lost her domination of Greece after a single defeat. The loss of one major battle [at Leuctra, 371 BC] was to expose her and dispose of her.&quot;</span><br><br>What exactly is incorrect about this analysis?",

Of course those evils were just at home among the Huron as among the white man, as evidenced by Kondiaronk&#039;s desire to raid and pillage the Iroquois.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The great Lords, that you call Happy, lie expos&#039;d to Disgrace from the King, to the detraction of a thousand sorts of Persons, to the loss of their Places, to the Contempt of their Fellow Courtiers; and in a word, their soft Life is thwarted by Ambition, Pride, Presumption and Envy. They are Slaves to their Passions, and to their King, who is the only French Man that can be call&#039;d Happy, with respect to that adorable Liberty which he alone enjoys. There&#039;s a thousand of us in one Village, and you see that we love one another like Brethren; that whatever any one has is at his Neighbour&#039;s Service; that our Generals and Presidents of the Council have not more Power than any other Huron; that Detraction and Quarreling were never heard of among us; and in fine, that every one is his own Master, and do&#039;s what he pleases, without being accountable to another, or censur&#039;d by his Neighbour. This, my dear Brother, is the difference between us and your Princes, Dukes, &amp;c. And if those great Men are so Unhappy, by consequence, those of inferiour Stations must have a greater share of Trouble and perplexing Cares.</span><br><br>Kondiaronk therefore must have been a genius, more subversive than even the most kafkaesque pilpul of the most wily jews, sitting in his forest, 1000s of miles from Europe, he sowed the seeds of the white man&#039;s eventual descent into decadence, complacency and degeneracy. After all it was not rebellions that saw the end of colonialism, rather Europeans electing socialists and progressives and voluntarily granting them independence.",

Originally, this was insecurity of a peaceful agricultural people trying to live on vast exposed plain in neighborhood of fierce nomadic peoples. To this was added, as Russia came into contact with economically advanced West, fear of more competent, more powerful, more highly organized societies in that area. But this latter type of insecurity was one which afflicted rather Russian rulers than Russian people; for Russian rulers have invariably sensed that their rule was relatively archaic in form fragile and artificial in its psychological foundation, unable to stand comparison or contact with political systems of Western countries. For this reason they have always feared foreign penetration, feared direct contact between Western world and their own, feared what would happen if Russians learned truth about world without or if foreigners learned truth about world within. And they have learned to seek security only in patient but deadly struggle for total destruction of rival power, never in compacts and compromises with it.</span><br>He was right about everything. We only didn&#039;t realize how right.",

Mussolini may have been the progenitor of 20th century fascism but the ideology has its roots in pre-Marxist socialism/communism, it was known by a different name then. As to your point on Hitler, the man had failings but I doubt ego or homosexuality were counted among them. The Reich&#039;s economic policy began to buckle under the weight of foreign expansion and rearmament, but the civilian administration ran lean right up until the very end. Their ideology revolved around race and purity, this may have been one of their failings, but not in the way you imagine. Their emphasis on militarism came from Prussian ideals, their emphasis on strength came from similar, albeit more primitive, origins. They inflicted grave defeats on the entirety of the world over the course of both world wars, but as was judged in 1918, they could not fight the whole world alone, almost no one can. Whatever he may have been Hitler did not wish dominion over the world, he didn&#039;t even wish dominion over Alsace-Lorraine or Tyrol. He wanted Germany under one banner, more particularly he wished an end to the Jewish subjugation of Europe. If you are European, the latter of these two goals should forgive all else.",

It&#039;s most successful iterations did not go for broad sweeping central planning but rather a syndicalist model based off the strength of collective bargaining. When syndicalist tendencies are consolidated into the unified will of a homogenous state the labor offered is reciprocal to the benefits given and a sort of collaboration emerges between classes who all feel mutual good will towards each other. This incentivizes growth while simultaneously having fail safes that prevent shocks from having inordinate consequences to say the working class (capitalism) or the economy as a whole (communism). <br><br>Marx came along in the 19th century, hijacked the idea and said that all power needed to be consolidated in a dictatorial regime which would &quot;&quot;&quot;represent&quot;&quot;&quot; the will of the proletariat. They also go full command economy to ensure that everything was distributed &quot;&quot;&quot;fairly&quot;&quot;&quot; with harsh limitations on private property so that at any point labor could be confiscated from the worker. To anyone who was paying attention it became pretty clear that the purpose of the ideology was to wring as much possible value out of each laborer and offer him more than the industrialists of the time would give him, but far less than an actual true redistribution. Pair that with how top heavy central planning kinda is, and how prone to mistakes planners are, and you get the stupid bullshit that raped eastern Europe for the second half of the 20th century.",

Even if the dollar were to vanish it is always better to have civilian industry, especially heavy industry, separate from one another and operating with limited goals given the blast radius of shortages were this not the case. The soviet economy was plagued by this and even when they weren&#039;t rejecting mendelian genetics their heavy industry would regularly overproduce farm equipment or underproduce other such specialty equipment. I think the stalled out advancement of computing machines in particular highlights the shortcomings that hit specialized industry the hardest as a result of the Soviet system. <br><br>Here is an interesting video on that in particular. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnH<wbr>dqPBrtH8",

It is not 1:1 as China isn&#039;t really a command economy any more, at least in the relevant industries, but it is a way to undercut the global market and mitigate shocks. They were doing a lot of it in the 2010s as China&#039;s Asian neighbors began to start seriously producing and threaten their position as hegemon of cheap industrial goods. It was successful to a degree, but these things are still playing out so we have yet to see whether or not it was prescient and can overcome the obvious consequences of creating huge foreign reserves for geo-strategic rivals. <br><br>The bit on separation of civilian industry is more simple; i.e not having production of farm equipment tied to a quota X (informed by regional grain yield A) that will be produced at factory Y means that each member of the field competes with themselves and others to create more efficient platforms/production. It essentially debloats the work that planners need to do by encouraging indigenous solutions, it is not without peril and requires a consistent supply of highly technically skilled laborers and some plants failing in the process. Over the course of many decades, however, industry standards emerge and are followed to varying degrees, the fact that they arise naturally makes them more responsive as well, and consequences of failure have a smaller area of effect.",

The Hart-Cellar Act sought to dismantle the quota system in place since 1924 and finally opened the doors to Asian, African and Middle Eastern populations. Although Jews, with Israel available, no longer needed the open doors, major Jewish groups still rushed to support the bill. In a joint statement, seven national Jewish groups, including the American Jewish Congress and the Conservative movement\u2019s United Synagogue of America, called the bill a \u201clong overdue\u201d change to the quota system that had \u201cdefaced our immigration policy and mocked our national protestations of equality.\u201d</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Perhaps the most impassioned plea, however, came from a Jewish New York congressman named Leonard Farbstein, who told the House that the act would come too late for the Jews \u201cburied in mass graves at Auschwitz, Dachau and Bergen-Belsen\u201d who were denied U.S. visas.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But, Farbstein said, the new law would allow those murdered Jews to \u201crest easier in their graves\u201d because America may now provide an easier haven to refugees.</span>",

Even as early as 1789, states like New Jersey and Georgia allowed free black men and women to vote. This idea of America being founded as a white ethnostate is simply fantasy. At best, voting might&#039;ve been limited to land-owning white males, but more emphasis was put on them owning property than them being white, since most white men in the early US did not own property, and lived on chartered land. My 6th and 7th great grandparents for example would not be allowed to vote despite being white founding stock males, as they were not land owners.",

ALso, you are kinda overplaying endogamy here, nowadays political marriages aren&#039;t nearly as relevant as they were, and back in the day despite endogamy most monarchs didn&#039;t have issues, but the exceptions of the ones that actually were biologically screwed. Also, monarchy in average gives medium to decent rulers with some slight deviations towards either bad or good. In democracy its actually where you get one or two good guys and then a mass of morons, if we look at it empirically. Also aesthetics, that is a very strong factor for monarchy.",

The appeal of monarchism is similar to that of dictatorship, except you know that your dictator&#039;s children will be directly impacted by his decisions. A royal family can have vacation homes across the globe but their power will always depend on them being present in the country. Where a dictator can mess everything up and bail, a king has to more carefully weigh the impact on his own children. Which is a theoretically a powerful evolutional drive. It&#039;s about accountability. And people live under the illusion that democracy in some way makes politicians more accountable, but I&#039;ve seen enough during COVID to be completely disillusioned with that.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;single party government</span><br>On the surface this resembles a monarchy but it&#039;s actually extremely different. Most parties run either on branding or on an ideology. If they run on an ideology, then the contest for power within the party becomes a contest of orthodoxy. Over time, the party will radicalize because being deeply rooted in whatever the ideology is, is a pre-requisite for power.<br>If the party runs on branding then it&#039;s basically just an oligarchy.",

        "com": "People smugly dunk on American Low Church Christianity - in part because it&#039;s an easy target - but it seriously has some big strengths that make it more appealing than other branches of Christianity. See the problem with Catholicism, Orthodoxy, and High Church Protestantism is they are CONFESSIONAL and so you need to believe ABSOLUTELY in their doctrine or else even stepping foot in church is POINTLESS. Even if you believe in 99.9% of it but you just can&#039;t believe in the other 0.1% out of reason and conscience. The internet also makes information more widely accessible than ever before and you can easily find any tiny historical or theological error with these given sects to make you question them - in part and then in their entirety because these are CONFESSIONAL and demand ABSOLUTE belief without a SINGLE point of contention. American Low Church Christians, meanwhile, can handwave away all of this - at least everything that doesn&#039;t directly contradict with the Bible. Not to mention how easily they can isolate themselves away from the past - its sectarian baggage and some of the stupid/silly things Christians did - and it&#039;s much more &quot;inclusive&quot; than denominations. For example I don&#039;t believe in this but I&#039;m a multiethnic White American - my ancestors are a blend of Central and Eastern Europeans - I have no familial or racial reason to be a Catholic, Orthodox, Lutheran, or Calvinist but this type of nondenominational Christianity is much better at transcending that. At least I can sympathize with it so I definitely think people should be more self-aware especially trads here.",

It diminished the prestige and exclusivity of Roman citizenship. It diluted Roman identity, this wrecked Roman culture and values. It was the absolute worst thing to happen to Rome. It did not generate the tax revenue that these massive punic retard thought it would. It directly lead to the rise private armies because of what the edict did to the decentralizing of authority due to the aforementioned dilution of Roman identity. Literal barbarian peasants became emperor because of this retard and his edict <br>Secondary reasons<br> It stopped expanding. Ancient States needed fresh conquest, loot, slaves, people to exploit. This also meant less land grants to soldiers, less revenue to pay these soldiers and with such a massive border, defensive wars became more common than offensive wars. Lots of expense with no new conquest revenue.<br>Disease/Plague<br>Even Marcus Aurelius couldn&#039;t plan for something like this. Another huge destabilizing factor for ancient States, some plagues wiped out a sizable population and this would have been concentrated more in economically prosperous urban areas killing many people and decreasing tax revenue. Plagues also fucked the military in the loss of manpower and maneuverability.",

A full year off the end of the war would have greatly reduced the Soviet footprint in East Europe. There may not even have been an East Germany, especially since the Soviet army would never have made it to Berlin for the Great Raping and Looting. That would have been a huge loss of their stolen brain and industrial loot from Germany, plus the fact that Germany would have had so many more Germans alive and being productive krautisms<br><br>FDR would have been in much better health for whatever Yalta-equivalent negotiations that would have ensued, so Stalin would have got less than he did. The Soviets wouldn&#039;t have been positioned to occupy the Kurels, either. Japan would have fallen slightly faster with more resources available to pour into the Pacific theater. These are seriously significant factors that would have impacted containing the Soviets throughout the entire Cold War.<br><br>And, like it or not, there would have been at least one million (if not two) more Jews alive. That would also have impacted Jewish brain trust &amp; wealth while slightly reducing some of the worst concentration camp horrors. The highly traumatic repercussions of the Holocaust stories &amp; evidence would have had less influence over Western guilt ... if not in the first couple of decades than maybe not so strongly for so many decades. Not insignificant.<br><br>Overall, it would have made some huge differences. There is an entire tsunami of butterfly effects that would be virtually impossible to map out and determine with any certainty what today&#039;s world would look like. Changes in world political alliances alone can barely be imagined, NATO and the United Nations would be vastly different or maybe not even have happened at all in any form we see them today.",

Logic, analysis, subtle progression.<br> Why no anamnesis? Because Plato here is crafting a philosopher&#039;s map of love. It\u2019s not about memory; it\u2019s about method: how you go from one form of beauty to the next, until you reach the eternal.<br> Result: Love becomes a structured pathway to the Form of Beauty; clear, teachable, cumulative.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;this is Plato writing for a reader who is willing to climb, not one who is already overwhelmed by divine memory. Recollection would muddy the clean dialectical model.</span><br><br>Phaedrus (The Mythic, Mystical Approach)<br> Purpose: To explore love as a spiritual force that shatters rationality and awakens memory.<br> Method: Myth, poetry, imagery, divine madness.<br> Why include anamnesis and reincarnation?

I. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; It is assumed that in some cases certain archaeological findings can be dated with the aid of the ancient coinage found on the site. However, one should be aware that the so called numismatic dating as used today is wholly dependent on Scaligerian chronology. This chronology was created in the XVI-XVII century, and all the kings and rulers described in chronicles and other documents took certain chronological places. Then the ancient coins were distributed along the time axis \u2013 for instance, coins bearing the legend \u201cNero\u201d were dated to the I Scaligerian century A.D., the ones saying \u201cJustinian,\u201d as the VI Scaligerian century A.D., etc., since those are the centuries where Scaligerian chronology locates the Roman emperors Nero and Justinian.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After that, all of the coins found in the XVIII-XX century have either been dated by the same \u201cmethod,\u201d or compared to the ones that have already received datings, and placed on the time axis accordingly.</span><br><br>This is an excerpt from the beginning- his main complaint his that it relies on foreknowledge of when the to put the coins. So we say Nero is from the 1st century AD because that&#039;s what the books say. There are no extenuating clues nor dates on the vast majority of coins. Another piercing fact is that there is a dirth of coinage from after the 700s AD. Supposedly, this was the result of Pepin of the Franks who ceased production of the gold coinage, despite having access to gold. This is part of conventional medieval-Catholic history adopted by secularists today (this sentence is my words, not his, everything else is his).",

According to the historians, the coin caches of</span><br> the X-XIII century found on the territory of Russia hardly contain any Italian, French, or Spanish coins of X-XIII century A.D.. Only single Italian coins (!) of the X-XIII century have been found among the tens of thousands of coins dating from that period. Historians have created a theory that is supposed to explain this strange occurrence \u2013 namely, that there were no economical or trade connexions between Russia and Italy in the X-XIII century ([685] , pages 200-211). This \u201cnumismatic theory\u201d<br> contradicts written sources explicitly mentioning extensive trade and economic relations. The historian\u2019s commentary is that \u201cthe contradictions between the numismatic and other data is purely illusionary\u201d. However, no explanations of any kind are given.

Iberia has existed for millions of years and Gaul existed for nearly a millenium. Are you referring to fucking Classical Antiquity? How do you define &quot;civilized&quot;? Iberia as the chad and Gaul as the basedjak? Iberia in particular had multiple ethnicities in the same region. Gauls had diversity too and really, they were just the western subgroups of the last Celtic expansion from present-day Germany.<br><br>Iberia had &quot;Iberians&quot; (a confusing equivocation) living in present-day Catalonia and the eastern coasts. They spoke a non-Indo-European language that is also not easily related to Basque. During Classical Antiquity, they interacted with Phoenicians, Greeks and other more developed peoples, becoming more urbanized and economically advanced in the process. They invented their own writing system and therefore had all of the basic features of preindustrial civilization before conquest. The southwest of Iberia had the Tartessians who were also pre-Indo-European and elude ethno-linguistic classification. They urbanized, engaged in Mediterranean trade and invented a Greek-derived writing system similarly to Iberians. In the northwest of Iberia, there was an ethnic group called the Lusitanians, who spoke a language partially exhibiting Celtic qualities. It may have come from the first Celtic expansion outside Central Europe (Urnfield?). The Lusitanians were less urbanized and less economically connected and evidence of their exposure to writing consists of adoption of foreign scripts. They may be considered the ethnic precursor to the Portuguese. The Basques (or Aquitinians) were more remote and non-literate and continued to be basic iron age tribespeople until conquest. They lived much further into the Pyrenees and the southwest of France than they do in recent memory.",

Evidence is scarce but generally, more remote, inland and mountain regions had less connection to Mediterranean civilizing influence.<br><br>Gaul on the other hand was generally full of Celtic Gauls who had done the old prehistoric rape genocide routine on Atlantic Bronze Age people around 800 BC, who may have been Vasconic-speaking, around the same time Greeks readopted writing. As far as literacy, Gaullish tribes varied in their adoption of Hellenic writing and used it more near coastal trade outposts like Marsalla. Leading up to fullscale Roman invasion, they gradually formed larger settlements called oppida. It&#039;s a general trend in preindustrial history that exposure to trade networks came with population growth and growing settlements. Generally speaking, Celts were a distinct culture of fair-skinned snowniggers. Before Roman conquest, Celts were generally less advanced than Mediterranean peoples because the geographical spread of technological development simply had yet to reach them.",

Show me any passage that you&#039;re having trouble interpreting and I can guarantee that 9 times out of 10 the Catholics and Orthodox will agree with each other&#039;s commentary and interpretation and even point out to you how their agreement on it can be traced historically. Again, these &quot;problems&quot; are really only problems for those who are directly motivated to remain inert instead of motivated to solve things. It&#039;s convenient to pretend that because someone in Alabama registered a new &quot;church&quot;, suddenly it&#039;s more difficult to orient yourself in what is the Traditional interpretation of a passage. You don&#039;t take this approach in any other domain lol. Because in every other domain your identity isn&#039;t based on shrugging your shoulders.",

FDR did intend to join the war in Europe. But by 1941, he was trying to avoid a confrontation in the Pacific. His suggestion after Indochina was occupied by the Japanese was to see if he could come to an agreement with Japan to regard it as a &quot;neutral country like Switzerland.&quot;<br><br>In the summer leading up Pearl Harbor, the Japanese refused to come to any diplomatic agreement with the US that ruled out hostilities. They chose to remain in the Tripartite Pact. Even after Barbarossa beginning two months after they signed a neutrality pact with the USSR gave them the easiest out imaginable. Nonetheless, US diplomats tried to come to an agreement that that would prevent war with Japan.<br><br>Japan&#039;s leadership didn&#039;t want war either at this time. Yet they were willing to sacrifice absolutely nothing to actually achieve it. Yamamoto thought war was a bad idea, but still went ahead drafting war plans anyway.<br><br>It was in this environment that the Hull Note was written. Despite the terms being highly conciliatory, it&#039;s remembered as a declaration of war by Japanese nationalists on account of it calling for a withdrawal from China and recognition of the ROC&#039;s government. (Herbert Bix suggests that the biggest sticking point was that Hull didn&#039;t distinguish between Manchukuo and China.) <br><br>After the Hull Note was sent on November 26, there was radio silence from Japan. In the time between then and December 7, the US knew war with Japan would arrive at some point.<br><br>It wasn&#039;t a righteous struggle against colonialism, withholding of oil, or a Chinese charm offensive that provoked the Pacific War. The blame lays at the feet of the incompetent Imperial leadership. Those who knew a total war with the Allies would be unwinnable, but chose to gamble anyway.",

The example that brought this to my attention was Christianity v. Vedic traditions. They both propose an infinite source (and sustainer) of all being who has a hierarchy of spirits beneath for mediation. But the similarities are so profound that one of the most imactful elaborations on the Christian God was a book where an Orthodox Christian scholar was directly elaborating on Sat-Chit-Ananda, the essential attributes of Brahman. <br>Of course there are differences because each religion has something unique about themselves - in this case Christianity absolutely insists that personhood is divine and we only have diminutive versions of it that we need to perfect, whereas Vedic, Buddhist and Gnostic traditions say that personhood is just a default human thingy that needs to be left behind. And that&#039;s a profound disagreement. But the picture in which this disagreement is being had is way more similar than anyone would predict if religious stories were arbitrarily made up.<br><br>When it comes to smaller religions there are various tropes and paradigms that cults usually have. Some of them can be written off as direct consequence of human psychology (such as cults usually positing a spiritual origin of a human community), but some are a little more specific. For example Mircea Eliade describes deus otiosus - the idle god or the god who has abandoned a cult. To me as a Christian this checks out with the Biblical narrative: God was governing the Earth, the tower of Babel happens, he hands over the nations to smaller deities to focus on Hebrews, then starts wiping the floor with the deities because the Salvation has come through his Son. It&#039;s only natural smaller cults would start wondering why their deity suddenly went away. They were afraid of Christ. Similarly, we have records of pagans complaining that their rituals don&#039;t work when Christians are around.",

Sadly the nations started worshipping the minor deities themselves and the deities accepted the worship, effectively stealing the flock they were only supposed to temporarily keep.

Whether there existed deities that resisted this temptation, I don&#039;t know but at least the Vedic tradition makes me think that some religions didn&#039;t stray as far away from truth as others.",
