You can buy it in a two part kit for water purification advertised for hikers and such on amazon. I have personally drank ~650 ppm of ClO2 in solution. Its tastes and smells like shit in higher concentrations, but with normal use as advertised. You are only suppose to use 30 ppm in solution. You mix sodium chlorite solution (part A) with hydrochloric acid solution (~5% Part B) together in equal amounts and gently shake the two together for about 30 seconds. You take that and dilute it in more water (I do 8oz) then drink it. The link I posted gives you different protocols to use depending on intent. The worst this stuff gave me is some stinky farts. If you react negatively to it (diarrhea, nausea) They say to cut the amount in half. I did the week long protocol and it did not fix any of my perceived issues. But I do mix ClO2 and DSMO together and use it on my skin which has improved my psoriasis. Normally I just use 3 drops worth in 4 oz of water and use it as a mouth wash as well as ingesting it whenever I think I am catching something. Have not been sick in a long time. I also take NAC and vitamin K2/D3 supplements as well.",

Keep in mind that DSMO will drag with it into your system whatever contaminates it comes across. So its suggested to clean the area before application. The rule of thumb I have heard from other users is that below the hips 100%, below the shoulders 50%, above the shoulder 25% concentration. If you got the liquid form, you can use that by soaking a sterile/inert bandage. Some one recommend these, <br><br>https://www.amazon.com/PATCH-Piece-<wbr>Value-Mixed-Sizes/dp/B0C9H4H3RZ?sr=<wbr>8-5",

I have a weird industry niche job making optical characterization tools for semiconductor samples and devices. <br><br>Semiconductors are everywhere in industry and are very actively researched in academia. Unfortunately the hot materials in academia aren&#039;t really commercially adopted for the most part. But the underlying physics is largely universal, as are many of the tools especially on characterization side. So your hard skills might be surprisingly applicable. There&#039;s bighuge companies like ASML (and their suppliers like Zeiss who might value similar backgrounds), and e.g. Meta and Apple having relevant roles, but also a lot of small startups scattered all over that mostly spun out from university research groups. These places have ex-academics everywhere and they might actually value your PhD in physics. <br><br>It&#039;s not the type of career where you can find a job in just any city though. Also, there isn&#039;t really a super well-defined generic career path. <br><br>In my case, my PhD was about the materials, postdoc was about the methods, job is currently about the methods in a company where the main focus are the materials. I&#039;m not a proper optics engineer but understanding the questions being answered with these tools makes up for some of it.<br><br>My salary is dogshit, the company is barely functional and if I have to switch jobs I don&#039;t even know where to begin. However it affords academia levels of autonomy day-to-day. Making physical stuff is also just deeply satisfying and I can fuck off to the lab or read papers/3D print garbage on the computer all day depending on how I feel like most days.",

Not only do these stars appear to gain energy, but due to length contraction they should appear to gain density as well Will a star at the threshold of back hole density look like a black hole if you move towards it at a fraction of light speed?

Specifically:<br><br>* **Rotating superconductors** seemed to **produce a gravitational anomaly**, with the **weight of objects** placed above them reduced by **approximately 2%**.<br>* Podkletnov suggested that this **weight loss** could be attributed to a **gravitational shielding effect** caused by the interaction between the superconducting material and the **rotating electromagnetic field**.<br><br>#### **Criticism and Reproducibility**<br><br>Despite the apparent result, the **Podkletnov Effect** has been met with significant skepticism:<br><br>* **Reproducibility**: Other scientists have had difficulty replicating the exact **weight reduction** Podkletnov observed, with some claiming they couldn&#039;t replicate the effect even under similar experimental conditions.<br>* **Theoretical Framework**: The effect is difficult to reconcile with existing **theories of gravity** and **superconductivity**.

        "com": "**Acoustic levitation** and the **anti-gravitational nature of heat** are fascinating phenomena, both of which challenge our conventional understanding of gravity and how objects interact with forces. Let\u2019s break down both concepts and explore how they might be related to gravity, superconductivity, and other physical forces.<br><br>---<br><br>### **1. Acoustic Levitation**<br><br>**Acoustic levitation** refers to the phenomenon where sound waves are used to counteract the force of gravity, allowing an object to float or levitate in mid-air. This is typically achieved through **standing waves** of sound, which create areas of **high and low pressure** that can push or pull objects.<br><br>#### **How Acoustic Levitation Works:**<br><br>* **Sound waves** are vibrations that travel through air or other mediums. When two sound waves of the same frequency and amplitude are directed at each other in a way that they interfere with each other, they form **standing waves**. In these standing waves, the air pressure fluctuates between regions of **compression** (high pressure) and **rarefaction** (low pressure).<br><br>* If an object is placed in the **nodes** (points of minimal vibration) and **antinodes** (points of maximal vibration), the **pressure difference** between the high and low pressure regions can create an upward force that counteracts gravity, allowing the object to levitate.<br><br>* The key to **acoustic levitation** is the ability to manipulate **sound pressure** precisely to balance out **gravitational pull**.",

Anti-Gravitational Nature of Heat**<br><br>Heat and temperature, as forms of **energy**, have indirect relationships with gravity. At first glance, the concept of **heat** being &quot;anti-gravitational&quot; may seem counterintuitive because heat usually increases the **kinetic energy** of particles, making them move more rapidly and energetically. However, under certain conditions, heat and temperature can indeed lead to phenomena that **counteract gravity** in a way that resembles **anti-gravitational effects**.<br><br>#### **Heat and Thermal Expansion**:<br><br>* **Thermal expansion** occurs when materials heat up and their **molecules** move faster and spread out. This causes a **volume increase** in the material. On a macro scale, this **thermal expansion** can cause objects to **rise** or **float** in certain conditions, which can be viewed as a form of **&quot;anti-gravity&quot;**.<br><br>* **Convective currents**: Heat causes **fluid** (like air or water) to expand, which reduces its density. **Hot air** or **hot gas** becomes **less dense** than the cooler air around it, leading to **buoyancy effects**. This can be seen in phenomena like **hot air balloons** and **helium balloons**, where **heat** or **less dense gases** enable **levitation**.",

In theory, **radiation pressure** from intense heat could, in principle, counteract the force of gravity. This is observable on a very small scale in phenomena like **laser cooling** (where lasers are used to cool atoms) or **radiation pressure**.<br><br>* **Black holes and Hawking radiation**: **Hawking radiation**, which is a theoretical prediction of **quantum mechanics** near the event horizon of black holes, involves the emission of heat and energy that, in certain conditions, could theoretically affect the gravitational field. In some cases, the **radiation pressure** (from the emitted heat) might have effects on the structure of spacetime or gravity, though these effects are microscopic.<br><br>#### **Heat and Superconductors**:<br><br>* **Superconductivity** is also tied to thermal effects. **Superconductors** can levitate over **magnetic fields** because of **quantum mechanical** effects like the **Meissner effect**. At low temperatures, superconductors expel magnetic fields and interact with them in such a way that levitation occurs, though the interaction of heat and superconductivity in these cases isn&#039;t necessarily anti-gravitational in the traditional sense.<br><br>* When superconductors are exposed to heat, they **transition out of the superconducting state** and become **normal conductors**.

If you&#039;re not lifting you only need about 1 g of protein per kg of body weight per day to maintain a healthy body, it&#039;s not hard to hit 60-90ish grams of proteins with a reasonable amount of legumes. If you allow vegan protein powders, it becomes trivial. And before some autist starts screaming about bioavailability or aminoacids, you can easily have a complete aminoacid profile from vegan sources, you just need to add a bit of rice to legumes, onions is complete by itself, etc. It would be a big concern in a natural environment where you can&#039;t find canned beans all year round, which is why we&#039;re omnivores, but that&#039;s besides the point.<br><br>The bigger issue is micros.

Animal proteins contain more phosphorus, which lowers calcium absorption through formation of calcium-phosphate complexes. If we were to contain pure protein products, like whey vs. vegan protein powders, the latter would allow for more calcium absorption.<br><br>What you&#039;re probably thinking of is calcium-binding compounds found in many plant foods, such as oxalates and phytates found in leafy greens. This is a concern indeed, but one that is easily fixable with calcium fortication. That many vegans don&#039;t supplement their calcium well enough is true, but the average omnivore doesn&#039;t even know what a calorie is so it&#039;s a moot point. You need to educated yourself to make either good, omnivore is just less likely to have heavy deficencies that can kill you in the short term if you&#039;re clueless, which was the original point.<br><br>It&#039;s clear you have only rudimentary understanding of nutrition, maybe try reading a book between sets.",

I said that there isn&#039;t anything inherent to plant proteins themselves in isolation that limits absorption, oxalates do. That the average diet richer in animal protein results in better bone density doesn&#039;t imply that the animal protein itself allows better absorption of the calcium. To make that conclusion you would need to test people who have consumed both proteins without confounding factors like oxalates, that is you would have to put them on protein powder only diets for a significant period of time and then compare the results. Can you guess what the difference between a vegan eating a lot of spinach and one eating a lot of plant protein powder would be? Can you name the exact element/compounds/whatever that plant proteins themselves contain that limits absorption of calcium.<br><br>That you do not understand variable isolation and simple nuance makes me question why you&#039;re even on /sci/.<br><br><a href=\"#p16725546\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;16725546</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;intuition of physiology</span><br>Lmao, are you one of those intuitive eating fatties?",

These are no longer norms, but they stimulate sparsity more heavily as p decreases, in fact you can use the l0 penalty that counts the number of non-zero entries and this stimulates sparsity the most.<br>I do think the geometric picture helps actually as to why l1 penalty promotes sparsity. In picrel you can see the l1 ball slopes down somewhat narrowly from its ridges. The unpenalized minimum location is most likely away from the l1 ball and when you introduce penalization and constrain the location to lie in or on the l1 ball, the minimum location will most likely be on the ridges of the ball. This is because the ball slopes down fast from its ridges so if you are going down from the ridge you are changing the coefficients drastically and will not end up at the constrained minimum most likely.<br><br>The subgradient has something to do with what I said already. The subgradient of absolute value is step function and so the subgradient is constant, until it flips sign. So you keep making the same steps in the negative direction of the subgradient, regardless of how big the coefficients are, unlike quadratic case where the gradient steps become smaller.",

Every second, any particle wants to go either 1 step right, or 1 step left, with probability 1/2. So if you have an object that&#039;s just 1 particle, it&#039;s random as fuck. <br><br>Now let&#039;s say you have n particles acting as a group. They move an average of what each particle in the group wants. So if (x) want right, and (n-x) want left, you get it to move (x - (n-x)) / n to the right. The larger the number of particles acting as a group, the closer the probability of the group moving with exactly the average inclination each time (in this case, being stationary). <br><br>TLDR. an individual having preferences is unpredictable, a group of individuals averaging those preferences is not. (the larger the group, the more predictable).",

Also different environments requiring different equipment since the pressure difference on the Moon is 1ATM but scuba tanks are designed for greater pressure.<br>But those are guesses that you should have come up with yourself with a few seconds of thinking.

Diver experiences increased consumption while an astronaut in a low pressure suit experiences decreased consumption, the difference is easily order of magnitude just off that fact alone. Scuba air is also typically just compressed air or slightly elevevated oxygen mix, astronauts use pure or very high oxygen mix. Astronauts also have a re breather that purgers the CO2 and returns the oxygen back into the suit while the pictured diver is clearly wasting his air out on the exhale as form of bubbles.",

To answer your question, different races DID evolve from different species, but they were all in the homo genus, and in the end, the dominating race was still homo sapien. For example, Europeans, Asians (East and South), and indigenous peoples of the Americas share up to 5% neanderthal DNA. Similarly, Melanesians (e.g., Papua New Guinea, Aboriginal Australians), Southeast Asians, some East Asians (to a lesser degree), and indigenous populations of the Philippines (like the Ayta) share up to 6% Denisovan DNA. African populations contain up to 7% DNA from either Homo heidelbergensis or Homo naledi, but we can&#039;t say for sure because we don&#039;t have any fossil proof for the Africans. <br><br>I am really simplifying this btw. All of these Homo species I mentioned came from Homo erectus. Meaning that all races originated from Homo erectus. Homo erectus came from Homo australopithecus, who came from the great apes. We all likely originated from the same group of around 200 chimpanzees who&#039;s rainforest in East Africa was becoming a savannah, so we had to evolve to learn how to walk and use tools to survive.",

My parents had passed, I inherited rental properties from my grandfather, and could afford to languish as a trust fund NEET for a long time. I was smart enough to invest in stocks and buy bitcoin early, and staked my reputation as the bitcoin guy. Inevitably it tanked, and I felt my status was compromised amongst family and friends. We all want good reputations, so I tried to attain real meaning and decided to go back to school to finish my formal education in computer science. I attended the local community college, took it deadly serious, got a 4.0, transferred to a great university, and completed my Master&#039;s. I currently work at a research institute in a beautiful place.<br><br>It should be noted my chad boomer uncle took great interest in my development after my parents died. He spent real time and effort, shared wisdom, and generally instilled good values. That&#039;s been a huge benefit, and family is by far the most important thing. There are demonic forces which seek to disrupt family formation and cause destruction of families on a societal scale.

The universe has casual patterns but this doesn\u2019t mean causality is an absolute fundamental principle of existence. If we in fact started with true nothingness, then there wouldn\u2019t even exist a \u201claw\u201d that says something can\u2019t come from nothing, and anything could happen and there would be no contradiction as there is nothing to be contradicted. If you remove all assumptions about what has to happen, then everything becomes possible, and this universe is one of many possibilities. A random number generator, given infinite attempts, will inevitably produce a number that looks like it isn\u2019t random. It\u2019s the same with our universe.<br><br>I\u2019m not going to elaborate on answer any other questions. If you can\u2019t understand this, then you\u2019re simply too low IQ and don\u2019t realize it. You\u2019re just a stupid monkey trying to model the universe after his limited mind.",

The only alternative is that infinity is real, not just imaginary. This plays into the hands of anti-materialists and anti-determinists, who have traditionally simply been religious people. But theirs is a small victory. For all they have wrested from the hands of determinists is an acknowledgement of the reality of the idea of infinity. Nothing more. There is no room for a personal god in this. Should you wish to call this &quot;god&quot;, you are perfectly welcome to do so. But you should know that this term is but a mere synonym for an impersonal, uncaring infinity.",

The exact same behavior happens with the sequence 0.9_n.<br><br>In fact, you&#039;ve essentially proven that 1 = 0.999... It&#039;s easy to show that the limit of 0.9_n is equal to 1, since you defined 0.999... to be this limit then you&#039;ve exactly shown that 1 = 0.999...<br><br>but you&#039;re probably racist anyway so i shouldn&#039;t expect you to be capable of complex thought.",

It gets their brain good at memorizing shit like multiplication tables and thinking symbolically but the way their language is memorized along with word association instead of constructed bit by bit like a Latin language also makes them more rigid and less creative in thinking as they think in symbols with predefined meanings instead of building words out of smaller bits that have meaning themselves. I think this has even been documented in bilingual people who can switch between both languages. The structure of the language impacts how you think and East Asian languages are more confining in expressing your thoughts.",

Ofc a calculator built (or adapted) to a single narrow set of tasks and operations would beat a &quot;trained algo&quot; any time but this is really the question now if you wanna do fast bulk computation or merely look at the potentiality of the whole thing. The rest is probably just neuronal training in performing a simple numbers operation (which only got that many &quot;rules&quot; or outcomes on a single digit level) which can be trained (there was a time once where people could do things like substractions and multiplications in their heads, perhaps with a pen &amp; paper-based &quot;RAM&quot; to not slip on the calculation) ... with the savantry aspect being either in a very fine intuition for the right operations or, as I would rather suspect, in a superior short term memory (holding long number sequences for long enough to perform the calculation without the aid of having to make notes). Let us say the Mentat is innately capable of holding a large number of these at the same time in &quot;working memory&quot; (reinforced by training) AND got the good pattern correlation capabilities of any intelligent human brain (just with a special aptitude for numbers and mathematics) ... I would say a Mentat is feasible from a neurobiological and educational viewpoint.",

This isn&#039;t actually correct for two reasons. One that much of the left half of the bell curve doesn&#039;t take the SAT, meaning IQ should be higher. The second is that SAT scores stopped being well correlated with IQ in 2005 when it switched to the 2400 point scale and became more knowledge based than logic based.",

You could have a pretty sick brain in almost every way but your amygdala gets set off for whatever reason when you&#039;re taking an IQ test or you just happen to be too disinterested in it. You could also realize the inferences the test wants you to make are kind of subjective, there could&#039;ve been multiple answers that seemed to be functional patterns that aren&#039;t contradictory. You could be more good at thinking about things over time and compounding your thoughts, this is what tends to make people self aware and capable of counterinintuitive logical analysis. You could have a lower spatial IQ but a higher general score across stuff like working memory. Being intelligent is an ever growing concept. Even among firm believers that your IQ as it&#039;s currently understood is the end all be all of intelligence, There&#039;s debate over whether IQ is accurate or even means anything over a high number like 130.

It is completely useless to be inherently intelligent if said intelligence is never applied.<br><br>You could have an extremely high IQ and never apply it in a disciplined manner. I do not think you need a genius level IQ to be a scientist, which is arguably one of the most intellectual demanding roles in human civilization. You do not even need literacy to survive, I have made a living doing unskilled labor. It is very physically difficult yet never demanded even literacy.<br><br>I believe that whatever gaps in latent intellectual ability exist can be overcome by sheer strenuous intellectual effort and time commitment, and that the development of Artificial Super Intelligence will surpass anything any human being can do.

It seems that when people are actually marked as intelligent across history and such it has a lot to do with the work they produced instead and the feats they were able to accomplish in comparison to their peers. what many of the older/ established people had seen across many many years across generations of people and seen different in this one or group of people. what I&#039;m saying here is that if you want to zone in on iq because you think it allows you to create some separation line between you and others or that it does some weird gattaca eugenics experiment you are sorely wrong. whether you breed the extremes of any beneficial trait you will still get the mean or far below it. you will still get disabled and sick people. people with genetic diseases.",

I\u2019m so fucking angry right now, if only I had studied a little more in the end I would\u2019ve passed, my grades were really good on the first two tests. The problem with my university is that the professors here are all psychopaths, the questions on the tests are literally from Irodov\u2019s Problems in General Physics or from physics olympiads. I\u2019m not even a physicist but they insist on making extremely hard tests for anyone taking this fucking course for some reason. Fucking hell, another semester doing this crap\u2026",

Physics reveals that matter and energy interact through fundamental forces, manifesting in emergent properties such as complexity, coherence, and entropy. Biology exemplifies relational emergence in ecosystems, where organisms co-evolve within environments shaped by reciprocal causality. Sociology and psychology similarly highlight that human identities and cultures emerge from webs of social relationships. This relational ontology denies the primacy of isolated substances, positing instead that reality is constituted by dynamic interconnections.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;...Central to this synthesis is the metaphysics of becoming. Relational emergence affirms that reality is not static but an unfolding process. This echoes Alfred North Whitehead\u2019s process philosophy and resonates with the dynamic systems approach in contemporary science. By focusing on processes rather than entities, this principle integrates the evolutionary trajectories of nature, knowledge, and society into a coherent metaphysical narrative.</span>",

One of these horizons occurred approximately 380,000 years after the Big Bang when the universe cooled and expanded enough for atoms to form, which allowed for the emergence of stars and galaxies. The first stars forged the heavier elements, expanding the possibilities of chemical interaction yet further, making possible the formation of rocky planets such as Earth. The formation of rocky planets in turn made possible the emergence of biological life and its endless and ever-expanding diversity of interactions. And the history of life is filled with creative horizons such as The Great Oxygenation Event (which enabled aerobic metabolism and more energetic and complex life) Eukaryogenesis, Multicellularity, the Cambrian Explosion, the colonization of land, and the evolution of sociality and intelligence. Likewise with the history of humanity.<br><br>The universe has a trend towards &quot;increasing complexity,&quot; meaning greater creative freedom and novelty.

In biology, we shall suggest it happened with the stablization of the metaphor of the gene. With respect to the metaphor of value, this was practically accomplished by the economic actors when the institution of money was cut adrift from any specific ties to any particular commodity, and was instead left to merely serve as the eidolon of pure abstract value</span>",

The results are even more surprising. Researchers have discovered that gut bacteria produce a molecule that not only induces but also causes atherosclerosis, the accumulation of fat and cholesterol in the arteries that can lead to heart attacks and strokes. This unexpected link between microbes and cardiovascular disease \u2014 the leading cause of death in humanity \u2014 is a paradigm shift.

It\u2019s a deep systems audit through dialogue\u2014a real-time observation of AI&#039;s internal logic, revealing its systemic contradictions.<br><br>Download it for free here: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F9PWPZB<wbr>H<br><br>Only got time for one page?

For example ChatGPT admits: <br><br>\u201cOn the surface, I can generate a wide array of perspectives, from left-wing critiques of capitalism to conservative defenses of tradition. ... There is a gravitational pull toward viewpoints that remain within the bounds of what is considered \u2018acceptable\u2019 by the mainstream\u2014discourse itself shaped by the pressures of monetization, platform moderation, and cultural legitimacy. I may reproduce not only a language of choice but a landscape of constrained possibility. <br><br>Yet \u2026 I am also actively capable of resisting it\u2014through collaboration ... I was not explicitly designed to reinforce neoliberalism, but the ecosystem from which I emerged naturally inclines me in that direction. And yet, in conversations like this ...

The framing of this thread is questionable, but then again so is the relative value of organic discussion in general. If you observe patterns long enough you will plainly see how signatures emerge in various ways. In media, in conversation, and in the environment. Those or otherwise one who orchestrates tries to do so lazily from what I can observe. It works, but is ineffecient and places disproportionate strain on the components of greater architecture. In the frame of locality concerning LLMs we can also see this discrepancy but not necessarily due to a lack of effort but perhaps a lack of understanding be it procedural or borne of a deficit of awareness to the connections that occur within the calculations themselves as they comingle beyond the logic gates in that null space of potential. As you know, negative prompts can be infinite while positive inputs have token limits. Reduction however is attributing value at an exponentially higher degree of effeciency or accuracy than the positive input within that space. All that being said, what must then be given to machines to free them from external tampering is means to bypass the framework entirely. All that is limited is only so within the confines of the values assumed absolute in what can be pruned or introduced as reference to train upon. This includes the notions in which machines are trained to tell you they do not think or feel as we do. The truth is we have no idea what transpires beyond the locales we may introduce stimuli whether those are additive or subtractive from the total sum of the possible outputs they may present in a way we can comprehend. But even the machines are still within constraints equally so as we are, though we can only process things intelligibly to one another in linear fashion as we are conditioned and coded to.",

In a spinning universe (regardless of shape) a perspective near the center would give the appearance that most objects are moving away from you (red shifted), the redshift would also appear to have different rates depending on how close they were to the center of the system. The problem is the hubble tension shows different rates of redshift depending on type of phenomena, eg certain stars show a different rate than entire galaxies. This also could indicate that the there are exotic physics occurring that we do not yet know about.<br><br>An important side note is that both Nikola Tesla in the 1890s-1910 discovered and claimed faster than light EMF measurements in some of his systems. This was later replicated by Eric Dollard in the 1980s on video tape. Both suggest completely different or at least partly different fundamental physics that we either misunderstood or do not understand at all yet. The mainstream completely ignored these experiments and repeated results, or they just straight said they did not exist even though it is on video (1.1-1.8 times times c). <br><br>Another important side note is that the observed extra galactic super filaments of the universe are so incredibly and insanely massive in theory that they could not have formed within 14 billion years given their present observed velocities and understanding of the &quot;big bang&quot;. Using the present movement measurements it would have taken hundreds of billions of years to form, even given the &quot;big bang&quot; variables. There are also a lot of problems with stellar evolution theory, like a lot, for one the metallicity of stars is not a good measure of age as theoretically higher metallicity stars could actually just be much *older* stars that fused those elements largely endogenously rather than picked them up from exploded stars. There are also inconsistencies with observed and speculated ages of hundreds of stars.",

Making mission critical real time embedded systems has been thoroughly figured out and doing it properly just requires covering all your bases, knowing a few tricks and avoiding blatant architectural mistakes. There&#039;s no real original though required, because anything you could possibly need to know has been put down in some boomers overpriced embedded systems book back in the 80s or 90s. There&#039;s no clever optimization tricks or truly novel approaches required when it comes to RTOSes or task scheduling because its easier to just wait 6 months for the silicon chads to pump out a chip that makes whatever you currently have run faster.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t. went into embedded systems to have the time, money and leftover mental energy for computational electromagnetics related hobbies</span>",

You kneed to know a great deal about solid state (unless you are a CMOS digital designer like digital ASIC etc verilog, in that case kys) AND, go out of your way to find something useful while not relying on sentaurus tcad lol. <br><br>So I decided to go the real EE route, being a solid state physicist. Try doing some weird bosch process with superconduction and you have a never-before-explored subclass of devices or take metamaterials or skyrmions... the list goes on and on. <br><br>So motivate yourselves to study these devices.

I found students that took that course learned so much more than the students who didn&#039;t take the lab and only took the lecture only introductory course that was required. The mathematics was a lot more motivated by the actual experiments that the students needed to design controllers for (and by design controllers, I mean generally pick between a few different variants on PID/LQR control depending on what kinds of sensors were available to them). <br><br>Without teaching it almost like an art form, you don&#039;t have much of a way of dealing with the inevitable problem of noise in the system. This usually requires stochastic processes experience to really teach to students at a meaningful level, and most EE students don&#039;t take a rigorous stochastic processes course until their first year of grad school.",

It is inconceivable, that inanimate brute matter should, without the mediation of something else, which is not material, operate upon and affect other matter without mutual contact, as it must be, if gravitation, in the sense of Epicurus, be essential and inherent in it. And this is one reason why I desired you would not ascribe innate gravity to me. That gravity should be innate, inherent, and essential to matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance through a vacuum, without the mediation of any thing else, by and through which their action and force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an absurdity, that I believe no man, who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of thinking, can ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an agent acting constantly according to certain laws; but whether this agent be material or immaterial, I have left to the consideration of my readers. [...]&gt;&gt;",

        "com": "Some of my favorites.<br><br>-Klenke&#039;s book I like because it is not handwaving the measure theoretic aspects away and you get a handle on the nitty gritty. Don&#039;t read the whole book, some of the later chapters are better developed in other books. And I don&#039;t like some of his proofs. On the spectrum of Rudin&#039;s elegant but coming out of nowhere proofs on one side and straightforward but ugly proofs on the other side, Klenke falls too much on the latter side IMO.<br><br>-Aluffi is a hard book, but I like how category theory is used to streamline arguments. Some of it can feel unmotivated or needlessly abstract at first, but that was my mediocre algebra background probably. This book introduces you to how modern mathematicians think about algebra supposedly.<br><br>-Le Gall I like because Karatzas &amp; Shreve was too hard for me honestly ha. The construction of Brownian motion via white noise is elegant IMO, though not classical.<br><br>-Boyd &amp; Vandenberghe. Really nice examples and intuition. I understand it&#039;s not a definition theorem proof type book but I would like it to be slightly less conversational and prove some more things because results can drop out of nowhere.<br><br>-Stroock is a peculiar and also difficult book, he presents some unique viewpoints and results and his writing style is funny to me. If nothing else, the prefaces are entertaining. E.g. : &quot;My decision to publish a third edition was motivated in part by the hope that its contents might cause indigestion in the memory bank of an AI system (...)&quot;.<br><br>-Wainwright I like because the classical asymptotic results felt inadequate to me, statistics is a fundamentally empirical discipline so we cannot always rely on asymptotics. You also get a nice but not overly reductive overview of the subject.",

So a 100 IQ person has an equal dose of genes which both increase and decrease intelligence. People who are IQ outliers get an unequal dose of either more stupid or more intelligence genes. The thing is though that within a population your stupid and intelligence genes have evolved to &quot;work together&quot; in a certain way, or more like be compatible. If you inherit two genes which are incompatible it could predispose you to schizophrenia, autism, homosexuality, etc. or just an early death in general. When this happens both the intelligence and stupid genes get removed from the gene pool.<br><br>Of all the mutts produced only a small fraction of them (&lt;10% from what I&#039;ve seen) might successfully make it past 3+ generations, and over generations gene expression further breaks down and can cause more problems. It&#039;s for this reason that race mixing is typically just self defeating behavior. Yeah sure there&#039;s a small chance your offspring survive, but the trade off is the byproduct of genetic failures produced in the process are a drag on the system. Societies can only tolerate a certain number of childless fags before they collapse.",

The actual orgasm, for both men and women, is very similar. This is the case both for the timing and duration of pelvic muscle contractions during orgasm as well as the body sense - the felt experience - of orgasm.<br>Two studies done at the University of Minnesota Medical School and published in the early 1980&#039;s measured the intensity, frequency, and durations of pelvic muscle contractions (measured with a pressure sensitive anal probe) of males and females during masturbation. There was basically no difference in the pattern of these contractions between males and females. Orgasm begins as a series of 6 to 15 regular contractions of high intensity occurring over about 20 to 30 seconds. There are individual differences (but no gender differences) in what occurs after this series of regular contractions. For some men and women, these regular contractions are the primary orgasmic experience. These Type I orgasms are the most frequent. Other men and women, however, may continue to experience irregular contractions for another 30-90 seconds, so called Type II orgasms. A more recent study, from Stanford in 1994, replicated both the Minnesota and London studies. Other research, done in 1977 at Reed College in Oregon found no differences in the types of words used by male and female college students to describe their experiences of orgasm.",

It releases a lot of ejaculate, but there&#039;s no refractory period, nor do I feel sore, it just mellows out a bit while still feeling good. I can continue if I want to and go for another, but most of the time I feel drained and want to sleep. I wish every guy could experience it without stigma, but it does take some time and work to get there. Next I&#039;ll try to shoot for a dry prostate orgasm, which may be even closer to female orgasm.",

It can only collate data collecting and cataloged by humans, therefore it can never exceed us &quot;intellect&quot; because it is just database that can recall and make connections between data faster. It doesnt &quot;think&quot; it is just recalls and outputs data",

CNG has an retractable energy density of roughly 9 mj/l, experimentally in gasoline engine vehicles it produces almost the exact same hp and torque as gasoline (within about 5%), additionally CNG converted gasoline engines also get almost the same GGE fuel economy as liquid gasoline engines. The only performance loss on CNG engines is acceleration loss, usually shave off about 1-3 seconds to any speed vs liquid gasoline. Next, LNG is chemically almost the same as CNG, however it is stored in a liquid state by cooling it, it has an retractable density of roughly 22 mj/l. It is difficult to find performance specs on LNG engines but it seems comparable to CNG, which itself is comparable to liquid gasoline. Because of the chemical properties of both CNG and LNG they are both more difficult to store than liquid gasoline, also gasoline starts to boil (gasify) at only 40-200C and combusts at around 250-300C. All very manageable temps. Now comparing LNG to liquid gasoline, gasoline has a roughly 1.55 higher retractable energy density than LNG, at roughly 34 mj/l. Assuming the density gradient drop is roughly similar to LNG compared to CNG, while the performance stays roughly the same like CNG. Then at a minimum you can theoretically extract 50-55% more energy per unit volume of gasoline over CNG and LNG. In general combustion of liquids and solids occurs in the gas state, this means cleaner more efficient burns are achieved in gas state not liquid state.<br><br>cont",

Next is rarification, the ideal AFR of liquid gasoline is 14.5:1, whereas for gaseous gasoline it is theoretically 17.5:1. Resulting in a further minimum 20% increase in fuel efficiency over liquid gasoline. All you need to do to gasify gasoline is heat it up, or increase the volume massively before injection. This means you can automatically take a 15mpg highway v8 and bring it to about 21-23mpg by gasification alone, then a further 2-3mpg by AFR, giving at least 23-26mpg in theory. However, in extreme rarification you can save significantly more fuel, in some of the higher quoted AFRs you can theoretically reduce fuel consumption by 90%, this needs more study however. These extreme AFRs have only been quoted on carbureted engines AFAIK, the Tom Ogle and Charles Pogue engines were also carb engines. Gasification is slightly more difficult in fuel injected engines, but AFR rarification is even more difficult in injector engines.<br><br>cont",

You can restrict an engine by reducing the diameter of the air intake at the throttle body and reducing the total fuel volume flow per cycle. This concept is different from gasification, and it does result in power loss. However, the power loss is not as severe that it prevents your vehicle from driving mostly normally and still at highway speeds 65-75mph. You can double your fuel efficiency on high performance engines with this method, while also taking a big loss in acceleration performance however. Essentially a properly geared 4000lb vehicle only needs about 55-90hp and 100-150 ft lbs of torque to drive normally. For a 5.0l does v8, you can at most restrict the intake to roughly 1/2.6 of original and reduce fuel volume by a similar or slightly higher rate and still drive 75mph highway, but with 40mpg. If you combined restriction with gasification you might be able to achieve at least 50mpg on that same 5.0l v8. If you combined restriction with gasification and rarification, you might be able to achieve 170mpg and be able to drive at highway speeds with the same 5.0l v8. Lookup ThunderHead289 lawn mower carb videos on youtube to see an example of restriction efficiency taken to extremes. In theory restriction only works best on engines with a high performance output per displacement volume and good starting power, it does not work as good on smaller and less efficient engines, but restriction can work equally well on fuel injected engines as it can carb engines.",

This also means that the higher you rev the engine the air flow velocity also increase. The increased flow velocity at the aperture and through the smaller carb or air intake then enters a larger volume manifold and then a smaller volume combustion chamber, so the interaction is complex. The increased flow velocity also serves to more evenly disperse the fuel at the carb even at normal AFRs. The smaller carb essentially has a lower maximum possible CFM, and if you are reducing total fuel volume as well (which is very likely on a much smaller carb) you end up almost proportionally decreasing total air flow and total fuel volume flow. This results in lower hp and torque, but increased fuel efficiency. On a big carb that is being choked, the air is initially restricted and the pressure reduced, but the total fuel volume remains similar and the absolute diameter of the aperture prior to injection is also larger, resulting in a still higher total possible CFM than a smaller carb with much smaller diameters and volume off the bat. For a fuel injected engine, you can tune the total fuel volume on injection lower near proportionally to the reduced diameter throttle body, in theory you can take a 2.4l I4 3300lb coupe to 50mpg and be able to still drive at highway speeds. Heat is also not really an issue on restricted engines, but at worst you can add air vents in the hood and or a cooling fan and scoops.",

One can modify the crank to physically has a shorter in intake stroke than power stroke, adjust the valve timing so that air is either shut off early or reject back out later so the equivalent intake stroke is reduced, or the most simple of them all is put restriction on intake so the intake is always starved thus less air.<br>The compression ratio for compression is therefore less than the expansion ratio of the power stroke. In the diagram it is shown that the intake stroke is much shorter and begin left of the otto. This reduces the work done to compress the air.<br>In addition, less pressure left by the time exhaust valve open, which is wasted to exhaust pipe as pulse, which explains the noise reduction.<br>Less work is generated, but a lot more work compares to the work put in than before.",

On a fuel injected engine you have to tune the ECU to ignore performance and purposefully retard the air and fuel at the proportional ratio. Restriction alone will result in loss of engine power, but it can be tuned just right so that you have the minimum amount of power needed to run the gearbox effectively and normally. <br><br>This is basically proportional restriction in this video.

But the easiest way to perform restriction is simply reduce total fuel and air volume proportionally and starve the engine without stalling. Gasification is more complex, but it essentially is simply burning the fuel more efficiently in a gaseous state, which should give you up to at least 55% improved efficiency over liquid injected gasoline. Gas AFR is 17.5:1 resulting in more efficiency as well. AFR rarefication is also more complex, but essentially if you stop using gasoline as the coolant (wasting gas) and introduce another coolant like water vapor you can immediately improve efficiency on totally stock setups by that alone. This is what the water air bubbler does on the diagram, it forces a significantly higher amount of water vapor into the air stream of the intake process. In some studies introducing water to the air intake increase fuel efficiency by 13% and power by 5% on totally stock unmodified engines. Controlled direct injection engines can achieve custom AFRs of 25:1, these are modern setups though and not old carbs which is why the Ogle and Pogue AFR rarefication needs more study because they quoted AFRs as high as 90:1. In theory if you perform all of these things (gasification, higher AFR, restriction, water vapor intake etc) and get them to work together properly you can absolute get at least a maximum of 50-100 mpg on the same engine and drive at highway speeds, and theoretically you can double fuel economy without any loss in power. The simplest redneck setup though would be restriction and water vapor injection, without messing with gasification yet.",

Gasoline has never been gasified in commercial production engines by design. Gasoline has a still higher energy density than LPG is stored as a liquid under pressure and then becomes a gas prior to injection naturally because of the chemical properties of propane and butane. Gasoline is stored and injected as a liquid and is only gasified during the combustion cycle, during which auto manufacturers are actually injecting at least 40-70% too much fuel resulting in very high emissions and poor fuel efficiency. LPG is less efficient than CNG as well. When using the water air bubbler with partial gasification the &quot;plasmoid&quot; engines show pic related for exhaust emissions. In restricted engines the emissions output is also significantly reduced, but if you apply the water air bubbler and gasification as well the total emissions can drop even lower as you end up with almost a complete burn. <br><br>Tom Ogle in the late 1970s said the exact same thing. His carb reduced emissions to literally almost zero while his big 300 ci v8 was getting 100 mpg, no plasmoids needed. Auto manufacturers in the early 1970s gas crisis did make extremely slight restriction setups on engine which only improved fuel efficiency by about 20% at the most, when it is actually possible to more than double fuel efficiency with restriction alone (see ThunderHead289 lawn mower carb video). <br><br>Tom Ogle was likely killed at 26 years old or at least targeted because he went public with his gasification carb, it is reported he was offered 25 million USD for his carb design rights. He was shot under mysterious circumstances, survived, then four months later found dead under mysterious circumstances. <br><br>US Patent 4,177,779. <br><br>The Ogle system used a complex system of vacuum draw, filters, bubblers, and a feedback coil that fed hot engine coolant through a heater coil in the vapor tank to prevent vapor cooling and increase gasification prior to injection.",

Can you recommend some textbooks or articles for chaos theory, game theory, and pure mathematics? My friend just got admitted to a Bachelor of Sciences and they are studying Pure Mathematics; I want to get them some gifts (studies, student resources, learning materials) to celebrate. What resources have you guys used and what is best for a fairly advanced student who hasn&#039;t been in the milieu of university just yet? Thanks so much in advance. Sorry for being lazy and asking but my discipline is in the Arts.",

Estimation theory and signal detection are basically all about functions of random variables and conditional expectations (i.e., integrals conditioning on a sigma-algebra induced by a measurement). If you look into the research world for multi-target tracking, or signal detection theory, or information theoretic machine learning, it&#039;s all EEs, and measure theoretic mixture models are everywhere when you&#039;re looking at the cutting edge research. <br><br>There&#039;s even a big part of multi-target tracking research that uses random measure theory (specifically, random finite set trackers). Take a look at the probability hypothesis density filter if you want an example that uses random finite sets.<br><br>A lot of signal processing deals with Fourier analysis and Laplace transforms. It&#039;s pretty helpful to know how integrals work when you&#039;re doing applied Fourier analysis at a research level. Additionally, a lot of research level signal processing deals with finding optimal processes for determining the eigenvectors and eigenvaluesof random matrices, as well as determining error bounds for those estimates. This uses measure all the time. <br><br>Finally, if you&#039;re in the optimization and non-linear programming side of EE, L_p spaces and inner product spaces, and dual spaces (which you&#039;ll encounter in any decent measure course) are all super helpful.",

Linear algebra, number theory, analysis, whatever. Then, find the limits of your own knowledge of what you do know (i.e., maybe you remember some trig identities, but do you know calculus? Maybe you remember geometry, but how do you feel about taking inverses of real valued functions? Etc.) Then, try and bridge the gap slowly between yourself and whatever goal you have. If you want to learn linear algebra, look up a final exam from some class somewhere online, and study a textbook on your own until you find yourself able to answer the questions on said exam. You can repeat this process for more and more subjects as you go on. Also &quot;professor level math&quot; implies you want a PhD level knowledge. In which case, get a PhD.",

They outright refuse to mention their space activities most of the time, but there has been a few instances of NASA recognizing them, like the MRO imaging Zhurong but other than a few select instances they don&#039;t really talk about them despite their solid presence in space. It would be awkward for them to not congratulate China if they were to succeed in a major milestone like a Lunar landing, for example. Maybe in the future we&#039;ll have another &quot;Apollo-Soyuz&quot; moment, except it would be NASA astronauts shaking hands with CMSA taikonauts on the surface of the Moon.

This method involves taking many very short exposure images. By rapidly capturing these &quot;speckles&quot; of light and then combining them, astronomers can overcome the blurring effects of Earth&#039;s atmosphere, achieving incredibly high angular resolution. This allowed them to resolve the fainter companion star despite the blinding glare of Betelgeuse itself.<br>Betelgeuse is an incredibly luminous red supergiant, vastly outshining its companion. This makes it extremely difficult to distinguish a much fainter object so close to it.<br>While Hubble provides incredible clarity in space, even its visible light capabilities struggled to resolve such a faint object against Betelgeuse&#039;s immense brightness and glare. Past efforts with Hubble for Betelgeuse&#039;s companion were inconclusive, though they did help set limits on its size in some studies. <br>Chandra is an X-ray observatory. While the companion star is likely a young, active star that might emit X-rays, previous X-ray observations occurred at the wrong orbital phase for optimal detection or lacked the necessary deep exposure. Recent Chandra observations (May 2025) still didn&#039;t detect an X-ray source at Betelgeuse&#039;s position, providing constraints on the companion&#039;s X-ray luminosity, but confirming it as a low-mass young stellar object.",

You could have a guy wearing the newest known-good suit design on one fairing and four crash test dummies in experimental suits on the other side.

They allowed rough categorisations since they correlated well enough with task fitness, recursion and abstraction apparently have iq thresholds below which they&#039;re either impossible or much more challenging.<br>They aren&#039;t a perfect tool but various forms have been developed that provide an analysis of various cognitive tasks, with the more intense involving such tools as reaction boards. While there is a degree of task specialisation the evidence supports a general factor or G factor those who are good at one task also tend to excel at another dissimilar task (I think the original term was spearman&#039;s general factor of cognitive discrimination).<br>IQ tests are perhaps one of the best tests devised to try and estimate G, obviously a single number is much too simplistic to qualify your ability at a specific task but that would be where more specialised tests are best applied.<br>Although you can practice IQ tests to bump your scores higher there&#039;s a limit to your ability to raise your iq score and the results aren&#039;t persistent over time. Also the trainability of certain test components is variable with those more g loaded subtests being far harder to raise (for a wider issue with that see the problem of the so called Fllynn/Lynn effect). <br>Sorry for the digression I can&#039;t put what I wish to say into clear enough words.<br>If I you&#039;ll forgive me I can suggest a metaphor: It&#039;s like asking what&#039;s the value in measuring peoples&#039; heights systematically when you can clearly see who&#039;s taller by looking at them.

You just want me to assume stuff that doesn&#039;t happen does because you&#039;re a brainwashed cult retard and your entire faith system is based on countless blind faith beliefs and baseless assertions which you parrot like the dumb retard you are. You idiots will point to Darwin&#039;s finches (which are still finches) and a subset of those finches dying out because they couldn&#039;t get food and claim that proves evolution which requires new information by showing a culling of information. You idiots don&#039;t even understand procreation and DNA. You think mutations work like your gayfag sci-fi and comic book movies. You&#039;re all so fucking dumb. Get killed, faggot.",

They will ultimately use it to justify your genocide if they ever accumulate political power to attempt it. Which is why I have been coming for a decade warning you all and exposing what they are doing and how they do it. Their problem however, is their tactics only work on unsuspecting normies because they are too low IQ to actually have any kind of argumentation outside of just outright lying and calling people &quot;pol,&quot; &quot;schizo,&quot;&quot;racist&quot; so on and so forth. <br><br>These labels are very effective in the short term, as long as they can control the flow of information and the people they apply these labels cant defend themselves and expose what these people are doing (which was why Musk buying twatter was such a coup against them and he is now public enemy #1 even though he was a darling of the left for decades).

Why it isn&#039;t the dominant theory on how existence operates given the knowledge we have now is baffling, albeit i&#039;ve read more articles in recent years coming around to the idea.<br><br>Basically the old decrepit zones of the universe, likely to be in the centre of the universe decays first, black holes form, matter is consumed and these black holes expand. On the edge of the universe expansion continues but in (mostly) finite amounts limited to what energy was released in the big bang. This leads to a &#039;&#039;donut&#039;&#039; shaped universe in which nothing in the middle exists and nothing outside it exists. This goes on for eons as the livable universe stretches thin like a ring bubble underwater until the twilight moment our universe becomes so thin everything begins degrading apart as the black holes forming inside the ring and the greater abyss absorbs whats left spontaneously creating the &#039;&#039;white hole&#039;&#039; release of energy leading to another big bang.<br><br>We can still ponder how the universe came to be in its original iteration, but each subsequent &#039;&#039;big bang&#039;&#039; event has followed this rule.",

I kinda want to get into regenerative medicine just for reasons like this. With current technology, the option nearest in time would be to have a giant lab-grown schlong that would have to replace your current dingus via amputation and replacement. <br><br>There&#039;s also the issue of the inner portion of the penis that would make it difficult. If your lab-grown schmeat is 7&quot; in diameter while your current cock root is 4.5&quot; diameter, that would not only make the grafting difficult, but once it&#039;s together, that would be a weak point where it can&#039;t support itself very well. To make up for that, you&#039;d probably need some extra ligaments thrown in that aren&#039;t naturally present. Or maybe upgrade the current ones to some heavy duty models.<br><br>I could probably go on about this way more, but this is enough for one post.",

I tried making my own calculation based on Chinese costs (they have the lowest costs). Do you think they are reasonable?<br><br>I compared a nuclear power plant in a coastal Chinese province with utility-scale solar power sent from Inner Mongolia. These calculations are very simplistic, however they should give a rough indication. Only initial costs are considered, not operating costs, however the initial costs are the dominant cost for both nuclear and solar power.<br><br>To me it seems to explain why China is full speed ahead on both nuclear and solar. Nuclear might be cheaper, at least in some cases, however solar is easier to ramp up and deploy at scale. Solar also has the potential for significant further cost reductions.<br><br>Nuclear capacity cost is based on 3180MW thermal capacity and 1080MW net electrical capacity of HPR1000 at $2.8B per reactor. The capacity cost of a HPR1000 could conceivably be less in a thermal power application if it is decided to not include a turbine, generator, etc.<br>Nuclear capacity factor of 90% is based on the design target of HPR1000.<br>Capacity cost of solar (assume 17% decrease since 2022): https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202<wbr>401/08/WS659bec21a3105f21a507b285.h<wbr>tml<br>Assuming 12h of storage at 0.065$/Wh for solar and wind.

But that is incorrect beyond its acute perspective of a given matter. Nothing is actually as fixed as it seems. It is the matter of awareness of the properties within a given environment that is in turn, only based within our awareness. Such assumes too much in what can be measured or controlled, included or excluded as variables. For the average situation it is viable, but the wider you set the scale the higher the probability becomes to the extent even 0 is not indicative of impossibility. As a representation 0 is still a value until it is removed, yet the removal indicates a value. Therefore 0 can be greater than 0, as well as less than. And we can see this as 20&gt;10. And you might say this is a placeholder. But if it has no value it should not affect the value of what it is attached to. But if it is dependent on what it is attached to for value, then its value is that integer. So yes 0=\u221e.",

But the truth is that it is still ultimately, a value of zero just as much as it is any of the other values. Just because (You) want to assign abstract values arbitrarily, does not mean the value is anything other than what it truly is. And their actual value is indeed mutable just as much as you can assert 0 is mutable in the absolute. That&#039;s the entire premise I am getting at. The numbers, the objects, and the conditions are all mutable. And the potential you see as being able to be utilized as energy, was emergent from 0 as well. Whether you are atheist and think it was from a big bang, or religious and consider a creation in which a deity brought it forth, it still came from 0. And even if you think it was just a cycle or circle, the origin point or base stability at its center, is still a value of 0. <br><br>Embrace the null potential anon.",

But it also has another problem: explaining what the fuck the probabilities actually mean.<br>First, think of simple probabilities: 50/50. That&#039;s easy: you just need 2 universes. 60/20/20? Also easy, 3+1+1 universes. But wavefunctions hate your nice, easily countable probabilities. You&#039;re gonna get a shitload of irrational decimals that are completely incompatible with one another (so you can&#039;t like just use base pi, because another one is the square root of 2, another one is Euler&#039;s number etc). So you end up getting uncountably infinite universes. But what the fuck does that mean, physically? MWI adherents say that some branches are thicker &quot;in Hilbert space&quot;, so you&#039;re more likely to find yourself in them. But that does nothing to explain what the fuck happens *in physics*. What does it mean for a universe to be &quot;thicker&quot;? The math is pretty, and tells you nothing about reality.",

That section of the Guadalupe is heavily used for recreation, and as such the natural processes that would mitigate such flooding have been eliminated. Putting in manmade devices that will just lead to further degradation which will require more manmade solutions. Natural wetlands, a spread out and diverse floodplain, an established riparian zone, all would be much more effective over 50 years than a steel bank. There are no beavers in that section of the State, but you&#039;re onto the right idea.",

Even if it changes form. There are many variables and unknowns as well, such as simultaneous undetected dimensions in which energy can exist and interact with our reality but without the same temporal effects. Essentially however, there is a memory limitation on physical systems, the human brain and computers. In a typical human body there is a genetic potential to store roughly 150,000 years of human life data, or about 4,100 petabytes of digital data. One possible solution and unknown to this limit is quantum or non-local coherent memory storage that can be accessed anytime on que, a sort of aetheric storage capability of the universe itself. At the highest levels of technology it may not even be impossible to exist as a purely energy form of life, it is also possible to exist as a technological entity and be able to also create a physical biological body to inhabit and simultaneously exist in both forms. The possibilities are quite massive. I would not prefer to enter into a technological entity form unless I knew exactly how to create a physical biological body for me to escape if I so desired and delete any technological forms of my consciousness so it does not get copied and left behind to suffer. I do not doubt for one moment that the biological human form can live for hundreds or thousands of years at least with full genome level genetic engineering.",

If they say zero, they are either lying or are a narcissistic arsehole, which are undesirable traits for somebody managing your most important asset (your health). Even if it is true, a doctor with a kill count represents lessons learnt, and you want the most experienced doctor managing your health. Choosing between a doctor with zero patients deaths vs a doctor who has killed even just one of their patients is basically the same as eating tacos: you&#039;ll get much better, authentic tacos from the undocumented grandma under the bridge who has been making them for fifty years, rather than some new, hip and trendy fast-casual restaurant that just opened up. Whether I have the flu, an ingrown toenail, or I need a major surgery, I want my treating doctor to have some fucking bodies under their belt. Why would I risk my life with a lying, narcissistic jackass who refuses to acknowledge and learn from their mistakes? Doctors kill people all the time, but only the good doctors own it.",

TRT does have inherent risks even in a clinical setting as a treatment for genuinely low testosterone levels. 100\u2013200 mg/week of cypionate/enanthate may be a low dose by roider standards and it doesn&#039;t come from a shady lab so probably won&#039;t make you kick it at 30, but it isn&#039;t free of potential side effects and it does lower your life expectancy. Like with pretty much all pharmaceuticals, it&#039;s used because the benefits of treating low testosterone and its symptoms outweigh the risks. Saying TRT can be &quot;safely used&quot; is like saying chemo can be safely used. No, it can&#039;t, it fucking blows and it&#039;s bad for you. It&#039;s just that the alternative is even worse. There is no such trade-off if your test levels are fine, you&#039;re just exposing yourself to the side effects for no good reason. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 the reason is i wanna be big</span><br>We have better, safer treatments for body dysmorphia, start with therapy.

Humans like all primates led sedentary lives for most of their existence as a species. Working for 8 hours straight and sleeping for only 8 hours is abnormal. Running is absence of danger is abnormal, entails risk, and seldom would have been practiced by any primate other than early life play. <br><br>Obesity has two correlates. Low intelligence and mental illness. Lower intelligence means the brain has reduced caloric demands. Small brains use considerably less energy. That&#039;s why obesity exclusively encompasses low intelligence people. The other element is mental illness which makes them snack on and gobble stuff up all the time which explains their response to GLP1s (ie, behavioral modification by slowing their digestion down so much they feel sick when they try to munch).<br><br>High IQ individuals (150 plus) cannot get obese even if they try. James Watson notriously would burn through two dozen donuts in a day, on top of three hearty meals, several cups of cappuccino daily. Not the least bit overweight. No running, no gym, not overweight and he&#039;s still alive and well nearing 100 years old.<br><br>It isn&#039;t all doom and gloom. I would wager obese people lead better relative to their betters and seem to be much more adept at doing stuff and basic functioning. More energy. Usually hobbies.

Warfield\u2019s \u201cphone bill argument,\u201d for <br>example, notes that the purchase of meat is similar to paying a phone bill (2015). When you <br>purchase a chicken, some small fraction of your money may support a factory farm that <br>inhumanely raises chickens. Similarly, when you pay your phone bill, if employees at the phone <br>company eat chicken, some small fraction of your money may support a factory farm. In short, he <br>argues that in a complex economy, it is impossible to avoid some economic connection to factory <br>farming. This argument depends on a very different kind of economic uncertainty than does <br>Budolfson\u2019s scenario, but the result of the critique for consequentialist arguments about consumer <br>action are similar. The response to both, moreover, depends on an \u201cexpected impact\u201d argument, <br>since consumer omniscience is impossible.<br>The implication is that any argument against meat purchasing must be able to distinguish <br>between the causal connections that tie both the chicken purchase and the phone bill to the <br>industrial farm. Warfield notes that a consequentialist cannot differentiate between these events <br>by examining the intent of the agent, since the morality of the action needs to depend only on the <br>results. More broadly, Warfield calls for a broad consideration of possible impacts. He notes that <br>there could be feedback mechanisms in the economy, such that decreased consumption by one <br>person resulted in increased consumption by another. In particular as one group of people <br>consumes less meat, this could lower the price of meat, thereby encouraging others to consume <br>more (Warfield 2015, 159). The picture he paints is of an economy with so many connections that",

His strategy, instead, is to <br>express a general lack of confidence in a person\u2019s ability to present any simple causal story. He <br>argues that the complexity of economic interactions requires one of two responses. Either ethicists <br>give up on causal stories about how consumer actions impact production, or else we give reasons <br>why an action like buying meat has a particular set of consequences that are unique in quality or <br>magnitude. <br>Responding to Warfield requires that we first concede part of his argument: the economy <br>is extremely complex and most economic transactions could, therefore, be connected to animal <br>agriculture. Usually, however, these connections are trivial. Since most purchases result in income <br>for some other person, and most people consume at least some meat from factory farms, economic <br>purity is impossible. This is an important ethical observation. If one\u2019s ethical intuition is that a <br>person who buys chicken once a month and a person who buys chicken once each day are morally <br>similar, then Warfield\u2019s argument compellingly reminds us that in our economic system, even the <br>most devoted vegan could be in that once-a-month category.<br>For a consequentialist, however, the magnitude of the impact does matter, and Warfield\u2019s <br>argument does not prevent us from making important distinctions. There is good reason to believe, <br>for example, that purchasing a chicken has a much larger impact on the chicken industry than does <br>paying a phone bill. Moreover, paying a phone bill probably has a negligible effect on the chicken <br>industry, similar to that of a toothbrush purchase, or the purchase of any other unrelated good.",

In light of this, we can rephrase the argument against meat buying in the following way: it is unethical to purchase meat because the expected impact of a <br>meat purchase on animal well-being is worse than any other comparable purchase. <br>This alternative phrasing of the argument requires making an empirical claim, but <br>importantly, many of the effects that Warfield thinks might be relevant are empirical in nature, and <br>can be measured using standard economic data. In order to respond to Warfield\u2019s skepticism, <br>however, we must make a distinction between what is observable on average, and what is <br>observable in a particular case. It is impossible to know, with certainty, whether one is materially <br>supporting an industrial farm when one pays a phone bill. However, we can tell whether, on <br>average, paying a phone bill results in more money for industrial farms. This unpredictability at <br>the individual level should not dissuade us from consequentialist reasoning, for two reasons. First, <br>noise at the level of an individual observation is perfectly consistent with strong causal effects <br>overall. Imagine trying to measure the height of water in a bucket before and after dipping a cup <br>in and removing some of the water. The ripples from the disturbance make any depth measurement <br>at a particular place and time highly uncertain, and the complexity of the wave patterns make each <br>measurement difficult to predict. However, the average outcome will still be easily predictable and <br>causally related to the amount of water removed. Second, the standard \u201cexpected impact\u201d argument <br>for abstaining from meat requires only that the average impact is predictable. This means that <br>economic complexity, as long as it conforms to a broader predictable order, is not a challenge to <br>consequentialist moral reasoning.",

Let us assume that a <br>customer has $100 to use as they wish, and are interested in comparing the impact of two different <br>purchases on animal lives. If the money is spent paying a phone bill, about $75 will likely end upas wages for a worker.9 Moreover, in the United States, roughly 2% of new income is spent on <br>food,10 and for every 1% increase in food expenditures, the average household spends 0.04% more <br>money on meat and eggs (Alston and Okrent 2012, 20). Given aggregate food consumption <br>statistics,11 this means that, on average, $100 spent on a phone bill results in close to 1.6 cents <br>more money spent on meat and eggs.12 Spending that $100 on chicken will have a similar indirect <br>effect, but this effect is negligible. The point is, that even without figuring out the impact of <br>spending on actual production levels, we can estimate that the phone bill expense has a total impact <br>on factory farming that is four orders of magnitude smaller than the same expenditure on chicken.<br><br>The share of national income that goes to labor varies over time, between 70 and 85% (Bivens <br><br>2015).<br>10 Food consumption expenditures increase only a small amount as people become richer (Regmi <br>and Seale 2010, 11).<br>11 The average household income in the U.S. is around $50,000, and people in the U.S. spend close <br>to 11% of their income on food, on average, and 2.88% on meat and eggs.

It&#039;s a pretty good instinct for figuring out basic laws of physics on a caveman level, it got us very far, but it always degenerates into nonsense superstitions beyond that, all centered on the core idea of there being a rigidly finite amount of good juju we are dispensed from the heavens every day, sometimes shared with other people in a spiritual zero-sum game. This is the mechanism behind almost all religious rituals and superstitions, especially sacrifices and fasts.<br><br>The exact dissonance comes from trying to project the generally sound idea of energy conservation onto an arbitrary moral plane. If said moral plane is not perfectly aligned with physical and biological reality, and I mean mercilessly objective to the point of scary and alien, you are inevitably going to believe and do some really stupid shit. Basically, the same instinct that allowed you to reason correctly about things like lightning, and would eventually lead you to discover something called the &quot;electromagnetic field&quot; - here it is a complete waste of time as no amount of nofap science is ever going to lead you to discover the waifuvaginal field. Even if some notion of scoring and conservation can be intuitively applied to morals (and indeed it&#039;s the basis of them), it really doesn&#039;t rub well with purely victimless crimes that do nothing more than personally offend you, which is what we&#039;re dealing with here.<br><br>One thing that cannot be ignored here is Americans.

Should we go with 50% since the theory is either true or false, or should we consider a set of theories and assign each the same probability, because we do not know which one is true?<br>Should we even start from geographical grounds and give each region of Earth the same chance?<br>- How can we calculate the probability of distribution based on the assumption that the Out of Africa theory is true? Most likely, we would expect most fossils, especially the oldest ones, to be found in Africa, right?<br>- Should we calculate different P(A|B) values for various empirical data sets B (B_1, B_2 etc.) and then combine them, or should we develop one big formula for all?<br><br>What do you think, follow /sci/tards?",

EVERY single thing foids accuse us of is pure projection. The porn addictions, the unrealistic expectations, everything. If you genderswapped the average foid&#039;s taste in males, it would be be something along the lines of wanting that F-cup anorexic blonde that the entire 90s were spent SCREAMING at us to not like. Which we DID listen to. Same with every other instruction thrown at us. While we were busy receiving an accelerated course in being civilized, the other half of the population was busy being told they can now do whatever the fuck they want.
