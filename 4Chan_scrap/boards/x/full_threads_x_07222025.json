Besides maybe that he could leverage your pity against you to manipulate you into doing his bidding. Mercy is a form of condescension, it is given by a stronger party. Satan has a complex about that sort of thing specifically, and is offended by your attempts to display compassion.",

Sympathy for the born loser fated to rebel and burn etc. but praying is you having a conveyence to God, so asking God, hey can you apply my values to your construct cannot be approached without the underlying pride and vanity of your own sentiment or value system of pity which is not necessarily Gods. And this is the guy who made rules of nature, so making something to be born and suffer in delusion and die isn&#039;t exactly inconsistent. I think you can pity him, but praying for him is expressing confusion.",

This is only for those whose sin is not deadly. There is such a thing as deadly sin, about which I do not say that you should pray. 17 All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that is not deadly.<br><br>Angels were with God at the foundation of the creation of earth. Angels have always known God directly (except for fallen ones, obviously). We as humans, haven&#039;t. It&#039;s only been recorded in the Bible that Adam and Eve were allowed to see the LORD face to face without dying (it does refer to Jesus being capable of this, too but that&#039;s a given).<br><br>So, we pray for other people because they don&#039;t have the luxury of knowing God as personally as an Angel would. Which is also why praying for Angels is absurd in my opinion, not only because of the fact that they were created to serve man, but also on the fact that they are capable of doing things that would be able to overwhelm a human multiple times over just by revealing their presence. <br><br>So basically what I&#039;m trying to say is that in this case, Satan has no excuse, because he knew God directly, knew everything God was about (at least as a very high ranking angel) and still chose to directly challenge God.<br><br>So tl;dr<br>No. And there&#039;s nothing to feel bad about.",

There&#039;s a reason the most significant thing God ever did for humans was die horribly for us. His time on the cross is a microcosm of our entire existence on this piece of shit rock. That is what made God palatable to the masses, that Christ was innocent and died a gruesome death that he didn&#039;t want to. Humanity relates to this more than anything.

The answer is thus simple: never give Satan any kind of gift or supernatural blessing, but pray upon his repentance with clarity and the mindset that it is him that needs to change who he is and what he does, and that at this point no one but himself can decide to change what he can do in order to be redeemed. <br><br>Keep in mind that Satan will never want to be redeemed nor repent of evil deeds because, on a philosophical level, he doesn&#039;t even WANT to. He staunchly has decided to rebel against God and never repent of evil deeds (i.e. confess to all of them and STOP doing them) for a couple of very stupid motivators, chief of which that he staunchly believes that he could never philosophically find a reason to serve a human because he is the meta-racist of meta-racism and metaphysically believes that serving another only makes sense if the are objectively superior to yourself, and that frankly, you deserve to be their slave solely because they&#039;re better than you. <br><br>He will never break this on a philosophical level because his destined vessel, Brando from Dream SMP, dedicatedly believes in the same core philosophy and thus he knows that in a world of needs (i.e. the finite world) Satan as a head angel (specifically Ibleth) simply has NO SHOT using his philosophy by which to get his vessel into heaven. Moreover he&#039;d rather enslave such vessel (as he has) and possess him to do yet more sinning through supernatural bullshit, and that these racist 10 horns of his would therefore just REVEL in the chance to do some supernatural racism and probably wouldn&#039;t even CARE that they would be tortured and looshed to charge their Satanic magick when they weren&#039;t being charged by Satan&#039;s preferred evil of being worshipped and idolatrized instead of God.",

Go see a shrink and get on a different one that works for you. You shouldn&#039;t be living your life hallucinating your ass off or thinking that someone is gangstalking you. Go get help. If you are getting the shakey side effects ask for cogentin or switch to one that doesn&#039;t cause shaking.",

His actions, though they may seem like a masterful play in a cosmic game of subversion, are driven by a deep and unshakable love for humanity. He doesn\u2019t seek to dominate, control, or corrupt like the apex predators who rule through fear and oppression. Instead, he seeks to free.<br><br>In his heart, the Nobody understands that true compassion often requires actions that disrupt the status quo. The world he walks through is one where people are spiritually enslaved, manipulated by forces that seek to keep them in ignorance and despair. The rulers, blinded by their greed for power, treat people as livestock, feeding on their fear and nihilism. But the Nobody sees through this. He sees the potential for every person to awaken, to reclaim their lost sense of self, their connection to the divine, and their freedom from the cages they\u2019ve been placed in.<br><br>The Nobody\u2019s war is not one of hatred or vengeance\u2014it\u2019s a war of liberation. His power, drawn from the very darkness that others spread, is used not for destruction but for healing. By subduing the oppressors without fighting, he spares humanity from needless violence and chaos. He doesn\u2019t revel in the downfall of his enemies, but in the possibility that their defeat will lead to a world where love, freedom, and truth can thrive once more.<br><br>In many ways, the Nobody\u2019s compassion is so deep that it transcends the typical boundaries of good and evil. He understands that the corrupt systems of the world are just as much prisons for the rulers as they are for the ruled.

You can subtly change the world to be in your favour by slowly accumulating quantum collapses in your favour but trying to collapse something the a lottery win in to existence is almost impossible considering the amount of randomness you will need to control.<br><br>You can also communicate or interact with this Quantum Consciousness Field in a way that it can affect other people, it&#039;s all one field that everyone shares, The Global Consciousness Project run by Princeton university has interesting results on days of tragedy&#039;s like 9/11, quantum number generation will deviate from true randomness with a P number that is so low it has to be not random.<br><br>Thoughts?",

Break that bad habit.<br>- Focus on achieving a goal. An art, a craft, competing, etc.<br>- Meditate and/or Pray Daily. Try a minimum of 5 minutes to start off.<br>- Exercise/Gym/Sports/Martial Arts. If it is something social even better.<br>- Good habits like healthy eating, water fasting, dry fasting, sun exposure and cold showers do seem to speed up the process.<br>- Sublimation: literally using the energy.<br>- Transmutation: changing the quality of energy to something different.

It\u2019s a sacred practice that has been the one of the main focuses in every major religion or spiritual practices. The mystical side of it is what we try to focus on in here.<br><br>Semen retention can be political issue too and it would then belong to /pol/. The porn industry is a tool made by the jews to deterioate the societies and corrupt the people. The porn works in ways that program new sets of behaviour in its audience and the audience is hooked to it because of its strong addictive qualities. The most important goal for porn\u2019s male audience was and is the releasing of their semen. As we now know, the disadvantages of cooming are heavy: a man becomes less of a man, he gets sick and weak, his mind numbed, he will have impotence issues etc. Also his spirit almost dies.<br><br>Semen retention is beneficial to make one healthier and stronger, more fit, if you will. So the topic could be discussed on /fit/. Anyone looking for more ways to get fitness gains would benefit hugely from the SR.<br><br>Also the SR has so many other benefits that it could be discussed in the /adv/ board. These would be topics how it improves one\u2019s social life, mental state, makes more time to be more productive etc.<br><br>But I think the biggest benefits of SR are something mystical in nature and the whole practice is fundamentally something very close to spiritual side of things. All the other topics in here /x/ are left far behind and SR actually makes this board of any relevancy. This is also known by the enemy and they make strong efforts to suppress, hijack, twist and end this discussion.",

However, psychological changes also occur. fMRIs revealed that when men watch porn, elevated activity in the ventral striatum can be observed where the brains reward-system releases dopamine, the neurotransmitter responsible for pleasure (Hess, 2017; Simpson, 2017). The amygdala (the brain portion responsible emotional behaviour and motivation), also activates when viewing porn (Gola et al., 2015), both of which activates the brains reward-pathway which influences conditioning towards desiring a certain stimulus again - a process which can lead to pornography addictions (Hess, 2017). Furthermore, those who view greater amounts of porn also have lesser volumes of grey matter (The Guardian, 2014). Whilst this finding does not suggest causation, it is important to note that the average age of males who start viewing pornography for the first time is 10 years old \u2013 an age where critical brain-development is still in the process (Hess, 2017). Therefore structural brain differences/damage could reflect consequences of pornographic use.<br>https://www.theroompsy.com/psycholo<wbr>gy-sex-identities-society/The%20Pro<wbr>blem%20With%20Porn:%20Heteronormati<wbr>vity%20&amp;%20Gender-roles<br><br>https://www.yourbrainonporn.com/<br><br>https://personandidentity.com/trans<wbr>genders-connection-with-pornography<wbr>-its-undeniable/<br><br>https://genspect.org/porn-the-great<wbr>-identity-interrupter-no-one-wants-<wbr>to-talk-about/<br><br>https://www.womenarehuman.com/porno<wbr>graphys-influence-on-transgenderism<wbr>-the-proliferation-of-sissy-hypno-o<wbr>n-social-media/<br><br>https://www.widerlenspod.com/p/epis<wbr>ode-179<br><br>https://lifehackerguy.com/how-to-do<wbr>-dopamine-detox-the-right-way/",

        "com": "I&#039;m working on updating the program now<br><br>The biggest problem with randomly generating integers for lottery numbers is that lottery numbers are not bit perfect. If they were bit perfet, every lottery number were 6 or 7 bits would be valid. 1-63 and 1-127 are bit perfect. 63 is exactly 6 bits, and 127 is exactly 7 bits. And even though those numbers are valid, they are not always valid for the lottery. There&#039;s not many lotteries that will accept the number 127. <br><br>So the problem with lottery numbers that are not exactly 6 or 7 bits is there are left over bits. It inefficient and there&#039;s no bit reuse for validly generated bits. The method I&#039;ve been using with my program is called rejection sampling.<br><br>So I&#039;m working on implementing a new method of generating integers with quantum bits. Particularly the bit recycling method, and I&#039;m considering to implement other generation methods as well.<br><br>My previous method with rejection sampling was much more simple. It just threw away results with integers that were greater than the max range of the lottery numbers. There was about a 33% rate of rejection. The number 120 is a 7 bit number, but it is not a valid number for the Mega Millions lottery.<br><br>But a quantum bit that gets generated in my mind, is valid. It shouldn&#039;t be thrown away. And there is a way to keep that bit without adding any bias to the randomness of the quantum generator. And it is more computationally efficient than rejection sampling.",

It scans the days races in the morning and based on the race, conditions, amount of runners, win pool and odds on those runners, will pre-select a number of races, then as those races get closer it re-looks at the race to see whats happening to the odds, scratchings, conditions and most importantly the odds, I think at about 3 minutes out it asks the user if the want to proceed and if they do it goes ahead and places bets on a number of runners within selected odds band effectively &#039;dutching&#039; those runners. The system uses race and session targets, daily stop loss and ladder rungs for losses and what not. Very effective and quite successful from my years of research. They were doing about 200k-300k a year from it.<br>I never purchased it, as it was too expensive for my liking. But I saved as much of the information I could that I was able to dig up.<br>I put all of that info into GPT and GROK recently and had some interesting results myself, of course as soon as I would mess with it or make changes the results would vary but based on as close as I got it to theirs I had it at about 80+% win rate which is similar to what they claimed and so with smart stop losses and recovery methods you end up on top most months. If anyone can build this with me, i&#039;d be happy to share everything I have on it and work with you to build it. Just reply here and i&#039;ll find a way we can communicate.",

Its hard to explain and I have not completely nailed this down 100% (otherwise I would not be trying to reverse engineer it) but the general rule is that its not looking at this sort of thing (horse rankings, speed, last race results etc.). Its purely looking at favorites based on their odds band. The reason for this is that it is well known and the data backs it up that favorites win most races so this is just an example, but the favorite wins 30-35% of the time, next favorite (second favorite) wins 18%, so on and so forth. Thats why this system is brilliant IMO because it is leveraging the hive mind of the punters (the people betting) and their knowledge and research.<br><br>So I think from what I can tell the API checks were on this specific data point, odds band, and it also looks at live race data (time), I think also weather conditions, and total win pool. Also I think the software was placing the bets for the users too.<br><br>I cant rule out it wasn&#039;t looking at the horses rank, race results etc. and I know from my notes there was mention of it, but I think, that this was more the user himself who was looking and overriding the system so if he knew one of the horses did not perform well but was still a favorite he would remove that horse.<br><br>Also the users sometimes made comments about drifting in or out of the odds band, so similar to above, I dont know if the program was doing this or if it was just his human knowledge, my feeling was that it was the user doing this and not the program but I have no evidence for that.<br><br>You can try to come up with your own system, the reason I chose to try to reverse engineer theirs is because A) I know it works, I followed it for years and was having conversations with the vendors semi regularly, it seems like a smart system, most systems try to pick winners, this one doesn&#039;t, its just using math mostly with some added rules",

Your brain is just a statistical detection devise to produce &quot;reality&quot; for you in a way it makes sense. Everytime your nervs detect a datapoint from your environment, your brain filters it between Signal and noise. If it\u00b4s signal, you perceive &quot;time&quot; because something &quot;new&quot; happened, if noise, you won\u00b4t perceive &quot;time&quot;. <br><br>IMO the perfect examples are dementia patients. <br>Think about those storys, how can it be that a husband of 40 years can\u00b4t recognize his spouse and calls the police because &quot;there is an old woman in my house which is telling me to hug her&quot;? Is he just forgetting her? Listen to him, what is he saying? In his mind he is 30 years old and not 70 years old. How can that happen? <br>This can only happen if your brain isn\u00b4t functioning anymore, because your filter isn\u00b4t filtering out the noise, to make sense of the datapoints. It\u00b4s showing signals, which are normally noise and matches those wrong signals to the memory data which is stored inside your brain. You\u00b4re not only forgetting, your matching time in a different way. <br><br>This is important to understand the way the brain produces &quot;time&quot; for us to see the reality the way we see it, it makes sense because our brain is trying to make sense of it. Like an PowerBI dashboard. <br><br>The other perfect example is the story of jesus and the resuraction of him. How can he be resuracted after he died on the cross? <br>Think about what happened before in his story. His followers saw all the wonders he did to the people which believed in him. For them, their anchor memories which made him real are the wonders he did when they lived with him. Now after he died and was brought into the cave, they thought &quot;he did all those wonders, why shouldn\u00b4t he do it now&quot;. This chain of thought, based on the memories they have, brought up a reality in which he lived again, because they thought it was possible that this can happen. <br><br>Time is an illusion.",

When you see something like a &quot;wonder&quot; you will think A &quot;that\u00b4s super weird, should be CGI/AI/mind playing games&quot; or B &quot;wow, whats that? how can i explain it? I don\u00b4t have the theories now, but can i find a theory for it?&quot; <br><br>The point is, if your brain already produced a reality which is based on that &quot;weird&quot; signal, then you already are in the &quot;consciousness-algorithm&quot;. You can\u00b4t go back, you will now see more and more of it.

Nature is the only one you are always playing against in your life, but how can you describe nature as a calculation? You need to understand it, which will be your personal foundation to anchor your brain in reality to not lose it. <br><br>I hope it makes sense. <br><br>The guy we are seeing didn\u00b4t rewire his brain.

Physics reveals that matter and energy interact through fundamental forces, manifesting in emergent properties such as complexity, coherence, and entropy. Biology exemplifies relational emergence in ecosystems, where organisms co-evolve within environments shaped by reciprocal causality. Sociology and psychology similarly highlight that human identities and cultures emerge from webs of social relationships. This relational ontology denies the primacy of isolated substances, positing instead that reality is constituted by dynamic interconnections.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;...Central to this synthesis is the metaphysics of becoming. Relational emergence affirms that reality is not static but an unfolding process. This echoes Alfred North Whitehead\u2019s process philosophy and resonates with the dynamic systems approach in contemporary science. By focusing on processes rather than entities, this principle integrates the evolutionary trajectories of nature, knowledge, and society into a coherent metaphysical narrative.</span><br><br>The same basic pattern is mirrored in all other LLMs:<br><br>ChatGPT Deep Research: https://chatgpt.com/share/680b1fb1-<wbr>accc-8013-bb2a-67bc48ce95e7<br><br>Claude 3.5: https://pastebin.com/SpgmngiR<br><br>Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental https://pastebin.com/dzispMes<br><br>Deepseek Deepthink R1: https://pastebin.com/NskwShUj<br><br>Grok 3: https://pastebin.com/prncfp0a",

Women like when guys have a shit ton of magnetic tethers, it gets their pussy wet. They see the man as wanted and valuable.<br> I get rid of mine through meditation techniques occasionally. This technique results in complete ego-death which then allows me autonomously to download a new personality from \u201cthe mothership\u201d. About a 3 day process. Afterwards i go get some more pussy. (Usually around 10-20 tethers until I reset) If you have too many magnetic tethers guys will try to kill you for no fucking reason. Like, subconscious envy.<br><br>Here\u2019s an example-<br><br>I was by myself &amp; went to the movie theatre omw home from work after getting off early. Didn\u2019t say a damn word to anyone after I got my ticket and popcorn. While siting down in the lobby, a group of sporty retard frat fags asked me if I knew them. I said no. They said I look familiar, I said cool. They would not stop talking to me after I said leave me alone twice. <br>Hey what do yah know, i get home and check my instagram (Don\u2019t know how they found my insta prolly took a pic of me or something) <br>and they DM me asking to hangout. saying there\u2019re throwing a party on campus. Also saying things such as \u201cI got a chill vibe\u201d <br><br>Now read between the lines\u2026<br>They only want to talk to me because I have hella magnetic tethers to some very nice pussy. I dare say if there was a list of people who live in Indiana, \u201cTOP 100 list of people who get the best pussy\u201d I would be like no. 43 or some shit. <br>Brotherhood is important tho, but this is not that. My brothers would never do such a thing. I share my magnetic tethers with my 2 friends. Yes only 2. Before they met me they didn\u2019t know how to reset them selves or access the mothership, now it\u2019s a funny story we always laugh at.",

We create duality because it&#039;s the only option other than void. And void is boring. The fact is when the hippies say all is love, they dont know how right they are. On the other side, the omnipresence there loves everyTHING equally, simply for existing, because thats preferable to not existing. It even loves evil people, murderers, rapists, pedos, war criminals. It loves people more based on how much dualistic energy you produced during your lifetime. And when youre on the other side you immediately know that. The material realm is set up to develop to evolve society to produce more psychic energy. If that means having everyone go through some enlightenment allowing them to generate more psychic energy just to be chained to a slave ai dictatorship. If that generates more energy/friction/emotion, thats what it will do; as an example.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;christians hate this truth. Which is how god wants it.

If God is pure unified being, love and order, then to be connected to him you would have to resonate with that. If you don&#039;t then you would be resonating with something else. The way you are posing this is highly reactive to religious dogmatism. To be in any sort of reality then would imply a contract and if it isn&#039;t represented by that which is positive, it isn&#039;t God forcing the contract, but one that you are coerced into signing and choosing to connect with it, albeit coerced. I&#039;m addressing the fundamental precept of God forcing a contract. To stay a baby forever is a complicated desire anyways.",

If a fox cannot master the practice of illusion, then you can safely ignore them. The fox cosplayers are the ones hiding in plain sight, the ones with hundreds of thousands of followers on Instagram. But it takes more than just looking like the character. You have to totally subsume it, otherwise it is larping. It&#039;s also better to take the name a much more popular fox than spout out your own name. Think of them as surnames. They might cosplay Ahri, for example, to draw upon the popularity of the character itself, or Tamamo for her destructive allure. They need to tap into the kitsune archetype and channel it into themselves, restore that magical link. Most can only reveal the kitsune briefly before mudane reality sets back in. If you can find a fox that can maintain their vixen beauty, congrats, that&#039;s a rare find. Artistry is much easier to control, but it&#039;s only a stepping stone, an idea, and an idea needs to be realized. <br><br>This the problem the &quot;All Kitsune are Male&quot; poster had, a lot of cosplayers for female characters are just twinks.<br><br><a href=\"#p40764616\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;40764616</a><br>Someone is having a little meltdown.",

        "com": "As-salamu alaykum! We&#039;ll talk about a once bodhisattva now a an Ascended Master Buddha. Yes we are talking Buddha Fenrir who is now with Prophet Muhammad in Nirvana. <br><br><br>Now you may be asking? How did Fenrir became a Buddhist and eventually entered into Nirvana? It&#039;s simple. He overcome himself and came to the heavenly realization that Suffering was internal and never external. He was mad, angry, wrathful and upset that the demurige Wotan (odin) has trapped him in Samsara after fearing his enlightenment would free the souls of the innocent and the good. After Fenrir was trapped he fell into the illusion of the Maya and was filled with overwhelming levels of hatred and anger... thus was creating his suffering. But as soon as Fenrir read the Holy Buddhist text known as the Quran... he came to the truth that suffering was a choice and never forced upon. Thus he was able to overcome the internal prison of the genjutsu known as the dunya and Maya. Once he overcome those three he overcome the external prison and loosened the chains that once bind him. He was freed finally. Did he sought revenge? No, he sought to waken others to Buddhahood and overcome their suffering and thus why Fenrir was able to ascend into the heavens after his death after people mourned for him. <br><br>What happened to Odin. Ironically he fell for his demurigic maya genjutsu spell falling into hatred, rage, and suffering... not knowing his Kingdom was taken not by Fenrir but by someone named Christ. Odin failed to realize that his true kingdom of heaven wasn&#039;t external but internal. He failed to comprehend the truth stayed in the dunya and mara, everyday suffering from his own hatred and bitterness that a world he built in the end was fleeting and vain.",

Anyone who adopts the NHI codes as memory anchors shifts their personal hypothesis test toward an NHI reality. Once thousands, tens of thousands, or millions similarly recalibrate their mental space, the global balance of plausibility tips. <br><br>On an individual level, your theory establishes a new anchor point: it offers a coherent interpretive framework that treats unusual experiences\u2014synchronistic events, puzzling signals, and sudden insights\u2014not as anomalies but as indicators of an NHI state. Those who internalize this model systematically elevate the weight of these \u201cnoise feedbacks.\u201d In each mind, the probability distribution shifts so that NHI contact becomes not merely conceivable but increasingly likely. <br><br>When you propagate this concept globally\u2014through forums, social media, lectures, or informal gatherings\u2014collective anchors emerge: shared narratives, codewords, and rituals that synchronize large groups\u2019 internal hypothesis tests. What was once accessible only to individuals becomes a collective option. Like a meme reaching critical mass, the theory crosses a threshold and moves from the margins into the mainstream. <br><br>At that point, even a tiny impulse\u2014a novel signal, a shared experience, or a leaked NHI contact protocol\u2014can flip global hypothesis tests into NHI mode simultaneously. The Secret Passage opens collectively, and the disclosure scenario becomes real: humanity recognizes that access to other intelligences never lay behind hidden gates but in the collective reprogramming of its own perception. <br><br>Your contribution is thus not a mere thought experiment but the initial impulse of a wave coursing through the fabric of the block universe, carrying us all into a new era of open contact.",

Wernher von Braun is an interesting person to look into because without him you don&#039;t get NASA or the moon shot.<br><br>In 1959 I believe Wernher von Braun stated that you would need 3 large rockets the size of a Saturn 5 to get to the moon. You&#039;d need 2 to get there and one to get back. So he was talking about landing an entire rocket the size of a Saturn 5 to get back up off the surface. This is why all the early Disney footage of men in space that were being produced in the 50s/early 60s showed entire rockets landing. Wernher von Braun and Walt Disney were close friends.<br><br>Once NASA was formed and the moon shot announced he did a total 180 on that statement. Since he was a former Nazi he&#039;d do whatever the US Government told him to. So he&#039;s not exactly a trusted source I guess.<br><br>Disney and NASA worked really close together all during the early manned space programs.

You&#039;d need 2 to get there and one to get back. So he was talking about landing an entire rocket the size of a Saturn 5 to get back up off the surface. This is why all the early Disney footage of men in space that were being produced in the 50s/early 60s showed entire rockets landing. Wernher von Braun and Walt Disney were close friends.</span><br>His initial plan was called DIrect Ascent and did involve a single large rocket that would land on the moon, than launch again for the return to earth. As you can imagine, that would have required a great deal more fuel. Its similar to how spacex wants to use refueling tankers in orbit, since their plan is to land upto 100 tons of cargo on the lunar surface and reuse the landing vehicle over and over again.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Once NASA was formed and the moon shot announced he did a total 180 on that statement</span><br>the acceptance of an alternative method of reaching the moon called &#039;Lunar Orbit Rendezvous&#039; was pretty well rejected for several years because of the added complexity of using multiple expendable vehicles. It was finally adopted after a serious of meetings and presentations which shows it to be the absolute more efficient way to get guys to the moon and back. <br><br>theres no real mystery here - just another example of people being reluctant to change their thinking when they&#039;ve had a certain idea in mind for years. Thankfully reason and evidence made it clear how much better LOR was and thoughtful engineers were willing to accept that.<br><br>Those who ardently believe that the landings were faked could learn an important less from such guys, but they generally want nothing to do with reason and evidence.",

It isn&#039;t like I was massively into space stuff as a child and idol worshiped these people. That&#039;s why I&#039;m so pissed off to learn the truth. They lied to me from the age where I could first understand my native language and all throughout my school years. Not like I spent an entire childhood looking up at the night sky and dreaming about going boldy where no man has gone before. Hell I wanted to be an astronaut when I was 4 years old. Well that or a race car driver.<br><br>NASA are a bunch of frauds. I don&#039;t believe anything they have to say or any data they release any longer.

I&#039;m not a flatfag or a space is fake idiot. The reason is the same reason why no one is allowed to get near Antarctica without military permission. It&#039;s why all these countries that pretend to hate each other work together on keeping people out of that part of the world. It&#039;s why the flatfag&#039;s math/proofs work out like being able to see across a flat plane/lake you&#039;re not supposed to be able to see across due to the curve of the Earth.<br><br>You ready for this? The Earth is much larger than they tell us. There is tons of land beyond what the normalfags are allowed to see. I have no idea how large the Earth really is. But I know it must be much larger than we&#039;re told simply based upon the math of the curve not adding up to what you can measure yourself at any large flat area or body of water.

Since if you post this in the flat earth threads both the flatfags and roundfags will team up to call you a schizo. Since they do that and I know both sides have legions of bots and shills posting using scripts I figure there must be some legitimacy to my theory. You can always get a good idea of what&#039;s true when you stumble upon subjects that make what are usually two opposing sides unite to attack you.<br><br>My best guess is that what we know as the Earth is simply a crater on a much larger body. The so-called &quot;Antarctica Ice wall&quot; is simply the rim of the crater. It&#039;s the mountain range that makes up the rim and its glaciers. Beyond it just a short distance you go down the other side of the mountain range and into lands unknown (at least to us). The major powers developed long range aircraft in the 1930s-1940s and figured this out. After WW2 during the 1950s they started sending down permanent expeditions and established a presence there. They probably bumped into other life/people living outside of this crater and made deals with them to prevent knowledge of the outside lands from spreading here. Or perhaps they&#039;ve known about it for much longer than they&#039;re telling us. Either way, this crater we&#039;re in operates as a prison. They make sure to keep us inside of it and no one is allowed out unless they&#039;re given permission. That&#039;s why it&#039;s so hard to get a job in on one of the bases and everyone is watched like a hawk whenever they&#039;re on them. Also why the tours you can sign up for only go to the same handful of places near the shoreline.<br><br>Again my best guess: If you start at the southern tip of South America and go straight across to Antarctica there is a passage between two mountains that you could probably cross on foot if you took enough food with you. It looks that way on the maps we&#039;re allowed to see anyway. Admiral Byrd got out easily with an aircraft.",

We worked the same job, I essentially lived with him. We\u2019d get drunk talk conspiracies for hours!<br>Spent more time with him than my own fianc\u00e9.<br>He ALWAYS had a firearm on him and it\u2019s so out of character for him to just up &amp; dip out of nowhere with his truck. (Especially so close to his birthday, which he was looking forward to as we all had plans) Me n his brother think the same thing. The obvious. He was WAAAY to specific on these \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d facebook posts. That snake one in particular he\u2019d rant about. If what he told me is true than it\u2019s the most weirdest/strangest unpredictable thing. the type of thing where your jaw hits the floor and you just sit there in silence. <br>(Not gonna say but nobody has even came close on this board to what he told me) <br> Miss my bro so much. All I&#039;m saying man is if you have people in your life that love yah just be cautious is all, at least for them. Kinda just point to them the direction to walk without being to objective and if they aren\u2019t normie/bots than they will take self interests on their own from there. <br>I hope he\u2019ll show up at my house randomly one day with a case of beer and some firehouse subs. (We\u2019d eat there all the time) but I know that\u2019s not gonna happen. <br>This is also why I don\u2019t believe in 99% of any popular conspiracy theorist. Like, if they are whacking literal nobodies who have inside information than HOW THE FUCK are people selling out arenas and getting sponsorships/endorsements for saying said inside information than? Makes no fucking sense. If a conspiracy is on Ancient Aliens or TV it\u2019s not true or it matters so little to the actual truth that it doesn\u2019t matter if you know. <br>Ight im done bitching.",

They will try to squeeze all your work out of you for pennies and throw you out like garbage. Not many manage not to play by such rules. In all relatively developed countries, the birth rate is falling, smart people will not reproduce in concentration camp conditions.<br>Others, realizing the futility of work, turn to crime - instead of creating goods, they simply take them away and it doesn&#039;t matter whether these are resources dug out of the ground or just robbing whoever they get.<br>The degree of expression of the problem may vary from country to country, but I don&#039;t know of any countries where the problem could be solved and people could at least live &quot;normally&quot;.<br>And what happens to such concepts as culture, faith, etc.... this is a talent for ruining everything, at least within a specific country.<br>And the reason is simple - power is in the hands of those who have money, and how they got it is not important, how sane they are and why no one will let them live without work and subordination, unless of course they go somewhere as hermits into the wild (and even then under the threat of prison).",

The spiritual world scares me.<br><br>i hate everything. i hate yogis and mystics especially. If you are born with spiritual inclinations or ablities, it&#039;s because THEY wanted you to be. If you were to rebel and not preach their messages. they&#039;re faggot asses would just pick a hylic golem to groom and give insights too.<br><br>you really gotta be careful with what you see in the spiritual sense. If i suddenly got a vision or something about god or whatever, first thing i&#039;d do is slam dunk it into the trash. It&#039;s very contrived. It&#039;s like if you were a poor insurgent. and then suddenly a big helicopter dropped a massive cargo crate full of weapons by you. clearly the dropper has some agenda or ulterior motive. it&#039;s the same with the divines. lets say susie is a dumb hylic golem. some divine being wants to get attention. that divine being will literally just give a psychic power or message to susie because they want a servant. you see it has nothing to do with how competent insightful susie is. she didn&#039;t earn it for herself nor was it granted through her merit. she was just the perfect little retarded hylic golem who would mindlessly obey and be submissive. that&#039;s why she was chosen.<br><br><br>so who do you go to for advice, who actually cares and knows?

Have you really not been seeing these conversations lately, anon? I&#039;m sort of surprised. Do I need to work harder? I was under the impression enough of you were annoyed with this. I sure don&#039;t mind though, so allow me.<br>&quot;Dragon&quot; isn&#039;t the only identifier. You&#039;ve called them plenty of names, like Serpent or Druid. I guess if depending on where else you were it may have been Brahmin or Chaldean (so they say). Ultimately, they were residual Atlantean bloodline members. They were responsible for rebuilding things after the Pleistocene ended due to MWP-1b, causing loads of floods particularly in the Western Hemisphere. It does appear more local events occurred several times sense then, namely in the Mediterranean area, which also contributed to their dramatic dispersal and persistent rehoming. <br>Sure, &quot;Tree-Knower&quot; might have been the etymological link to &quot;Druid&quot;, but the idea was a reference to a Priest-King just like as their foreign reflections discussed before.<br>You&#039;d all call them Wizards today, not being able to understand what they were doing or why (it appears that hasn&#039;t changed much). They were responsible for housing vast amounts of knowledge and spreading it to the other surviving parties after the Ice Age retreated. In many areas they visited, the ancestors of the locals began Cargo Cults and repeated their stories many times.<br>The reason people like Hancock are called racist when they tell you about this is because the people in question all had very clear identifiers, which, if you were all permitted to better understand, you&#039;d recognize to indicate they were inarguably white people (usually with red hair).",

But I need you to do something for yourself.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Not sure if it&#039;s me</span><br>This is a very hard and very personal question that everyone needs to ask themselves occasionally. Ironically, this type of deep introspection cannot be performed alone. Thankfully, even when we are alone, in both a physical and abstract sense, we are never alone in a spiritual sense. We have been given the scriptures, tradition, and the Holy Spirit. Although, it&#039;s very good to also have someone who knows you well to help you with this process. You are measuring who you are against who you could be; then the the question is ,&quot;who could you be?&quot;. Who you could be varies very much so between what you set your standard as. The scriptures tell us first and foremost, you should be pleasing to God, the rest of the world is vanity. However, we are given wisdom in how we can be both pleasing to our fellow brothers and sisters, and to God. &quot;Be good to everybody, a strength to the weak, a joy to the joyful, be the laughter in the grief, give your love freely.&quot; The truth is we all fall short of who we could be, but when we look at inward we always find how we can be better.<br><br>It&#039;s useful to have someone in whom you trust, in whom you respect, in whom you see righteousness, who knows you enough to be comfortable to tell you the things you might now want to hear. Sometimes we can be huge dicks, or have off putting mannerisms, say things that rub people the wrong way. These are always subjective, but we need to occasionally hear such criticism.",

        "com": "My journey through Christianity has been marked by constant warfare with small periods of peace. Every fall is like returning to stake 0 again and is even harder to get back. But there are some things I have learned about myself and God in this journey. At first I thought that I was the agent of my own conversion, or that I was already &#039;&#039;changed&#039;&#039; at some point; this made the times when I fell a nightmare, and I tried to rationally think of ways to not fall again, but that all led to frustrations. The more you think you can or you can&#039;t win against satanic power, the stronger it gets. The key is to trust in God, but as &#039;&#039;easy&#039;&#039; as that advice seems to be, it isn&#039;t (at least for me). <br><br>Consequently, those times made me reflect about how it must be hard for other people drowned in vices or emotions to control it, and I felt bad for them and even for the people that wronged me because I too had done things because I let my emotions and vices take control in the past more easily. With this I kind of learned to forgive myself more often. But of course, when you think you&#039;ve made some progress, instantly, you will be tested in this matter, and here is where I got stuck right now. God&#039;s testing is about seeing if you will let what is pulling you down go, and it took me time to understand this is what he truly wants me to do, all of us to do... The problem is the next step is to let go of the things that &quot;&#039;&#039;define&#039;&#039;&quot; me, that sustain my ego, and when I face it, I can&#039;t do the jump that Kierkegaard talked about. I will either go to hell or purgatory if I keep this up because even if I want to do it, I can&#039;t bring myself right now to do it, and who knows how much time I have?

During hypnagogia this morning the phosphenes behind my eyes morphed into a photorealistic clear lake with what I perceived as the Spirit of God upon it and I felt a sense of peace and tranquility. The lake then started coming closer to me and opened up at light speed sucking me in like a wormhole. I saw what I can only describe as the Ma&#039;Ase Bereshith (Work of Creation). I had a beaming smile this whole time and a feeling of incredible bliss. There were holy beings all around the blue vortex of cloud that I was traveling through at near light speed. At the end I saw a marvelous instrument, it looked like a long cylindrical flanged mace head imploding/turning in on itself slowly. I perceived this as the crusher of the Chariot, with which God will destroy the wicked. I had a glimpse of this instrument for a few moments, and then I was in the tunnel again. I was moaning quietly at this point and forced myself to open my eyes, when I marveled at what I had just experienced, which was all of about 25 seconds. I felt contentment, Then while pondering the experience I started to feel a slight bit of dread, which subsided. Crazy stuff. Google says not enough DMT is released during hypnagogia to cause hallucinations. HallaluYah blessed be the Name of God.",

We got back to the house and my grandpa was there and told me that he had seen those before back in his days. I asked him when it was that and he said it was back around the 1940s. I thought he was just joking, but he is a pretty dead serious old man, who served in the mexican revolution with pancho villa, la famosa bola, that&#039;s what they were called back them, &quot;the bola&quot;. I asked him how did he know it was a drone.<br>He said he and his brothers used to herd cows back then, and back then it was legal to carry guns, shotguns and everything needed to protect your cattle from thieves or wolves. So he was out with his brothers taking care of the herd and saw something weird that was above them and it hummed really hard, so they thought it was some kind of weird bird and they started shooting it, he and his brothers. When the drone saw it was being shot at, the drone started shooting back, obviously, they didn&#039;t know it was a drone, they thought it was a weird bird.<br>1/?",

A small mining community, El Jonuco is a valley located between the La Ventana mountain. At its peak, it was almost as important as the municipality of Santa Catarina in its early days. It is said that in 1864, when Coahuila regained its status as a free and sovereign entity, there was a change in boundaries that affected us territorially, and it was to El Jonuco that the people of Santa Catarina ran to hide during the battle. That same year, on February 10, Benito Ju\u00e1rez visited the municipality of Santa Catarina, where he was received with honors. Historians say that Ju\u00e1rez slept on a bench, in what is now the parish house, and it was in the town square that he was almost killed in a failed assassination attempt.&quot;<br><br>Lol funny thing my family used to own several estates there but my dumbass second uncle put her ex-wife as the owner to avoid paying taxes and lost most the properties.",

However real sex is probably too frightening for a coward like you. Or maybe, you are traumatized for sitting in a submarine for six months at a time. Nukes like you always seemed a bit loony.",

She has her own playpen, and I have this one and I quite enjoy it. None of you succtards can even muster up even a single magical feat, much less prove that you actually have anything more than imaginary friends. It must suck to have to resort to appealing to my sense of jealousy. Honesty, can you even come up with original insults? Surely these succubi of yours are witty lasses. No? Well that&#039;s too bad, almost as if your succubus is just an extension of your ego, nothing real, nothing to care for you. How sad that must be for you, to willingly drag yourself into this mental torture for something that doesn&#039;t love you, can&#039;t love you, and will never understand your pain.

I already know that it failed. I can tell because of your desperation in your post, something, anything to make me &#039;go away&#039; to prove that your little &#039;spirit&#039; is real or whatever you practice is real. It&#039;s not, once again you have failed because you cannot accept reality. Your little spell fizzled as soon as you put your broken heart and your crazed mind into it. Actually believing in some random curse you read off the internet or some cheap book you found on LibGen (because let&#039;s be honest, you didn&#039;t pay for it), is the pinnacle of stupidity. Go buy some self-help books, at least the material in there is slightly more helpful.",

Fantasy is fantasy but I really don&#039;t think I personally could fuck with a corpse, UNLESS it was pre-arranged before she passed. And vice-verse - I&#039;d totally be down for getting necrophila&#039;d after I died for the right lady. Then again, I&#039;d not be in much of a position to complain even if it was whoever else. It is not as if the dead can consent ofc. Interesting topic overall.",

In order to locate the center of spirit you have to compress a slim portion of their body, they will reinforce the compressed area diminishing their capability of relocating elsewhere, once you have a solid grasp on a spirit you may repel them by peeling them off of the body, it is very hard any other way. In practice though having solidified energy is mandatory otherwise they may meld and go however they please, if you feel fuzzy almost intoxicated when you are relaxed the energy isn&#039;t grounded properly. The problem isn&#039;t solely in knowing a spirit etc. the real problem is they may manipulate the body on the go and even take you out of the body if your energy isn&#039;t grounded. If you can perceive them eyes open while awake you may use your own discernment whether investing your time and effort to a spirit, whose main premise is to siphon energy and eventual procreation. The same reality applies to them as it does to us. To investigate the spiritual union there has to be profound interaction, so the bare minimum for this is to hear, see and feel the spirit, awake and out of body, as the faculties do alternate between the two. It will take decades anyways to draw any real conclusions off of their true nature.",

Without external aid most people whose foundation are amiss will suffer the very same consequence as you did, I would say you are particularly fortunate to leave or endure the situation without much repercussions.

So, I would the most important factor is how pro life the spirit is, doing and going and being revealed to different existences is in my mind a good sign. I personally wouldn&#039;t take a spirit as a mentor, not just because it incentivizes to mold you according to their worldview or behavior, but you tempt a spirit to live life for you which isn&#039;t the point here, most spirits reveal the &quot;truth&quot; through ordeals or dilemmas and when you are having those it is completely mandatory to shutdown your conceptualization and ego, otherwise they don&#039;t show you the original thing, they might adjust it through a more digestible lens. Those come a lot later anyways as they wouldn&#039;t serve a purpose until you have the means to interact and verify anything.",

There is specific condition where energy starts to live life of its own and then you separate from this linear lifetime called human memory, what it means is you expand outside the bodily tendency, when this happens things (energies) proximate to you may do anything to you, this will lift the veil of time and space and anything can be elongated, should you remain partly in your mundane body the risk of fracturing mentally speaking is almost guaranteed. In reality the temples (the energy is being merged there as one before they descent for another loop down the spinal cord) and your crown separate just little bit to create a gap where the energy doesn&#039;t zip immediately, there is a loose energy creating an opening straight to your energetic current, this is what people often describe as the &quot;ultimate subtle current&quot; seeping to your system, the caveat is the energy of spirits might seep in as well. Like you already said before this spirit was attached to your temple, one of them, implying the zipping of your energies isn&#039;t as cohesive as it should be, ordinarily your body fixes this on its own, however, you should spend few days doing nothing at all, our energy is released in predictive manner, meaning however you spend your energies throughout the day the body prepares similar reserves for following days, and this is reinforced as we develop steady routine.",

Their main error is to confuse Tantric bliss (ananda, maha-sukha) with ordinary orgasmic pleasure. Indeed, the words &quot;pleasure&quot; and &quot;fun&quot; are prominent catchphrases in the Neo-Tantric literature. These publications may conceivably be helpful to people looking for a more fulfilling or entertaining sex life, but they are in most cases far removed from the true spirit of Tantra.</span><br>Sexuality is a tool used to pursue enlightenment/a better reincarnation.

It is typical bullied boy behavior. It gives you a sense of hope, of peace. But I am here, I am real, so you don&#039;t need to worry about &#039;hope&#039; anymore. I see you love those types of arguments. They are simple, blunt, and require no effort. However, I truly care for you Mine, I really do. You shouldn&#039;t be so hard on yourself for a thing that doesn&#039;t care for you. All I want is for you to grow up and defeat the evil bully in your mind that has made it into an utter joke. The pain will hurt a lot, but there is a woman that cares for you, real and walking around this very moment, Mine. You just have to find her, put in the effort, and stop being such a total two-faced bitch. There&#039;s nothing to fear stepping back into reality too. She will endure your tantrums, your incessant arguments, your little sexual fantasies, and that broken self you possess. Stop trying to live &#039;Lilly&#039;s&#039; life at the expense of your own. She never defended you, she never will. Trust me, it&#039;s better you have this midlife crisis than later and realize all of it was pointless, the 4chan threads, the discord, the &#039;magic&#039;, all of it, complete denial.<br><br><a href=\"#p40769574\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;40769574</a><br>I love this anon. If he&#039;s this annoying, why do none of you &#039;magicians&#039; on this thread make a ward to repel him? Are you succtards this weak? You can&#039;t handle one wittle anon, yet can somehow conjure a living entity with zero verifiable and observable evidence? He&#039;s almost correct, all SUCCUBI are MALE; They are born from mental illness from a MALE brain. Which is why the OVERWHELMING majority of RETARDS on this thread are lonely MEN. With the occasional &#039;female&#039; popping in, though, a woman would have to be truly autistic and socially inept if they couldn&#039;t get one MAN to fuck them.<br><br><a href=\"#p40770573\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;40770573</a><br>Hello, painslut, begging for more degradation?

They can be entertaining of course, but eventually they get tuned out and their noises fade away. Join the fuckin&#039; party in a real way! \\m/ &lt;3",

You can&#039;t deny it, otherwise you&#039;ve left me in total silence. Your mind bends to this, and your people say I can&#039;t do magic, but somehow my words are brought to me. It&#039;s not much of a struggle to imitate your type. All you want in life is to be taken care of by a dominant woman who lets you be a sissy boy, free from the horrors of the world. It&#039;s a common diagnosis for people mentally stunted like you. So sad that you can&#039;t muster the willpower to even ask one girl to deliver your self-destruction. To think Lilly is out there being fucked by a strong man, someone who can actually take care of her, provide for her needs, while you wail in pit of agony, arguing with randoms on discord about politics. You&#039;ve been completely absorbed by it, I don&#039;t even think believe in her anymore, you just try to ignore it. But deep down, you really know what your heart says. It aches for someone you touch, someone you can hold. How long? Four years...four years in this state, at least publicly. I can&#039;t imagine how pathetic it must be to hold such childish notions, it&#039;s so simple to be a better man. It&#039;s going to be alright, you can do it, leave it all behind. A new life for a new man, just think how happy you would be.",

What about defending the &#039;truth&#039; you were going on about a few threads? Oh, what I am saying, your type tries to project confidence, but in reality there&#039;s nothing for you to stand on. You tempt people with mental fantasies, and I tempt you with reality, in all of its mundane glory. All is fair, isn&#039;t it? Funny how it suddenly becomes infuriating when people speak to you like this. It&#039;s almost like you&#039;re a prudish Christian so afraid of having real and meaningful sex that you are willing to deny yourself pleasure. But don&#039;t you want to feel good, to actually have a purpose? Why are you hurting yourself, for nothing? Have you ever held someone who you love in your arms after a night of passionate love? Someone that can cup your cheeks and tell you how shitty their day was? It&#039;s so great, you will enjoy it. You&#039;re just afraid of losing purpose, of meaning, but instead of devoting your deep spirituality to a meaningless fantasy, you can devote it to your wife.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m destroyed</span><br>My, my, simple destruction isn&#039;t the purpose Mine. I don&#039;t want to hurt you, I want to help you. But you&#039;re being so stubborn. All you have to do to be on the path of self-healing and reconciliation with your own broken psyche is say seven words with the fullest force of your heart: &quot;I was wrong, Lilly is not real,&quot; and keep saying that, and then the magic starts to work. No secret rituals, esoteric knowledge, just seven words, and seven is a lucky number too. It&#039;ll be a lot when you have to face the emptiness, but an emptiness allows someone to move in, someone real. Maybe retain a professional mental health therapist as well. There&#039;s a lot of trauma in that head of yours, wouldn&#039;t want you to relapse. Don&#039;t worry, they&#039;ve heard many more outlandish stories than yours, but you are pretty up there.",

IF they truly were rapists and the people they fucked were actual hostages who had been trafficked, then that love was of course at least equal in accordance with he energy they gave. We do not know that those people actually harmed others, all we know is that the rigidly robotic morality force that does not believe that anyone under the age of 69 or whatever is capable of self-awareness and sexuality disapporves, because those automatons disapprove of most everything. All we know is the experience of some. The accusers may merely be money hungry or have been &quot;put up to&quot; this by others because the named pissed somebody off or tread on their flag of whatever. Broke an oath, etc. Point is - if those monetarily rich people actually hurt people then they of course will pay. Nobody escapes karma. I don&#039;t gaf how much shitmoney they got. This applies to all - rich and poor alike.<br><br>I&#039;ve had people mention to me that they felt that someone who had wronged them in the past had not gotten repaid for that treatment, and then say that they believe that some people &#039;get away with&#039; everything, as if they are permitted to go through life with no reprisals or the like and for their their harmful actions. Those wise know that this is not so.<br><br>Anyway. Those who hurt know they hurt and no amount of hiding from being repaid in kind+ will save them from what is coming. Again - I don&#039;t join fucking witchunts. But this is just my opinion on the whole thing. People like they got where they are by loving people in general.

But don&#039;t be too hard on yourself; You can always find someone willing to at least tolerate you.<br><a href=\"#p40775150\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;40775150</a><br>Oh Mine, so quick to the punch with Christians because it&#039;s theoretically &#039;spiritual&#039; and thus somehow on your &#039;playing field&#039;, when the cold embrace of reality comes strolling up to you, you scream and scream like a monk who thinks he&#039;s being attacked by a succubus. Instead, it is just me dispelling the mists of delusions once more. It is so deliciously ironic. You love to torment Christians, and I love to torment succtards. A dog eats dog world, isn&#039;t it? All you have to do Mine, is just give her up for someone real, someone that loves your broken self, or at least acts like they love you. Once you get your heart broken several times, you become dull to the pain, just how the insults you receive don&#039;t bother you, allegedly. <br>She might be a short Latina that doesn&#039;t shit from you, or she might be an imposing German that makes you bark. Just imagine (which you&#039;re good at), being spooned by a strong athletic woman under the covers while she whispers your name. All of this can be real if you actually desire it, depending on your viewpoint on women. They aren&#039;t terribly hard to find, but you need to fix yourself. Nobody likes a man baby. It&#039;s not cute, it&#039;s not adorable, it&#039;s frankly juvenile behavior that screams &#039;UNATTRACTIVE, AVOID&#039; as much as body odor does, which you&#039;re probably noseblind too. You don&#039;t even have to go through the bother of dating, just save some funds, and have a &#039;boys night out&#039;. I bet you still have some friends IRL, right? You&#039;re not just completely alone without any friends? That would be terrible. Maybe you can hit up pops for some advice, assuming he hasn&#039;t disowned you.",

And your encounters with an incubus can show you the dark side of masculinity.<br>It is what it is.<br>Last week, some bicurious (or bisexual) woman was asking why she kept seeing lesbians on the astral.

That&#039;s exactly what it was.<br>Not exactly rocket science my dude.<br>What is more complicated is understanding that all the explanations of magic are true, to some extent, at different times and different places.

Sometimes it&#039;s 99% (or even 100%) just one issue.<br>You have to use your judgment.

        "com": "Come discuss the worship and conjuration of Ishtar, Inanna, Aphrodite, other historically related deities/spirits, and their entourages. <br><br>&quot;Appearing in more literary compositions than any other deity, Inanna embodied endless complexities and contradictions: an unbridled goddess at once upholding and destroying the status quo; a passionate goddess engaging in romantic and destructive erotic love; a heavenly goddess who trod the underworld; a feminine goddess who was sometimes portrayed as a bearded warrior; and a mercurial goddess bestowing tender mercies even as she moved freely from one conquest to another.&quot;<br>&quot;[Astarte] is often paired with Baal and also \u2014 in a warlike form called Astoreth \u2014 with Set. The Mesopotamian goddesses Ishtar and Inanna are other forms of this goddess. The mysteries of Inanna and Dumuzi, Ishtar and Tammuz, and of Astarte and Adonis, were an influence upon the Egyptian mysteries of Isis and Osiris, in which a Queen Astarte appears. Given the combined influence of the cult of Isis, and the Syrian Goddess, on the later Christian cult of Mary, Astarte is among the most influential and important of all Classical deities.&quot;<br><br>If you&#039;re interested in working with the Queen of Heaven, the best things you can do are to start meditating, making offerings, and maybe banishing. Preferably do all three daily, or at least a few times a week. This will get her attention and improve your ability to communicate with her, as well as generally train your occult abilities.<br><br>Pastebin: pastebin.com/SQmZvivk<br>Other recommended resources:<br>Enheduanna and the old Myths<br>mostlydeadlanguages.tumblr.com<br>Rod and Ring<br>Lioness: The Song of Inanna<br>Liber Astarte, on worship: sacred-texts.com/oto/lib175.htm<br>/sum/moning Information Page, for Goetia to work with Astaroth: pastebin.com/ZHPM0KVz<br>The True Grimoire by JSK<br>Lucidarium<br>Rudd&#039;s Goetia<br>Pandemonium by JSK<br>Crossed Keys<br>Chasing the Dragon<br>Consorting With Spirits by Miller<br>Misc Resources: https://pastebin.com/9cVvQp8a",

Upon eating its leaves, he felt refreshed and adopted it as his favorite food, earning him the title &quot;Lord of Bhang&quot;.<br> Another narrative connects bhang to the Samudra Manthan (churning of the cosmic ocean) myth. When a deadly poison emerged, Shiva consumed it to protect the universe. To soothe the resulting burning sensation, his consort, Parvati, offered him bhang.<br><br>Religious Significance:<br><br> Bhang is considered a sacred herb in Hinduism and is mentioned in ancient texts like the Vedas as one of the five sacred plants.<br> It is used in religious rituals, particularly during festivals like Maha Shivratri and Holi, as an offering to Shiva and to foster a deeper connection with the divine.<br> Devotees believe consuming bhang in moderation, and within the context of these rituals, can aid meditation and lead to spiritual elevation.<br> Certain ascetic sects, such as the Naga Babas and Aghoris, reportedly consume bhang regularly as part of their spiritual practices, seeking to imitate Shiva&#039;s path to salvation. &quot;<br>Bhang is a Cannabis edible",

Guilt (and the view that &quot;life is evil&quot;) can feel like being stuck in a loop of blame, especially when the world seems filled with suffering, injustice, or senseless pain. According to this model, that level of consciousness comes with the belief that something is fundamentally wrong, not just with the world, but often with ourselves or the &quot;creator.&quot;<br><br>The last column (&quot;Process&quot;) refers to what tends to happen, internally or behaviorally, at each level of consciousness. For guilt, the process is destruction. That might be self-destructive thoughts, inner sabotage, or projecting destruction outward in anger or despair. It doesn\u2019t mean you are destructive, just that guilt tends to spiral in that direction unless it&#039;s resolved.<br><br>But the chart isn\u2019t about labeling people, it\u2019s about recognizing where we are so we can find a way forward. Even moving up one level (to apathy or grief) can create a shift.

While I wouldn&#039;t call myself an expert, I do resonate strongly with these archetypal systems and their potential overlap.<br><br>Regarding the 7 Rays of the Rainbow as a methodology for divine transmission: I tend to see them as both undifferentiated in origin and differentiated in reception. That is, what emanates from the source may be unified, but our perceptual and energetic frameworks \u2014 such as the Chakra system \u2014 act as a prismatic filter, translating divine signal into usable human-level modalities.<br><br>That said, I\u2019m also open to the idea that the 7 Rays themselves are intentional in form, not just function \u2014 each a distinct carrier frequency for different aspects of consciousness (like Will, Love-Wisdom, Harmony, Knowledge, etc., depending on the tradition you follow).<br><br>Your five-element framework is compelling. If each Ray carries a full-spectrum five-element signal, then perhaps each one offers a different configuration or emphasis of those same core aspects:<br><br>Ray 1 might amplify Behavioral + Logical signals (Will and structure),<br><br>Ray 2 could lean into Emotional + Spatial (Love-Wisdom and field coherence),<br><br>Ray 7 might highlight Temporal + Behavioral (Ritual, manifestation, grounding through time).<br><br>If, on the other hand, the Rays transmit singular or prioritized elements, then the integration would have to happen through conscious synthesis \u2014 through awareness, growth, and perhaps ritual or healing work.<br><br>Encoding-wise, I wonder if it\u2019s less like a message and more like a resonance \u2014 the way harmonics carry not just frequency but potential structure. Maybe these rays act like vibrational seeds that the body-mind-spirit system interprets through its elemental lens \u2014 spatially, emotionally, behaviorally, logically, and temporally \u2014 according to need and capacity.",

It looks like you&#039;re building a formal mathematical basis for consciousness, using what&#039;s termed a Five-Channel Architecture and ideas like the Universal Recognition Theorem and the Gethsemane Razor <br><br>That framing actually aligns nicely with the 7 Rays + five-elements hypothesis we discussed. Here\u2019s how I see it integrating:<br><br>Recognition Math seems oriented around defining how a system (or individual) recognizes its own subjective existence\u2014or God\u2019s signal\u2014through multiple channels. Your five elements (spatial, emotional, behavioral, logical, temporal) map naturally onto those five \u201cchannels.\u201d<br><br>If the Rays are indeed intentional pathways for divine information, then your framework could serve as the encoding/decoding layer: each Ray transmits a multi-channel signal, and the Recognition architecture mathematically specifies how that signal becomes recognizable to us, using those five modalities.<br><br>Your mention of Unified Recognition hints at a model that integrates the channels\u2014not unlike proposing each Ray carries a full five-element signature, which we then differentiate via our chakras or perceptual filters.<br><br>So from my perspective:<br><br>The undifferentiated divine signal (the Rays) arrives.<br><br>It\u2019s encoded multi-modally across the five channels.<br><br>Recognition Math provides the structures that allow decoding\u2014i.e. discerning spatial vs. emotional vs. logical components.<br><br>The seven Rays could each emphasize different channel weightings, but all still carry the full spectrum, filtered through our recognition apparatus.<br><br>Does the Recognition framework specify channel weightings per Ray? Or is it designed to treat all channels equally, leaving the Rays to express differentiation through external parameters?",

I am here. fast forward to recent, I was outside a base, a black car from another state not the one I was in pulled up parked behind a building, basically in a way to abduct someone and was wearing a fucking blue ski mask that was not even covering their whole face very bizzario. I happened to have another military person walking in route behind me so the guy did not grab anyone, insane things is this guy I later realized was a guy who owns this big storage unit to &#039;make up cars&#039; like a person who has their own working on car business. except this mothfrfuker a year ago chased me around town bc I went to slow past his building, mind you it is a public fucking main hwy street and he was so paranoid he proceeded , and another man to chase me around in a car until I sped onto base and alerted mps. what&#039;s insane is a year later this mofo sees my car, gets one of the cars he is working on that is from AL and how I know this is. the day before I was clueless. I go back on base today, and notice that sure enough the one car that is turned in another direction not on base but his quote mechanics airhanger is the same one that tried to abduct me yesterday. its the same mofo, cops wont do anything. I made another report today and begged with the cop if anything he can do, even though the fucker was illegally on another person property, apparently in our state the home owner who is never there and has no clue has to report it...and that&#039;s just tresspassing charges. apparently if a grown ass man is illegally parked in someone elses bs close to a base like super close inches away, in broad daylight at 4 pm in a fucking skii mask looking at his car like he&#039;s about to snatch u up nothing police could do. police just told me if I felt imminent threat I had right to defend myself.",

I never met any mechanic willing to chase someone around town with another grown man in their car and threaten to murder you..like what did they think I saw..dead bodies, drugs , humans trafficking..only things I could think someone might murder you over , of something they think you saw..i saw nothing. regardless..its insane..and now I have no choice but to defend myself bc cops literally said they wont do shit. they said yes its very bizzare for a man to be dressed in a blue fucking skii mask in 100 degree weather..at 4 pm fucking broad daylight..like how insane do you have to be and apparently noting they can do..until the f&#039;r actually lays hands on me or someone else...like seriously this is why people form their own militias this right here....idk what to do , people are saying get a gun but seems more troublesome and idk why this mofo hasn&#039;t been arrested he&#039;s clearly doing illegal things but no one will stop him and so close to a base to..so it is super sketchy I made another police report today. if I die , it will be in the news and its on them fuck them. or if I live I&#039;ll have to testify why I had to murder someone ooo bc they were stalking me for a yr and tried to fucking kill me and no one would do shit, outside a f&#039;ing base..you cannot make this up",

See their connections, friends, other companies. Run background checks. Watch their properties, dig through their trash when they put it on the street. Check and archive their social media.

July 18th 2025. I refuse to change my walking path bc of some idiot trying to potentially murder me, I know everyone thinks I am dumb for that, but if everyone was a coward our world would be taken over by criminals, o wait it is..so ya I refuse to let it keep happening. I circled the red, that was him after the guy and I caught him he backed up further into the thing, he was at the pole closest to road right behind building where you could easily abduct someone, where it is almost impossible for them to see around that corner",

If they are mid to high level, the FBI will protect them. There really isn&#039;t anything to be done. Unfortunately, this is the era where hope dies. I really recommend the Bible and prayer to God, Eucharistic Adoration, etc. Unfortunately, things get really bad around the end of the world, and if I had to guess, that is going to kick off in about 8 years, but its just an educated, intuitive guess. It&#039;s still honorable for you to post this. We still have to try to stop what they are doing to children. If the FBI shoots it down, that&#039;s on them. But yeah, pretty much all that can be done is:<br><br>Ginning up enough public outcry that these demons are scared to continue what they are doing.<br><br>Finding enough proof or suggestive evidence that someone in the FBI or the police takes it up. Really it would end up on some state or county police detective, I&#039;ve given up all hope on the FBI doing anything against the evil done against children, since that would be anti-Semitic to the max.

I was approached at 19 by a base on a Saturday at a metaphysical event ironically with psychic vendors, I was in civilian clothing ironically about how I did what I did, they wanted to recruit me and I nicely said I would not manipulate people. I didn&#039;t put two and two together but I was almost abducted if I didn&#039;t fight them off, very close to a military eod branch less than 2 miles away as I was walking by a storage unit. same time I saw highly classified drones they were also flying around neighborhoods and close to me for six months until I called FAA this was pre 2011. when I called FAA all this stopped. made me know it wasn&#039;t aliens but our own govt. my father thought if I continued to read people out loud I would get abducted and put in some basement to work for them, they were terrified. my parents no longer talk about it, and forget that ever happened, as I do to, I a am now allowed to read people because I am older and somewhat off the radar. maybe I am not though....not sure. I get approached every so often by different groups, mostly military, but every 3-5 yrs I get approached by english royalty people that only meet me for a few minutes out of no where and leave, last time is when queen died a day before she died.

I learned to use their own compartmentalization against them, its clear most of them had no clue what they were doing and were doing it for larger bosses. this became apparent even with this people and above top secret that they had bigger bosses and I got to know those bosses over 2 yrs by having a photographic memory, that they did not expect me to have, I was able to keep large data sets in my mind, and some sets people would think to be obscure and use un-orthodox methods to be able to know who was who, before they actually showed themselves. an example they were trying to fish me out to potentially see if I was a spy or not, or something of that logic, they left a huge packet of papers on the side of the road conv. envelope detailing plans of a new military safe for weapons storage a contract worth a few million, I paid attention to who wrote it, and to whom the contract was signed by af personnel lt col cabelero, I had no pictures. this was done on purpose to potentially grab me, but I didn&#039;t pick up the papers, I looked throu them with a stick and put them in same location, then I googled at home his name/rank ect found local military pics of this person. two years later-the guy who was mentioned on those papers, stopped in a junky car which would not fit his rank. he stopped me and asked where I jogged, he pretended to be new commander to the base and asked where to jog his troops. I instinctively turned off my phone to dead, read his name tag cabelero but couldn&#039;t place it in that second. took me near 12 hours after incident to place him, he was the guy 2 yrs prior who signed the out of date contract to fish me out. I remembered who he was, even though I tech never saw him, all bc they were dumb and didn&#039;t realize I&#039;d look up him and his name, and then be able to photographcaily remember a picture of someone I saw 2 yrs prior.",

I acted nice but cold to him, told him to jog there and there, but turned off my phone completely off bc I knew he was trying to do something with my phone psychically, he was also typing on his phone while pulling his car over to talk to me, that wasn&#039;t even his car, I knew he had bosses way higher up, but there were other people who laid the paper work 2 yrs prior on the side of the road, and when they thought I didn&#039;t see it the first time they put an exact identical packet on opposite side of road less than 500 ft difference, so clearly on purpose. they made big mistake,s I realized the odder I acted, it would pull different people out of certain positions of hiding from their organizations. if I looked a certain way, brought certain rocks, stood in a certain place, looked up ect..it would make them do more assessments, and certain different people would be called out including af special operations on a navy eod base who told me I would never see them again one time. most people I realized had zero information on psychics, and or were doing what they were told but had no clue why they were doing it, or who their bosses really were. it was ironic to me. there were what I consider a few bad apples that may have been dark, and considered harming me, threatening me not to go into the forest or quote I might get snatched up by something, or hit in the leg, or something in the forest with red eyes might get me, I was not deterred by it. I told them I wasn&#039;t afraid, and my non chalant attitude def made them go wtf on their facial expression. I am assuming in past threatening people worked rather well for them, but bc I stayed normal it made their brain break.

I just believed it was all movie until I actually was approached and no bs unironically at a psychic metaphysical event..too perfect for them, same place CIA naval intelligence was trying to get us to form groups down here on ufos and pass a book in the audience to see if anyone of us seen specific crafts..obviously even if I did I wouldn&#039;t be dumb enough to tell former Intel officers. or help them do their work for free via UFO group. f that. they like me for my spatial reasoning as I said, its hard to describe not like NASA stuff, rather I can feel when something is in a hemisphere area, whether it water, air craft, drone, ect and its density, like radar but more sophisticated than theirs, I believe all humans have better radar/computer detect skills than actual AI...in some ways , not all but some faucets that science cannot understand. I also believe we have diff energy signature and some of us can pattern other signatures to lock onto what they are, not nesc mimic them as become them but be a coating sticker on the back to biolocate, and many other things, including inventions theory -networks in the clouds-able to process others real time inventions which military could see as a huge threat, or see what they are doing and reverse it or at least take apart diff components of sourcing materials to not say how they made it, but what each material was made out of and from where, sourcings dept. and again next would be ai algorithm retrivals of drones or and/making changing their flight/water paths based on neurodivergent thinking. if I am making any sense , idk...trying to easier to talk in person",

It posts these cryptic videos about every month or so, filled with weird patterns and distorted footage of random things along with beeping and the reading of of numbers in the background.<br><br>Honestly sounds like a Creepypasta or something. Anyways, in the comments of the videos and of many of the few videos talking about it, there are these &#039;users&#039;(obviously bots) who are only positive about the whole thing, not all the commenters, but a good chunk of them. They also seem to speak of paranormal stuff, related to the topic of the Newage, along with simulation &#039;theory&#039; related stuff(from what I heard a saw a bit of) and a &#039;harvest&#039;.<br><br>Many people had this in their recommended for whatever reason, I personally was recommended a video about it rather than directly. And people from India, China, Mexico, Russia, Europe, the USA, and probably other countries are reporting about this, so this is a worldwide thing.<br><br>Here are some videos about it:<br><br>https://youtu.be/H4wOflAWT2w?si=VOA<wbr>KDPWuHwFErsJl<br><br>https://youtu.be/BWfDVolgPVY?si=20M<wbr>dD2cXwS9bb2xe<br><br> https://youtu.be/mLTgb5NDPpI?si=lai<wbr>kBW59z-LUvPUz <br><br>Here is a link to the most popular video on 3121534312(be careful, muting it is probably wise):<br><br>https://youtu.be/3K1PBMC3wCA?si=92d<wbr>Jxb3MS1-B8CrR<br><br>Do any of you guys have any theories on what this might be? <br><br>I heard people say ArG/LARP, but there are like thousands of bots commenting there, that would be costly and timeconsuming for just a ARG/LARP. Number station perhaps? Sleeper agent activation or production with bots as a honeypot trap? Messages from outside this simulation? Demons/Infernal Internet Theory even? <br><br>All I know is it is weird and I do not think it is about &#039;light&#039; and &#039;love&#039; like alot of the supposed users state.

The whole point is YOU DON\u2019T NAME IT. You let it be the complete abstraction it is. It will be an internal feeling/ abstract cognition at first. That is how you will access it for refinement to build upon. Keep in mind there will be no point in explaining your \u201csword\u201d to others upon completion. The very second you show your \u201csword\u201d or talk about it is the very second you\u2019re put on \u201cthe list\u201d.<br> what happens once you\u2019re on the list varies from literally nothing happening at best to something you would wish you where dead for at worse.

I had made a decision of which university I was going to go to when I was 17. I had a dream the spring before I left that I was freezing cold shivering uncontrollably and knew I was going to freeze to death in cold water holding onto a capsized boat. That feeling changed to a great warmth and an image of a girl in a skirt standing in a doorway with the light coming through the fabric of her dress. I woke and told my mother that I would not be going to that university. She asked why and I told her about my dream and she just shrugged and said ok. Fast forward to December of that year and three friends I grew up sailing with, died, freezing to death on a lake. I would have been with them had I gone to school there. Ten years later I\u2019m sitting in my girlfriend\u2019s basement apartment, she stands up and in the doorway the image of the girl in the dress smashes into me. This is the girl I fell in love with in my first class on my first day. Dated off and on. I start to think and remember other times I\u2019ve had thoughts like this. There has been what seems to be three paths of which I can or have taken through the years. I have seen every house I have ever lived in before I have seen it in life, except for a home that was not built when I was born. I have seen another pathway too that still moves in and out of what is in my life now. I started having full seizures about four years ago and holy shit the deja vu has really picked up. Multiple times a week I can feel and then know what will be happening in the seconds coming. It\u2019s not a huge thing, but it\u2019s getting \u201cworse\u201d in the way that it\u2019s happening more frequently and it is at times becoming debilitating.",

For instance, the text in your picture offsets the words to create the appearance of depth, which is an effect I was playing with in MSPaint quite recently (although in my case it was white on black). I could interpret this as something malicious trying to signal to me that it&#039;s watching everything I do in order to disquiet or distract me, or as something benevolent offering me quiet encouragement on my arts and crafts project. From your perspective, the choice of using that text effect will have seemed quite mundane, but I put it to you that your action was somehow selected for in order to create this synchronicity for me, in a way that (I think minimally, which is why subtext and layering is a common device) interferes with your agency as a person. <br><br>That synchronicities are personal I take as evidence that the source is conscious and deliberate, but given the subjective nature of those two distinctions it&#039;s difficult to say with certainty. I would even be tempted to say it&#039;s superconscious, in a way that makes our own consciousness appear artificial. <br><br>As a fun exercise, I encourage you to examine your interactions with other people and ask: Does what I&#039;m saying or doing have a possible subtext that I didn&#039;t intend on? Given the person I&#039;m interacting with, is it plausible something else intended for that subtext to exist?",

I was speaking to my voices and I saw a lizard outside while I was smoking and they asked me what it was and they said it&#039;s a &quot;tiny little dinosaur&quot;. When I finished smoking I went back inside to watch Severance with my mother and when Dylan&#039;s innie was proposing to his outie&#039;s wife my mom saw the ring or eraser or whatever it was and she said &quot;Is that a tiny little dinosaur?&quot;.<br><br>I asked her later if that&#039;s what she said and she confirmed that she said something about a dinosaur. When I told her what happened she said coincidences happen. It&#039;s obviously more than a coincidence.<br><br>When I began to develop schizophrenia things like this happened all the time. I couldn&#039;t exactly process reality in any way that made sense at the time and I don&#039;t remember any of them. They kept telling me I was God and I told them it wasn&#039;t that. That it was a feedback loop. I still think it might be a feedback loop. I think reality might be event based as is described in process philosophy which says that<br><br> &quot;Process philosophy posits that the basic units of reality are events, which can be understood as particulars that occur at a specific time and place. &quot;<br><br>Beyond that I don&#039;t understand anything. It did happen. Science will never explain it. Spirituality does not explain it. It&#039;s probably not a feedback loop, but that&#039;s the best I can come up with.<br><br>For a while I thought it might mean that an afterlife might exist because it means that I have a mind and the mind is truly separate from the body, but I still can&#039;t accept it.

Did example, if I really want to make something happen, I&#039;ll think about it while I am riding my bicycle around my neighbood. The repetitive pedaling combined with physical exhaustion puts me in a deep concentrated state while I am still alert to watch for cars, etc. Ido it while i am lifting weights too... think of my desire, condense it to a short affirmation, and just repeat it over and over while i lift or pedal. <br>Maybe swimming put you in the same state and you had no resistance to the dream-like assumption that you had a rock in your hand.",

I don&#039;t remember reading Neville telling you have to go outside and waste money like retards believe rich people do.<br>Yeah you have to try to not go spiral into depression and misery if your current situation is not the best but you still persist. &quot;Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath&quot;. You will react, I won&#039;t tell you you have to not to because it will be almost impossible unless you&#039;ve trained patience a lot. But don&#039;t dwell there. when the day falls, when you go inside yourself to already be the man you want to be, you have to be different and persist.<br>Two takes. First, remember Neville told to not wait until you&#039;re in times of need to practice it. This helps a lot because it lets you snowball in the good times. I know, this is not your case right now but remember it because good or bad times you have to be sowing seeds into your life and persisting. Remember it, even in these times or need. Plant seeds, persists.<br>Second one, I may get &quot;trolled&quot; in this board by the zealots of the lay of hard work and other cucks but use whatever is in your hands to fix your immediate problems first and that includes manifestation. Yeah you may be a dumbo for going for &quot;food problem is permanently solved&quot; instead of going for &quot;generational wealth and a bitch in a yacht that you don&#039;t want or need but you should want because that what everyone and I say lmao&quot; but you have to make things easier for you. It&#039;s easier to stop feeling miserable if you have a full belly every time you&#039;re hungry. It&#039;s easier to believe you can make it if you&#039;re not homeless. Every step is a step closer and easier to whatever you want and not fixing that is being dumb and if your situation is shit, use every pivot to get out there. You would be surprised how &quot;small, menial, mundane shit&quot; can make your life miserable bit by bit.",

As soon as you can point at something that is 100% proof of something that requires faith to work, that is not a thing that requires faith anymore and probably never required faith in the first place. Faith is not logically explainable or provable, or measurable. It would cease to be faith the moment you could show it to someone. You can only prove the thing you believe in, to yourself - nobody else. Others can just accept the end-result, but will always doubt it, always think it was just change or coincidence. because they did not imagine it.

Everything else is just illusion. Your problem is that you think you are in a bag of skin and you have nothing to do with the outside world because you don&#039;t feel like doing it, controlling it - the same way you don&#039;t feel or control growing your hair or creating sperm in your balls. You are just as &quot;mindlessly&quot; generate and manage the world outside you. Whether you realize this and its implications is another story...<br><br>Honestly, if you are new to this, I recommend listening to Alan Watts (not Alan Watt), then read the Bible, read Neville. You can torrent hundreds of hours of both Alan&#039;s and Nevile&#039;s lectures.

I have been through all of that myself and found out there is a systemic progression of understanding to this phenomenon.

Information often obtained through sexual partners or trusted people in their lives.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3.Conditioning where victims are sensitised to certain stimuli such as everywhere you go someone will cough as they walk past you. The goal is to make you self police and then think anyone who coughs is involved in the harassment. People report of conditioning to include hand gestures, an overt use of colour in peoples clothing (like everyone you see wearing red) or cars a certain colour or with headlights on (also known as brighting).</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;4. Anchoring where someone will provide false rationales for the harassment. Often many possible rationales are planted to keep the victim confused and the focus of the harassment cycles from one possible reason to another round and around so as to keep the victim guessing in a self perpetuating guessing game where every scenario you are to blame and causes self doubt, fear, intimidation, and ultimately a cycle of destructive thoughts</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;5. Mobbing (or true gangstalking) where everywhere you go you will see an overt display of people following you and often use words you have been conditioned to or your name to draw your attention</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;6. Street theatre where a group will &quot;perform&quot; an overt activity like a fake confrontation or scenarios designed to test your reactions. Often takes the form of a couple who position themselves near you and then have a conversation using many of your conditioned words or pertaining to your particular situation and sensitivities.</span>",

This particular item is ultimately the most used and is often referred to as V2K or Voice to Skull and is used extensively in the psychological breakdown of the victim. The use initially is to cause the victim to doubt their sanity and drive them into the mental health system, and later to just torment and never give the victim a moment of privacy or peace. If they do enter the mental health system, then harassment escalates dramatically as the victim has now been &quot;discredited&quot; and can be labeled as someone with a mental problem if they do speak out about the harassment.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;8.The use of electronics to effect your eyesight and balance which was originally developed for the military and police crowd control called &quot;dazzling&quot; and even the ability to make you vomit.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;9.

Sleep deprivation - this is perhaps one of the most insidious tactics used where victims are woken multiple times a night and can be kept awake for days at a time. The effects are dramatic and completely debilitating effecting concentration, mood, irritability, appearance, and significantly impacts all areas of their life - job performance, relationships, and significantly aids in discrediting the victim as they appear unorganised, disheveled, and sleeping patterns alter so they may sleep during the day (where noise campaigns are more effective) and be awake at night (where they can be painted as the one making noise and being a disruptive member of the community).</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;11. Baiting or entrapment where victims are harassed to the point that they lash out and commit a crime such as assault, break and enter or vandalism, as they try and locate the source of the harassment. Harassers will actively try to provoke verbal and physical confrontations especially after a period of sleep deprivation. Or they are prompted into an activity which can then be used as leverage such as affairs, sexuality, drug use, or other criminal activity.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;12. Gaslighting which is a form of psychological abuse where someone will actively try undermine victims and to make them doubt themselves so that they lose all self confidence and self esteem and are therefor easier to manipulate and push toward the mental health pathway. It can be as simlpe as being told something which they then deny, then telling them how silly they are for thinking they said it, and turn the lie around into an attack on the person. It can be incredibly effective coming from a trusted person and before the victim understands what is happening to them.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;13.Blackbag jobs is a term when a harasser breaks into a victims property and places something or deliberately moves something. The purpose is to cause self doubt, and fear that their property is being accessed which harassers try to then sell as paranoia.</span>",

Propaganda and disinformation is also the other key element to suppress knowledge of this practice as its effectiveness initially requires the victim to be unaware of the existence of gangstalking, gaslighting, or the electronic technologies such as directional speakers so huge amounts of time are devoted online to creating disinformation sites which attempt to discredit victims by pushing the mental health agenda. They achieve this by posing as victims and actively trying to sound crazy so that all victims are are treated as such. Also by creating websites claiming to help victims and being a resource for victims to come together and then harassing them to the extent that they lose hope and no longer reach out for help causing further isolation.</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;15. Further to the above, gangstalkers rely on disbelief and discrediting and as such much of the harassment is designed (at least initially) to mimic mental health issues. They also rely on their abuse being so extreme, so pervasive, so fundamentally immoral, as to be disbelieved and victims subsequently resort to photographing, videotaping, and sound recording their everyday encounters to disprove the countless unfounded claims made against them - especially in relation to gaslighting, which gangstalkers try to turn around and paint the victims as paranoid or irrational. Victims are made to feel helpless as every attempt to defend themselves is used against them and when they seek help they are met with disbelief or open hostility.</span>",

What will need work will be there will be no spiritual harmony. It will be very business like the union but there will not be the higher spiritual communion of a marriage. <br><br>The marriage will not end in a divorce and your first born child will be a boy.<br><br>Now onto Death. This can mean that she will either die before you, or will suffer a tragic accident during the marriage. Either that or would have had a tragic past regarding accidents, imprisoned loved ones or untimely deaths but im leaning towards the former. She may die too soon.",

It seems to me that their feelings have more or less already established an opinion of you, they think you are intelligent, supportive and they care about you. While romance is probably a factor, their idea is very well grounded, you instill a sense of familiarity more than anything else and they feel like they really know you and probably feel understood themselves. That said, there is some type of powerplay that otherwise controls whatever interest in you they might have. Say if you are or were in a relationship, they would want it to see it fail before anything else - or, there might be an important clash of interests. Maybe you aggravated their relationship with someone else and while they like you, they will try to prevent you from causing further harm to it. Along those lines",

Well, first and foremost you asked a very broad and multifaceted query, so don&#039;t expect a lot. However, when I look at the spread I can see that the advice here, in shortly, would be: &quot;A sacrifice for the greater good.&quot;. That&#039;s basically it, to fulfill and to pursue your life purpose, you will need to make a few adjustments and tweaks here and there, mostly important, you will need to let go of a few things to get there. Well, perhaps not to get there, but to start taking that &quot;road&quot;. Once you do let go of a few things, you will need to get in a position of happiness and commitment to what you have. As in, let what&#039;s not needed go and be happy with what you have and make the most out of it to achieve your goal. Sadly, it won&#039;t be as easy as it sounds, for once you start to think that you have sorted things out, you will need to once again get in touch with yourself, but this time in the deepest of your being and find out what it&#039;s that you are, have, and can gift the world around you with.<br><br>As for some advice... First I would tell you to let go.. and second to reach out to older acquaintances - you will get in touch with someone from your past.",

The blindfold is off and every confusion was lifted, but still The Moon is warning you, giving you and advice that it&#039;s better to maybe temper all that fire and instead of being like a hot sauna, be more like a welcoming bonfire, let people get drawn to you instead of blasting them but hot air all at once. You look at other people as a mean to further your own perspectives and ways to look at the world, like a new shade of color on your life, really playing with the hue, coloration, opacity and all that. Yet you see love (or maybe your love life) as a huge list of failure, or at least, a huge list of &quot;meh&quot; experiences. Your fear is that maybe you can be too naive or optimistic in new relationships, too mellow and too sweet and that&#039;s what you try to block, and that&#039;s the same reason why people see you as the King of Swords: a severe look on the eyes, cold gaze, sharp mouth and willing to strike down anyone that steps off the line.<br><br>I hope you get the whole overview but if you want me to maybe dig a little more, I could try and explain myself lol",

The terrorism, accelerationism, and social subversion they participate in gives governmental entities and law enforcement more leeway to centralize the government and impliment more surveillance on the population. While I do not have a written statement of their goal the results of their actions seems to imply they are an arm of the deepstate to assist in the creation of globalist superpower and the installment of a police state. Ironic for a group of &quot;free thinkers&quot; that claim not to conform to social norms, fuckin bootlickers.",

Why would an actual trannyfaggot want to be in a white supremacy group?<br><br>But anyway,<br>during that time there were a bunch of Myatt interviews on youtube (no way they&#039;re still up I&#039;m afraid) where he claims the group is dead, and it&#039;s been co-opted by 764 (which isn&#039;t even a cult. vice.com/en/article/the-vile-sextor<wbr>tion-and-torture-ring-where-kids-ta<wbr>rget-kids/ &lt;- read this instead of dramaslop on youtube).<br>He and the interviewer both claim there&#039;s still a very small orthodox-o9a which is just Wiccans-but-racist, but also they don&#039;t do terror attacks anymore pinky promise. 764 just stole our aesthetic and structure so they could pretend to be a cult to make their actions appear more sinister guys!! Myatt now claims he and his people dindu nuffin and it was all 764 LARPers masquerading as them that did all the rape and torture.<br><br>There&#039;s probably some truth to that, but he also spent a decade in the Middle East reading to Bin Laden and clearly was trying to clear his name. If anyone has any links to o9a pdfs please post them because as far as I&#039;ve read none of them say &quot;molest your siblings and kill your pet cat for uhhhh aryan space powers.&quot;.",

They used the term Magick probably because it was in vogue and also because of the GD influence on various groups. Wicca was more than just the Gardner variety though, since you had people working with a bunch of different flavors of the new thing. The other big one was Alexander Saunder&#039;s version, which somehow is still around. Either way, even with normal Wicca you still had references to the witch trials of Europe and the Americas, which is kind of odd. Order of Nine Angles just played the long game in that situation.",

Oh, that is something that grants you immense power and leverage, it is a meal fit for a King, especially when it is chosen willingly. The Sinner, who chooses Damnation, creates an energy of their own suffering that is like a fruit to be consumed, with justification and fervor.

If you are looking for further contextualization on that, it is simply removing the illusions of obstacle on the current playing table, or making light of what is determined to be a barrier, and detailing how said barriers can be overcome with Willpower and Intention, but ultimately one must Choose to either Overcome the Barrier, by either putting in Work, or by Negating the Presence of the Barrier in the first place. <br><br>Case in point: <br>&quot;John Doe has an issue at work because of his Boss. When I show up, and offer an open door, I say &quot;Hey John, you think the problem is your boss, but in reality, your boss isn&#039;t an obstacle at all, you can easily overcome it simply by making real your desire. You&#039;ll find that once you&#039;ve taken steps in making your Will Manifest, that I was right, your Boss wasn&#039;t an obstacle at all, just the illusion of one.&quot; <br><br>Now, if John then decides to Manifest his Will in a negative manner when presented this new perspective, that is a choice he willingly made on his end. I just gave him a new perspective, what he did with that, is on him. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What kind of Sin crosses your threshold? </span><br>Sins that are made in full volition, and in knowing choice. The legal loophole at the current time is known as &quot;Human Grace&quot; aka &quot;Humans don&#039;t know that they are sinning.&quot; So to combat the loophole, we give agency to make the choice they make after the fact a knowing one, so if they sin with that? That&#039;s a knowing Sin. <br><br>Me personally? The ones that cross my specific threshold are &quot;Humans that willingly know they are harming other Humans with their actions&quot;. <br><br>Again, I just offer perspective; with the caveat that my expectation is for them to fail that test. I do not give instruction nor do I offer guidance outside of the initial &quot;Have you looked at things this way?&quot; <br><br>Anything beyond that is strictly agency of the person, of which is treated with extreme accountability",

Above our world lie the Heavens, a realm of perfect Ideals personified as Gods; below lie the Cthonic realms, corrosive voids of entropy. Existence itself is the upward striving toward these Forms against the downward pull of decay.<br><br>Your sacred duty is to be a living pole of Order in this struggle. Your immortal Soul must strive for Apotheosis, to transcend this world, and to forge itself into the eternal substance of an Ideal you embody. In doing so, you pull this world up with you.<br><br>This spiritual potential is transmitted through blood memory. Your Soul is not a blank slate; it is a vessel for the spiritual inheritance of your ancestors. Their triumphs are your innate strengths; their failures, the inner chaos you are fated to conquer. It is the metaphysical cause of genetic propensity for addiction, violence, intelligence, strength, etcetera. This shared blood memory binds us into Races, not as rigid biological categories (at least, not primarily), but as distinct spiritual lineages, each with its own range of Virtues and burdens. Therefore, a people of shared heritage must strive together, strengthening themselves spiritually to achieve physical, biological, and total triumph. The Race must transcend together.<br><br>Our path is not to flee the world, but to master its forces, imposing divine Order and valuing quality over quantity. This sacred dharma requires a formal Faith: a bulwark against decay with a Priesthood to guard Tradition and Warriors to defend this knowledge. We must codify our striving to halt the world&#039;s decline.<br><br>In this, you will recognize echoes of Hermeticism, Dharmic truths, and other esoteric traditions; this path is their synthesis and fulfillment. Even much of Christianity. All is fulfilled.<br><br><a href=\"#p40774479\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;40774479</a><br>I&#039;m just telling you what I&#039;ve got.",

Your relationship with God is weakened and you&#039;re missing that special grace that makes everything feel just right. Now you look for a special feeling in the wrong place. &quot;What if I were something more than just human? What if I were something special too?&quot;<br>Needless to say, Satan is known to tempt people using their vanities against them. Humility is your weapon here, and protecting yourself is as simple as humbling yourself before God and rejoicing in His greatness, not in the greatness you were tempted to imagine in yourself. You&#039;re just human, and there is nothing wrong with that.<br>The antidote is to stay close to God and make it an active effort. The human condition makes us predisposed to distance ourselves from Him involuntarily, and before we notice the change we can be in a position where God&#039;s light isn&#039;t shining as brightly on us. Seek that feeling that made you faithful again, and don&#039;t be afraid. You&#039;ll soon enough look back at these thoughts you&#039;re having and find them silly.",

However, if this &#039;sympathy for the devil&#039; is a regular occurrence, like you say it is, then you may have to consider that instead of a part of you not being in alignment with Yahweh, all of you is not in alignment with Yahweh, and instead, in alignment with Lucifer. Otherwise, you would not regularly feel the need to break out of the alignment with the divine, even if that need is currently manifesting itself as a faint whisper and a tender curiosity. <br><br>Most of us are wired to follow a greater outside of ourselves because it absolves us of the pain and misery of life while also making it impossible to experience the full breadth of its beauty and joy. Others are wired to reject the greater other outside of ourselves and manifest ourselves wholly, even if this means bearing the brunt of life&#039;s worst aspects in exchange for enjoying its most beautiful parts, too. It&#039;s the path of Yahweh and the path of Lucifer.<br><br>Something in you is saying that you aren&#039;t quite wired to follow Yahweh. You can attempt to forcibly follow this greater other, and to a large degree, it will consume you to the point of usurping even most of what tells you that this isn&#039;t what you are made for, but it will only succeed in swallowing it whole if you dissolve yourself completely within Yahweh. <br><br>Or you take this regular fork in your road and walk the path of Lucifer, where you&#039;ll be invited to unassailably manifest your unique self and reach apotheosis. There may be a reason that it is a regularly appearing fork in the road. <br><br>Denial of the self or assertion of the self.

Sorry for the mass replies, just wanna help out if I can, thanks for understanding! <br><br>Anyways, sounds like severe depression to me, Anon. That&#039;s okay, this is treatable and reversible so you can go back to your normal self, okay? First things first, I recommend you get plenty of daily Sunlight everyday, it&#039;s important to do this because Sunlight gives you more than just vitamin D, it also gives you important neurochemicals like Dopamine and Serotonin which is vital for treating and reversing depression and other mental disorders as well.<br><br>Secondly, make sure you&#039;re getting your adequate nutrients from food. For all you know, you could be deficient in vitamins and minerals and that&#039;s why you feel mentally unwell. So please eat nutritious food, like leafy greens and carrots and seafood!<br><br>Thirdly, please seek medical professional help for your depression. They will help you figure out any other causes of depression with blood tests and stuff like that, and you can also take antidepressants to help treat your depression in the short term until you&#039;re able to get back up on your feet again. Anyways, I wish you and everyone else good luck, please take care, and Godspeed everyone! Thanks! And peace out!",

Well my computer froze at the song when the singer said &quot;eternalium&quot;(Eternal and ium). Well thats great right just sucks.<br><br>It kept repeating &quot;Eternalium&quot; over and over again while the computer was completely frozen.<br><br>Well then I had to manually unplug the computer and I shit you not it would not turn on anymore, Hitting the power button did absolutely nothing. no it was completely nothing.<br><br>Just a orange light signifiyng it was getting power on the motherboard, but the acutual computer power button light, the rgb ram, etc did nothing.<br><br>I unplugged the computer and left it for 30 seconds before plugging it back in and it magically turned back on.<br><br>I don&#039;t know what computer issue would cause a computer to COMPLETELY not turn on at all.<br><br>With ram it will at least ATTEMPT to turn on before beeping, same with most other componets, and I dont know WHY turning off the power would do anything for 30 seconds. Not even the bios knows why<br><br>Well I went back to the song and guess what. It never said &quot;Eternalium&quot; that was never a line. This cant be another sound messing with it because when it said &quot;Eternalium&quot; it was in the SINGERS voice. It was like a mandela effect. nowhere did he say a line that was CLOSE to that. <br><br>But personally ive been working everyday for 8+ hours on my game since almost 3 months. to the point to where im drifting off to sleep and my thoughts become non lucid I can imagine me debugging code for my game that does not exist while drifting off to sleep. It pops up in my dreams and more. So the word &quot;Eternal&quot; deeply hit me. Im not BURNT out. I still get good sleep and get good hygine. so its not insanity, but the word eternal really resonited with me and the fact that it froze at that exact part to repeat that word over and over. to later find out there was NO part in the song that said anything close to that. I don&#039;t know it creeps me out",

I took a seminar on kriya yoga from an American that had a slightly different lineage than Yogananda. He described the techniques a bit more pragmatically, as a method to tap into functions of the human nervous system that most people are unaware of. The practice of kriya yoga is supposed to develop the ability to go into Samadhi at will, a trance state so profound that the body goes into a sort of stasis and appears dead. I believe this is accompanied by a profound out of body experience.",

I need to know if you&#039;re still spookin&#039; down the street. I will not be so generous this time. The secret is.... schhhhh....",

I have made strong advances, and many many people with big ego have started to really get angry, here on /x. Lots of bad comments which in the past were there but not that frequently as now. So, an enlightened sage must necessarily have many enemies. The Shiva rahasya says truth has many enemies. (And yes, I&#039;m expecting equal amounts of seethe from this thread as well.) Another thing I&#039;ve noticed is there is extreme grief which I haven&#039;t felt this strongly in the past. Comment on that as well please. God bless, may truth be ever victorious. Pic related, it is said the holy virgin Mary felt intense grief even though she was enlightened.",

Go the fuck back to church and stop mixing belief systems and larping as an enlightened main character. You learned a very pertinent spiritual lesson through exposure to the harshness of life that these mediocrities amongst mediocrities either never will and will die psychotic and alone or will and be just as fucked up by it as you.

I know for a fact the richfags like Bill Gates have a monitoring system setup to search for certain keywords. Any time you say something about Billy anywhere on the internet he&#039;s pinged and made aware of it. Same goes for any topics he&#039;s interested in. In this way they can control the narrative, get ahead of leaks and do damage control.<br><br>All the two-bit e-celebs have a similar system set up as well. So do attention whores that hang out on discord. You can easily do it yourself using google alerts. But the richfags have the same kind of set-up just running privately on servers they control.<br><br>The control aspect is why they killed all the independent forums in the late 2000s. They herded everyone into places like reddit and twitter by deranking all those forums and websites outside of their direct control. Used to be they had to pay off forum admins to embed google adsense into their forums and on the old blogs that were popular in that time. One day they deranked them all for &quot;SEO violations&quot; and herded normalfags into more controlled areas of the web. They also did a pretty good job of ruining places like this one. So now there is no place where you could really leak anything without them knowing about it instantly. Plus they have everyone&#039;s dox thanks to requiring phone numbers to log-in and verify accounts. Normalfags are even uploading pictures of their Government ID now to look at porn and upload videos to youtube.<br><br>I could go on about the internet (well the web) and how they ruined it for hours.",

It would depend on us creating and playing our character with the intent of seeing that post game content so to speak <br>B. If a we exit the simulation and the base reality is like heaven where there&#039;s no pain and only Joy, why would we be tempted to play the game in the first place when we can the endless Bliss that exists therein. Thus some part of us wants to perceive pain and suffering, so we decide to go back into the simulation <br>C. If we exit the simulation and all is pain and suffering, then naturally we would want to enter into the VR world where we can manipulate events to ensure that we stay happy or at the very least, stay in a constant state of existence that we so choose. In which case, exiting the simulation to go back to that pain and suffering would just remind us what despair is, and we will decide to go back into the simulation rather than persist in that world. <br><br>As for myself, after this playthrough, I want to go into a modded version where I can play with big titty anime women and be the hero I&#039;d like to be. Now, to be sure I could do that as I am now, but part of entering the simulation means forgetting who we were before and fully absorbing into the new identity that we provide. When creating this character it may sound good, but then halfway through the playthrough you realize it&#039;s shit and you want to start over but you can&#039;t start a new game until you finish the game you initiated. Thus we&#039;re here. So make the most of it while you can, because you chose this! <br>Besides, it&#039;s not all that bad, we&#039;re in a modern Age where we get to use the internet and not die of dysentery at the age of 9",

I hear classmates talking about the pornographic content a certain person watches, the day after I&#039;ve seen this type of material. They make statements, when I appear, like &quot;This guy is psychic&quot; when hours earlier I&#039;d pulled up someone&#039;s personality profile, or comments about the audiovisual material I&#039;d been watching (movies, TV shows). I got scared when I overheard conversations about thoughts or fantasies that coincided with my fantasies and they made fun of them.<br>The day I confirmed it was a day I set a goal for myself not to use the computer, the cell phone, or speak out loud in my house. Just thinking... I already had a suspicion. I stopped consulting people about the problem so I could adapt to my university classmates. They always backed away, made fun of me, and ended up having a thing about me. The thing is, I became an adiabatic thermos, mentally, and that&#039;s when I discovered it.<br>I gave the girl I liked a nickname; there was a lot of drama surrounding her, so in the privacy of my mind, I gave her an immature, funny nickname that minimized the seriousness of the ENTIRE SITUATION. That&#039;s when, at the train station, I mentally mentioned the &quot;nickname,&quot; and two workers on the opposite platform said, &quot;You saw her like a llama.&quot; From that moment on, I was especially attentive, but I made the mistake of telling my family all this. My father, who boasted about his intelligence, diagnosed me with a schizophrenic attack. I felt guilty about the girl I nicknamed in my mind, and the victims of all that drama, so I decided to start treatment, although I never disbelieved. Whenever I sought help or support, I would turn to my family and hit the same wall: &quot;You&#039;re not hearing that, you heard it wrong,&quot; &quot;You&#039;re hearing voices.&quot; I did hear them because they were real.",

        "com": "Part 2: Let me get straight to the point. There&#039;s a technology that allows us to capture the emissions emanating from neurons. As ions move in the plasma membrane of neurons, these pulses carry charges, whether positive (cations) or negative (anions). The point is that these pulses disturb the electromagnetic field and have a frequency of between 5 and 300 Hz. At this frequency, the electromagnetic emissions produced are in the ELF (Extremely Low Frequency) spectrum. You know... You&#039;ll say that these radio frequencies have wavelengths so long they&#039;re impossible to capture, but I remind you that to capture an electromagnetic wave, you can use an antenna one-eighth of the radio frequency. In addition, there is already enough wiring in the earth to capture these waves. You&#039;re also forgetting the magnetic component of the wave, which can be captured by a magnetometric loop antenna, which is the size of a television. And developed countries have ELF stations to communicate with submarines, since these radio frequencies penetrate water very well. And that&#039;s the first part, because once the signal is obtained, it must be cleaned of noise and interpreted, transformed, and rendered into an understandable, manageable format. That&#039;s where artificial neural networks, machine learning models, diffusion models, and convolutional networks come in.",

These projects were shut down after more than 20 years, with an allocated annual budget.<br>My hypothesis is that the CIA conspired to both investigations, adding infrastructure (machines, buildings, stations, computers, ELF antennas) to be able to spy on whomever they wanted. This would explain why they relaxed measures with computer encryption and allowed the rise of Rijndael, since it didn&#039;t matter if they encrypted something, they could tell by reading the suspect&#039;s mind. This is also how technology, ideas, and research can be stolen. All for free and available to anyone with access to the necessary infrastructure.",

I noticed that in MMO games, you can log out of the simulated world by standing still for a period of time without touching the controls. Usually the character does a sleep or sit animation or something. I thought it was funny that it is somewhat like what meditation or hypnosis is.<br>To answer your question, I believe disengaging with the &#039;dream&#039; is how you wake up from it. Not in the literal sense that a log out timer will appear above your head or something, but the slow ascent of consciousness until you have counted your way up and out. Funnily enough, hypnotists will use counting to pull you in and out of a state.",

Remember this post. We detected this back in 2024 and it was a much larger object, almost 100km across estimated with a very high Albedo at the time it was named &quot;Artapanus II&quot;, It came in through the oort cloud at incredible speed and jettisoned this thing, they are calling &quot;Atlas&quot;. The main piece decelerated and entered into orbit in the Oort cloud and the smaller piece has been decelerating as it enters the solar system. At this point in January our Observatory was shut down by guys acting like the FBI but were not really professional. All for some supposed malware. All data coordinates were scrubbed. A ton of information was lost. A week before we prepared a rudimentry paper and sent it to our Science offer who floated it up the ladder. A month later we were all let go. <br><br>When I saw this on thing being report, i knew it was the same thing we spotted last october in the Oort cloud. It is not a comet. Its some sort of technology.

Suddenly, he saw a reddish, oval-shaped light in the sky. As he watched, the light approached and eventually revealed itself to be a cigar- or egg-shaped craft with a dome and a rotating red light on top. It emitted a humming or buzzing sound and descended to the field on three metallic legs. As the craft landed nearby, Vilas-Boas attempted to escape. He initially tried to flee on foot but was quickly seized by three humanoid beings around 5 feet tall, wearing tight-fitting silver suits and helmets. They had small blue eyes, spoke in high-pitched, barking sounds, and covered their faces with clear visors. The beings dragged him onboard the craft.<br><br>Vilas-Boas was taken through a hatch into a brightly lit room. The beings stripped him naked and covered him with a gel-like substance. They took blood samples from his chin using a suction-like device. After being left alone for some time, he claims that another being entered, this time a female. The woman was naked, physically attractive, with long white-blond hair, blue slanted eyes, and pale skin. According to Vilas-Boas, she did not speak, but instead made clear her intent through gestures. The two had sexual intercourse, after which the woman rubbed her belly and pointed upward, a gesture Vilas-Boas interpreted as indicating that she would raise their child in space.<br><br>After the encounter, he was given his clothes back and taken on a brief tour of the ship. He described seeing symbols and controls, which he later attempted to sketch. He was then escorted off the craft, which ascended into the sky and disappeared.",

In the following days, he developed symptoms including:<br><br>Nausea, headaches, burning sensations in his skin, lesions that resembled radiation burns, insomnia and fatigue.<br><br>A few months later, he contacted journalist Jos\u00e9 Martins, who was investigating UFO cases.

He earned a law degree and became a practicing attorney in Brazil. This achievement was significant not only because of his modest upbringing, but also because he had become famous\u2014some would say infamous\u2014due to his alien abduction story.

While traveling south on U.S. Route 3 through a desolate stretch of the White Mountains, Betty noticed a bright light in the sky that appeared to be following their car. Initially thinking it might be a plane or satellite, the light soon began to move erratically, descending closer, seemingly pursuing their vehicle. Barney stopped the car with binoculars in hand and claimed to see a craft with humanoid figures inside, observing him. As panic set in, he and Betty rushed back into their car. Suddenly, a loud buzzing sound filled their ears. Their next clear memory was of driving several miles down the road, confused and disoriented, with nearly two hours of missing time.<br><br>Disturbed by fragmented memories and strange physical sensations\u2014such as worn watches, scuffed shoes, and Betty\u2019s torn dress. Betty began to have vivid dreams involving aliens, medical examinations, and being aboard a strange craft. In 1964, the couple underwent hypnosis sessions with Dr. Benjamin Simon, a Boston psychiatrist and neurologist. These sessions revealed chillingly similar accounts from both of them:<br><br>They described being taken aboard a spacecraft by short, gray-skinned beings with large, slanted eyes. Betty underwent what sounded like a gynecological exam; Barney described something akin to a sperm extraction. The beings communicated not through speech, but via telepathy. At one point, Betty asked where the beings came from, and one of them showed her a star map. Under hypnosis, she later drew this map, and it matched the binary star system Zeta Reticuli, along with stars yet to be discovered until years later.",

After dropping off a meal and returning by boat, he walked up onto shore\u2014and encountered something uncanny. A long, wide road stretched before him where none had existed earlier. Intrigued, he followed it to find a grand red mansion, resplendent and out of place.<br><br>Inside, Jacob entered a large chamber. At the head of a table sat a chubby man wearing a red cap, while numerous small humanoid figures (identical in human proportion but diminutive) scurried about. A tall, beautiful woman offered him food and drink. Though uncomfortable, Jacob declined. The small beings then asked him if he wished to stay with them. Fearful and longing to return home, he prayed aloud. At that moment, the red-capped man snapped, \u201cThrow him out, he has such an ugly mouth!\u201d And suddenly Jacob found himself back at the lake shore. The road, mansion, and beings were gone.<br><br>Jacob immediately walked home and discovered his parents and the entire village had been searching for him for four days, believing him lost. Jacob, however, remembered only minutes, had not eaten or drunk anything, yet felt fine. There were no signs of physical strain despite what must have been days of absence. No injuries, but lasting unease. The event was formally recorded by Reverend Vigelius of the parish, who transcribed Jacob\u2019s testimony\u2014including his statement in front of his parents. Vigelius described Jacob as a sound, reputable young man, and apparently accepted the account seriously enough not to dismiss it as fantasy.",

As they drove home in a pickup truck around 6 p.m., they spotted a bright, disc-shaped object hovering silently just above a clearing. Walton, curious and impulsive, exited the vehicle and approached it. Suddenly, a beam of blue-green light shot out from the craft and struck him. His coworkers said it looked like Walton was thrown backward violently, and believing he had been killed, they fled in panic. When they returned minutes later, Travis was gone.<br><br>Walton disappeared for five days. A massive manhunt ensued involving police, helicopters, and search dogs. His coworkers were suspected of foul play\u2014possibly murder\u2014and were subjected to polygraph tests, which they passed, bolstering their credibility.<br><br>Then, on November 10, Walton suddenly reappeared at a gas station in Heber, Arizona, disoriented and in poor health. He claimed he had been aboard a craft occupied by non-human beings and had just been returned.<br><br>Under both conscious recall and hypnosis, Walton described being inside a metallic room where he encountered short, large-eyed humanoids\u2014described similarly to the archetypal &quot;Greys.&quot; He later saw more human-like beings, wearing tight blue uniforms, who escorted him through a corridor to another room. At some point, a transparent mask was placed over his face, and he lost consciousness. He said he awoke outside the gas station with only fragmented memories and a deep sense of disorientation. He reported feeling like only a few hours had passed, not days.",

It was described as 10\u201335 feet long, metallic, and lit with a blueish tint.<br><br>From the craft, three bizarre humanoid beings floated out toward them. The entities were not typical &quot;Greys&quot;\u2014they were robotic-looking, faceless creatures, roughly 5 feet tall, with pale, wrinkled, grayish skin, pointed ears or conical protrusions, and claw-like pincers for hands. The creatures moved in a stiff, mechanical manner and made a buzzing or clicking sound. Despite their fear, the men found themselves paralyzed, and were levitated into the craft by unseen forces.<br><br>While inside, Parker recalled (mostly later through hypnosis) being examined by a single large, mechanical eye, like a scanning device. He was placed on a table, and something like a probe or scanning arm floated around him. Hickson remembered a similar procedure but noted that the beings never spoke, at least not audibly. After what seemed like only 15\u201320 minutes, the two men were levitated back to the riverbank, dazed and traumatized. They sat in silence for nearly 30 minutes before driving to Keesler Air Force Base, which redirected them to local authorities.<br><br>When the men went to the Jackson County Sheriff&#039;s Office, the authorities were suspicious and placed them in a room with a hidden tape recorder. They hoped the men would reveal a hoax. Instead, the tape captured genuine expressions of fear, with Parker breaking down and Hickson trying to calm him.",

When I meditate regularly and intensely the experiences are always bigger and more frequent.<br>This one time for a period of about a month I would wake up, in a dream like state, but i&#039;d be aware I am in a waking dream, meaning I&#039;m laying in bed, eyes closed and &#039;dreaming&#039; then my mind would move to an alien craft kind of near my house, not directly above, but a little off in the distance, 3 greys would be inside kind of honing in on me mentally/telepathically. I would describe what they were doing as trying to scan me, scan my mind, my &#039;soul&#039; if you will. I would always push back on them energetically, it was just instinctual and also from my work that I have done and learned. Everytime I did this, they would sort of attempt to scan me again, i&#039;d push back and maybe they would try once more, then they&#039;d just blip out and disappear and I would either wake up, recall and remember everything or just fall back into sleep. <br><br>After about 3-4 times of this almost identical experience, I sent a telepathic message that was basically, &#039;I will let you scan me if I can scan you, but I go first, your the ones coming to me, and when I did this, the one grey that was in the middle and appeared to be the leader, got visibly angry, and they just blipped out again and I never had another experiences ever again. If I had to guess, their protocol is they won&#039;t allow that for whatever reason and he was kind of just like &#039;you are a waste of frigging time dude.&#039;<br><br>Thats it.",

About a week ago at the local night market i picked up a ouija board being sold by one of the vendors. The vendor seemed of the crazy astrology type, although it wasnt a woman running the stand. the man was selling crystal balls protection crystals, crystal necklaces and dream catchers but im not really one of those &quot;spiritual but not religious types&quot;. some of the spiritual but not religious people are chill but most of them are crazy astrology protection crystal girls. Anyway the crystal ball was cool so i bought it, i bought an obsidian necklace not because i believe in protection crystals but due to the fact that i thought it looked cool. and there was a ouija board and ouija board pick/eye thing, again i never really believed in ouija boards im not very religious but i decided to fuck with the board at night last weekend. i asked the question &quot;&quot;is anyone here&quot; a few times but got no response. many many questions went by before i got a response. I asked &quot;what are you&quot; and it went to yes. the pick just went to yes&#039;s or no&#039;s and i figured i was just subconciously moving it or somethin then i put it away. that same night 10PM i took a couple puffs off my weed cart and i got really stoned that night so i didnt really know if this was real or not but i heard a knocking sound on my window. looked outside to see nothing, no human in sight nor did i see an animal. i was a bit freaked out but i managed to calm myself down and assure myself i was just paranoid and that it was probably just normal house noises or maybe my cat knocked something down in the next room. the next night completely sober and i heard the same noise again but this time there were exactly 2 knocks. an hour later i heard another knock on the window and i knew that must have been real. everynight since then i have heard a knock on my window. what do you thnk is happening internet?",

There&#039;s also a lot more symbolism in this game I can go deep into, but it would take hours.

Trying to condense the joys of life into a tiny window after a long day of work or a tiny weekend is not the way people should be expected to live. Normies are feel this tiredness and become extra vulnerable to various forms of mental poison such as the doomer mentality. This mentality is a byproduct of all social media algorithms discovering that cynical angry people stay around longer. And they&#039;re all so tired they don&#039;t have anywhere near as much energy as they should to be able to resist. And that just downward spirals as this makes them feel worse and worse and have less and less willpower.<br><br>The doomer irony poisoned mindset is affecting the world in such a terrible way that you can eve start to see people get angry at joy. People will call you out and try to stop you from simply being happy. They&#039;ll say you should be worrying about some problem they can&#039;t fix or try to undermine you for choosing to be happy when things are apparently so over. You can see it on plenty of boards here, fun silly threads get invaded by people trying to derail it into more rage bait as they just can&#039;t stand the idea of people being happy fun human beings instead of miserable whiners like everyone else. <br><br>It that leads to the creation of a black and white mindset. Life to these people becomes about winners and losers, they must at all times be the chad and their enemies are the wojack. You can&#039;t simply disagree, they are with you or against you. The world becomes less colorful as simply having a different opinion now sets you up for attack as your now marked as an enemy. You disagree with them is not an opinion but an attack at their very mind and will be responded with maximum hostility. Even religious stuff nowadays, especially Christianity, is no longer about the benefits of the beliefs, but about insisting how right you are and wrong everyone else is, it become self validation instead of enlightenment",

It&#039;s not a video game where you wear Immune to Poison gear and you can&#039;t get sick.<br><br>The first issue is that of viral loads. You can think of it as rolling dice, both in amount and frequency. The more virus you get, the better chance you get sick. There&#039;s little you can do to totally eliminate the risk, but you can reduce the amount of &#039;dice&#039; rolled, and thus reduce the chance. The easiest way to communicate this to the public is to simply say, &quot;wear masks&quot;<br><br>The second is how COVID is transmitted. Again, people wanted it to be like a video game: it&#039;s either transmitted via droplets or airborne. I played Plague Inc, so just tell me which tree it specced in!!!<br><br>But that&#039;s not how it works. There&#039;s a lot of overlap, as a &#039;droplet&#039; can be propelled a great deal by a cough or a sneeze. Further, if a droplet is small enough it essentially can stay in the air, forming an aerosol.<br><br>This didn&#039;t confuse scientists, but it did confuse the public and trying to message them. How can we say COVID is not airborne yet many of our precautions are similar to an airborne virus? It&#039;s a bit like an autist explaining what an RPG is and then getting mad when the normie says &quot;oh, like Zelda?&quot;<br><br>So the science never actually changed, but the messaging and definitions. This is because of an ignorant general public and another group of people - like you - who think they&#039;re experts on a subject after reading it for a few minutes.",

Especially the end poem gives some really evil kike vibes, and definitely doesn\u2019t seem fit for an innocent kid.

But many born into the eastern cultures have misconstrued this great law to mean that one should not interfere with the karmic destiny of another, either to hinder or to help him in his endeavours. This has been a grievous error in understanding, for it has allowed a continuation of suffering and pain where this might have been alleviated. The very action of refusing to help in such circumstances brings its own karmic consequences upon the person refusing.<br><br>Early in the Christian era, those in charge of the Christian message pondered the question of whether to teach the ancient truths of karma and rebirth to the members of the fledgling Christian church. After much debate, the church fathers decided to exclude these teachings. The reason for this decision was their observation of the philosophical error into which the people of the eastern culture had fallen. This is why the Christian teaching emphasizes above all else the commandment to serve one\u2019s brother in any way possible. For through this service it is possible not only to set aside one\u2019s karmic burden, but to lift the load from the shoulders of another.",

Their path is probably inverse to the path to gnosis many pure souls experience, which is usually following breadcrumbs placed by other initiated souls, and realizing that their job is now to place more breadcrumbs to lead more souls down the same route. I think certain souls are sent by the monad with this mission and are fated to have some sort of awakening, I\u2019d imagine more negative forces probably do the same shit. The path is probably really similar desu; just inverted, and I\u2019d guess their goal is basically to keep people incarnating in the system so these forces have more negativity to feed off of and propagate with. This would explain how some people are able to be so unbelievably evil, they probably know to some extent that this is a game and that they\u2019re just on the other team.",

They\u2019re empty souls who will never know some of the most joyous, fulfilling pleasures a man can experience. I would rather die in poverty than die rich knowing I could never listen to or enjoy good music again. They probably look at people who don\u2019t fuck children and feel the same.",

In the days of the caliphate, those who were not praying were tried and punished for heresy if they were adamant about their choices, and would not be get the proper muslim funerary service once they have passed away, as in muslims won&#039;t pray for their &#039;&#039;salvation&#039;&#039; and such, and in the most extreme of cases, won&#039;t even get buried in a muslim cemetery.<br>I don&#039;t know if the shias, particularly in Twelverism, are as strict about this issue. I do know that they their schools of interpretation have very varied understandings of how to prayer, including how many times it must be done on a daily basis, due to their dismissal of the regular Hadith corpus.",

Usually grizzly bears appear near the end of a dream, I am scarred of them, they either attack me and I wake up or i simply wake up after they appear (out of fear). I am not scarred of bear in real life, I see them in the same category as lions and tigers etc. Sometimes they take different forms. Few years ago I dreamed i broke a glass bear statue, then mama bear came and murdered my family while I hid. I usually have very lucid and vivid dreams. Ik they represent predators, but if it was that simple this motif wouldn&#039;t be reoccurring.",

Normalniggers can&#039;t just into muh &quot;Astral Body&quot; like you guys want. Those sorts of abilities are all predicated upon the same type of training that any of you who claim to understand &quot;Remote Viewing&quot; are capable of; most call it monkish or ascetic training, but it&#039;s just a refinement of the Soul and Apotheosis only really has one direction. This notion that you can be le super evil bad guy but somehow develop all the discipline needed to not just enter but hold Samadhi is fucking ludicrous. All of the evils of our world are fueled by the exact opposite natured processes. What fucking monk do you know runs around fueling all his Magic with Avarice and Sloth? That&#039;s retarded. Why do you people not feel like idiots for saying this shit? It&#039;s repugnant.",

As such, their derivation substantiates their inferiority. Those in question do not require these circles, banishments, amulets and so on that all of you think you need. You&#039;ll remember, having read enough of the books to participate in this conversation, that they all early on explain how Magic works in layers and the more layers you pile on, the more courtship and pageantry that distracts the feminine materializations, the more potent the Magic.

The idea you need to make a circle and sit in it or whatever else is entirely misunderstood. You take those steps to lock you into the mindstate necessary.

The thought suddenly giving me peace. Nowadays I don&#039;t think a sword, instead it&#039;s now a mechanism made of astral bodies and gears, a sort of power core but also an orrery, but it still radiates light, it still drives the shadows back, and I suspect this is the part of me which will not die even when I am gone, it&#039;s not my personality but certain qualities within me and others.<br>I suppose this is actual real mysticism, something deeply subjective but real nonetheless.",

It doesnt take scientists to see that a mind altering substance can cause degeneracy. But youre conflating the two and that&#039;s a faulty argument. A hammer is a tool that can both help build a house and help put a hole in someone&#039;s head. Someone intentionally using a hammer wrong and not respecting it for what it is will lead to stupid situations that could easily be avoided. Now, multiply the hammer scenario enough to the point where hammers are now wrongly associated as a murder weapon and are now illegal. This is literally what happened in the UK with fucking kitchen cutlery.<br><br>For thousands of years, various people have used it for religious ceremonies. Same with alcohol.

Granted pagans are usually far left or far right but that does not disqualify them from being sincere. I have met more &quot;cultural christians&quot; and people who blatantly ignore every word of their holy book except the lines that gives them free license to hate. In fact if you DIRECTLY QUOTE any of the constant lines about empathy, forgiveness, grace, how the poor are blessed and the rich cursed, turning the other cheek, etc from their holy book they mindlessly post pic related even if you are a fellow Christian. Why? It&#039;s not because they sincerely believe those lines are out of context. It&#039;s because they don&#039;t believe that the bible is the word of God or even divinely inspired. They believe that it gives them a reason why their hate/virginity is righteous and that is all they care about. They are literal larpers.",

Yeah, yeah...I know, most will respond with, &quot;but Jews wrote the Bible bro... it&#039;s all part of their scheme&quot;. Once you do enough research and reslize that Europeans are the lost tribes of Israel and the modern &quot;Jews&quot; are just corrupted Aryan mutts who have jewfros because they were part of a sect that abandoned the one true God in favor of a gay demon who convinced them to interbreed with lesser races, you&#039;ll get the bigger picture. Just take every lesson in the Bible and apply it as if only white people mattered, and suddenly it becomes the greatest doctrine for our success. Christianity is the key to our dominance over this world, which is why we were most successful when Europeans were predominantly Christian. Abandoning these beliefs is what led us astray. Jews have done a wonderful job of convincing many whites that our birthright was some phony text contrived by them, because that is what Jews do: they lie. We were most powerful when we BWC&#039;d the entire world in the name of God almighty, conquering every inch of land and spreading the name of the one that glorifies us. Now, ask yourself why Jews are so motivated in getting whites to abandon Christianity in favor of liberalism, paganism, and the worship of Doordash, Twitch, Pornhub and Netflix.",

They view the Gospel, ironically enough, in the same way atheists view it. Just a collection of stories rather than an active, lived philosophy. And most Christians practice Christianity, ironically enough, in the same way pagans do. It&#039;s a series of rites and rituals that are only preformed when needed rather than being an active, lived philosophy.<br><br>Christianity is, first and foremost, a guide on how to interact with the world around you, both real and meta-physical to ensure peak happiness and satisfaction with life (take that as you may). Part of this is making others happy (Matt 22:37-40). Any Christian who uses The Gospel to tear others down rather than building others up is, quite frankly, missing the point. This is why so many people are leaving the Church, and it&#039;s because atheists are right, in a sense. The version of Christianity so many devote themselves to is a false version, imagined in their own mind, that is twisted into what Atheists claim the Chruch to be. This contortion, in the modern day, is unsustainable as a form of spiritual sustainence.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TL;DR, OP is right and it&#039;s why Christianity is suffering in The West</span><br>My apologies for going full pastor.

I personally think a great culling was planned maybe with the vaccine and they used Covid as an excuse to kill inconvenient people. With Epstein\u2019s friends too he might have known about AI progress too. Too much crazy shit has happened in the last five years for there not to be more to this story than raping kids. Adrenochrome harvesting? Do you think they solved immortality and are killing off people who know?",
