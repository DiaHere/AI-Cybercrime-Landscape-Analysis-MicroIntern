No idea how to install it.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Turbo boost. Should be enabled already.</span><br>I downloaded some weird-ass &quot;Cinnamon spices&quot; addon that turned it on.

I just installed Win10 and it automatically got me the Legacy drivers and my laptop is now working like a charm. I hate to give Windows any credit but it just worked so well for this purpose. My games run smoothly now. Since this is my secondary computer maybe I&#039;ll accept that it&#039;s not Linux until I find out an easy way to install the drivers on Linux.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For download and activation: https://massgrave.dev/</span><br>How safe and legal is the Massgrave activation thing that you do in Powershell?

Owen Was Her&#039; from Touhou 6: Embodiment of Scarlet Devil. The video includes both the original track from the game by ZUN, but also an arranged version of the track by COOL&amp;CREATE, titled &#039;Final Brutal Sister Flandre S`. What most people don&#039;t know is that this latter track is a parody of the true last boss track from the CAVE arcade shoot&#039;em&#039;up Ketsui Kizunajigokutachi, titled &#039;NO REMORSE&#039;. The into to Final Brutal Sister Flandre S is an arrangement of the intro to NO REMORSE; hence, McRoll also includes a little bit of music from Ketsui.<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q16<wbr>KpquGsIc&amp;t=120<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3T<wbr>Z9t44nIo",

Goes without telling highest possible quality (you\u2019ll be sharing the large ass PNG files via gDrive or Mega or whateves, kindly).<br><br>2. Both posters gotta have color contrast synchronised (one being pristine white with digitized aspects and other being the scan of tarnished yellow physical copy [like shown in the later two replies below] won&#039;t do; both has to be pristine digitized final destination whitey collectible version).<br><br>3. Aspect ratio, widthXheight etc. has to match and assimilated. Want to leave no chance for illiterate dumbass local printing associates to consider stretching one to match other one. You understand.<br><br>4. Any extra touch to make things look perfect would be appreciated.<br><br>Thanks in advance. OP image is your gift. Might yield more, stick around.<br><br>More notes : I&#039;m seeing fonts in posters don&#039;t match, font colour scheme too.

        "com": "Anons, I seek for your HALP asap! I need to find out the exact name of one particular fantasy adventure or fantasy action movie that I&#039;ve never watched/seen up to this very day, but I only briefly saw it&#039;s short trailer just two times, on a VHS, in the early 2000&#039;s. I basically know nothing of it, other than what I saw in the trailer.<br><br>The only things I remember from that trailer are these several details:<br>1. It had a very &quot;late 80&#039;s ~ early 90&#039;s punk/rock/biker/metal scene&quot; look going to it, very dirty, dark, broody and edgy. Something akin to Terminator, or Escape From NY, or Dungeon Master-like, though it was definitely a fantasy movie and not pure action, because it featured magical elements in it.<br>2. The main &quot;hero&quot; (I only saw the trailer and only briefly, so I&#039;m not even sure that the person featured was movie&#039;s protag) was looking almost like Blackie Lawless in his &quot;prime&quot;, very edgy and &quot;punkish&quot;, metal and biker, draped in chains or metal sheets all over his leather clothes, or similar.<br>3. The trailer most certainly had a part where it was shown that there was some kind of a magical fairy (or even two, or more) that was helping the &quot;hero&quot;.<br>4. The &quot;hero&quot; was, if I recall it correctly, using some kind of a magical sword or other magic cold weaponry, and he was fighting against monsters or demons that were invading our world.<br>5. It is not alternate dimension and the &quot;hero&quot; is not being isekai&#039;d anywhere, he is fighting against demons/monsters in OUR world, which is distinctly late 80&#039;s or early 90&#039;s in how it looks.<br>6. The trailer&#039;s soundtrack was very heavy rock, punk, or straight up metal.<br>7. The movie was 100% live-action, it was not anime, cartoon, or animated.<br>8. All special effects depicting magic and environmental stuff were either practical, or &quot;drawn&quot; (like some of the special effects in Highlander were).<br>9. The magical fairy (or fairies) character in the trailer was either played by real human and miniaturized, or it was a very well done puppetry.",

        "com": "I&#039;ve always wanted to be a creative ever since I was young. I&#039;ve day dreamed about being one and tried working my ass off trying to write ever since I was around 12. My parents tried pushing me towards it for school assignments. I also wanted to draw but never got into it seriously.<br><br>I&#039;ve been wanting to write again for nearly 2 years now and have barely made any progress towards that goal. I&#039;ve only done one little drabble like 2 years ago and haven&#039;t done any exercises since then. I&#039;ve been trying to get myself to write, but all of it looks too complicated and exhausting for me. I&#039;ve tried multiple different strategies, but they never seem to work. I&#039;ve tried forcing myself to write, but can only make myself write a couple of sentences for barely 30 seconds before stopping and looking at my phone again.<br><br>I&#039;ve never been able to complete a single multichapter story in my entire life and actually coming up with stories isn&#039;t much better. I can&#039;t think anything through and everything about trying to make an entire story looks too hard for me. I want to be a creative really badly, but nothing I&#039;ve done seems to have amounted to much of anything. I want to become one so badly, and I want to stop wasting my life doing nothing.<br><br><br>Pic related is the only thing I&#039;ve managed to draw in a few months.",

Are you able to increase that fear? Harness the fear. Ride on its back.<br>The apathy makes it hard to feel anything, right? You are in a state of depression and that is making you not drawing or feel the fear of rotting away and not doing anything.<br>Tell me about your past. Has it always been like this? Or was there a starting point when the apathy set in?<br>What are your current living arrangements? What is the place like where you drew last time? Can you describe that desk?<br>You are a writer, right? Describe the place you were drawing at.<br>It&#039;s not easy for you. And it is, honestly, really mean how you were called names in the past.

You&#039;re a human and you deserve being heard.<br>I&#039;m trying to help you by understanding you a bit better. I can understand your point that you need help. It&#039;s, honestly, great that you&#039;re seeking help from people. There&#039;s lots of people who won&#039;t even reach out in the first place.

When prompted by her friends, she shows off her collection of hundreds of similar screenshots and explains that this is her &quot;hobby&quot;.<br><br>Any info is appreciated. If you don&#039;t have the video, but have seen it and know who the girl is, then it&#039;ll help narrow the search. I&#039;m not a kpopfag, so I&#039;m pretty fucked",

        "com": "Hello, I&#039;m trying to find the title of a Korean novel I read a while ago!<br><br>The main character is a guy. The story went like this:<br><br> (#)The main character was part of the royal family and since he was a mage, he was made into a king. He was... I&#039;m guessing betrayed betrayed because I vaguely remember he was put in jail. Anyhow, I believe his close friend came to help him and used magic on him to travel back in time.<br><br>The main character, now in the past, is a mage yet again. He&#039;s the strongest mage and becomes the &quot;mage head&quot; of the magic department of that kingdom. The king of that time period is hiding in a painting (?). I think? He was badly hurt, he left a note, and that note was read by the main character. Anyway.<br><br>The story spends a big focus on the current king&#039;s children. Among these children, there is a pair of twins and the main character wants to help one of them because he knows one of them is the future king. There were paintings of the kings in the future and one of the kings looked the same except there was a big scar on the king&#039;s face. So, one of the twins will have a scar on his face (I vaguely recall the twin&#039;s name being &quot;Jin&quot;). The twins were also young, like... maybe 10 year old?<br><br>During the fight for the throne, one of the kid ultimately gets a scar so the main character dedicates himself to helping that kid to the throne. During the... &quot;mana awakening ceremony&quot;, the other twin is discovered to be a demon and he&#039;s killed off.<br><br>Other stuff I remember was another 10 year time skip when the main character goes into a weird... &quot;portal&quot;, in another country? Not sure. Oh, there was also a time when they went into a village, there was a talking dog, which turned out to be a human soul inside a dog. The soul was the one from a necromancer race, I think.<br><br>(1/2)",

I just want a show that manages to make things as tense as kaiji. Like its hard to explain but they really just draw everything out without making it boring or overdone. They really make you feel every move like you&#039;re going through it along with him. Just so many shows don&#039;t do that where I kinda feel out of it, unimmersed like an observer, and I kinda don&#039;t care what happens. Also not to downplay the stakes of kaiji but I feel like the show sorta is able to make the little things seem like a huge deal.",

        "com": "I have been procrastinating this for a long time. I have three operating systems on my Surface Laptop 3 13.5\u201d: Windows, Linux Mint 21.1 Cinnamon, and Fedora Linux (6.4.14-200.fc38.x86-64) 38 (Workstation Edition). Fedora was installed after Linux Mint. When I installed Fedora, Linux Mint wouldn&#039;t boot from the GRUB installed by Fedora, but it would still boot from the GRUB installed by Linux Mint (but that&#039;s not the issue I am concerned with here).<br><br>One day (around 6 months ago), I wanted to allocate more storage to the Windows partition and less to the partition containing Fedora. I did this from GParted on a live USB containing Fedora Linux 37 (Workstation). It worked, but after doing so, I noticed that my Fedora would no longer boot from GRUB. Because Windows would still boot, I didn&#039;t give this much attention for a while.<br><br>Now, around six months later, I&#039;ve come back to this issue. I notice that Fedora will still not boot, but for some reason Linux Mint is able to boot from the GRUB installed by Fedora now. Using Linux Mint as well as the GRUB (version 2.06) command line, I was able to see that the partition used to access vmlinuz-6.4.14-200.fc38.x86_64 and initramfs-6.4.14-200.fc38.x86_64.im<wbr>g still contained those files and retained the same UUID. The root partition for Fedora also contained the same files and retained the same UUID as before. When I boot Fedora without the &quot;rhgb quiet&quot; option, the boot hangs at &quot;Booting a command list&quot;.<br><br>Perhaps more concerning is the fact that I could no longer boot from the exact same live USB as before. Thinking it might be a live USB issue, I tried using Fedora Media Writer to create a live USB with the same exact version of Fedora that it contained previously, but the result was the same (hangs when trying to boot from GRUB).<br><br>Any ideas?<br><br>(for tldr, just read the title of this post)",

This should regenerate the GRUB entry in /boot or /efi and fix the mistakes introduced when you shrunk the Fedora partition and then GRUB will just work. Now, if that doesn&#039;t work, you can manually boot/chainload from GRUB, where you issue a series of commands issue options, the kind of stuff GRUB is meant to automate. I did this a few times to get into a FreeBSD partition and it was a bit of a hassle but you can figure it out.<br><br>Worst case scenario, take what&#039;s valuable from the Fedora partition and reinstall it.",

We anticipate the Switch 2 will run largely the same system software as the Switch 1, and we&#039;re all out of software bugs.

You can download it from wherever you get Switch ROMs or from<br>https://f010479.twinquasar.io/ipfs/<wbr>QmUGpRGDW1ZZgJygGqbA9eChrid4Xyb1yEK<wbr>mirsRKuHup5<br>(CAR file, extract it with go-car or another program)<br><br>It&#039;s a two-in-one game. Put it in your Switch hardware or Switch emulator. I think I 100-percented the newer one, and I 100-percented the older one minus beating each level as every character. I played it (and beat all of what I said I beat) all with WASD for character movement and Z button for the run button. That was an annoying and awkward setup. Use shift for the run button when playing in the Suyu emulator. I think you can only jump off of Bowser Jr.&#039;s head a max of 2 or 3 times when in the air; impossible to get more bounces after that without landing on the ground.<br><br>Thinking about these games in general, the original Super Mario Bros. from 1985 is a difficult game to beat without cheating or anything. The Cheep-Cheeps are very annoying in &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; - probably my most disliked enemy.",

Go to the IP address of that computer in the LAN and you can watch videos from your storage devices; you can watch vids while lying in bed using a smartphone. I did this and got brain damage after watching all 720 episodes of &quot;Naruto&quot; and &quot;Naruto: Shippuden&quot; in order without skipping any filler episodes.<br><br>I also recommend watching those two cartoons/animes. But only if you skip the filler. If you were like me and thought you could watch every episode without skipping, you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re getting into. You can watch the filler later after watching the main story. Normally I&#039;d cringe at such a suggestion, but it depends on your mental state and what you want. You can either:<br>1. Want to just watch something, really not caring if it&#039;s particularly interesting or not. It just has to be better than nothingness = watch filler and every episode of &quot;Naruto&quot; and &quot;Naruto: Shippuden&quot; without skipping<br>2. Want to watch an interesting series: watch those two series but make sure to skip certain episodes via using a filler list guide.<br><br>My favorite Naruto characters (tossup on #3 and #4 places):<br>1. Orochimaru<br>2. Madara Uchiha<br>3. Hiruzen Sarutobi (maybe)<br>4. Might Guy OR Kakashi Hatake",

In many experiments, the recipient&#039;s head has not been removed, but in others it has been. Experimentation in animals began in the early 1900s. As of 2025, no lasting successes have been achieved.[1][2]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[...]Transplantation of a dog-head performed in the USSR by Vladimir Demikhov on 1954</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[...]In 1954, Vladimir Demikhov, a Soviet surgeon who had done important work to improve coronary bypass surgery, performed an experiment in which he grafted a dog&#039;s head and upper body including the front legs, onto another dog; the effort was focused on how to provide blood supply to the donor head and upper body and not on grafting the nervous systems. The dogs generally survived a few days; one survived 29 days. The grafted body parts were able to move and react to stimulus. The animals died due to transplant rejection.[1]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[...]In 2013, Sergio Canavero published a protocol that he said would make human head transplantation possible.[5][6] In 2016, he announced his plans to do the procedure on Valeriy Spiridonov, a disabled Russian software engineer suffering from spinal muscular atrophy, who volunteered for the surgery. Canavero claimed that there is a 90% chance of success. In the proposed procedure, a body would be donated from a brain-dead living patient.[7] However, Spiridonov later cancelled his participation after getting married and having his first child.[8]</span><br><br><a href=\"#p1533205\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1533205</a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; <a href=\"#p1533169\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;1533169</a> [me]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &gt;Didn&#039;t like the vocaloid one</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; I didn&#039;t like vocaloid ever neither, but that one I found to be a banger.

Once I unplug it, all the actions I tried doing resume or unfreeze, resulting in a bunch of errors and me being able to use my pc again. It will even prevent my pc from turning off when i go to reset it, just giving an infinite spinning wheel until i unplug it. It does show up in device manager when it gets plugged in, but it says there are no driver updates available. <br><br>I havent tried another cable since its an old model and uses a type of cable I dont have a spare of. <br><br>How do I get my stuff back?",
