All the HAES nonsense vanishes the moment dropping weight becomes effortless. Fat people aren&#039;t oppressed, they&#039;re just addicted to comfort and food. But the second you remove the struggle, they fold instantly. And honestly, it&#039;s in the country\u2019s best interest. Obesity isn&#039;t just a personal issue, it&#039;s a national burden, dragging down healthcare, productivity, even the military.

Everything that uses bodily resources that&#039;s not doing its job properly gets recycled. Also raises your growth hormone by a shitload, as does sprinting.

Don&#039;t do it too often, if your body gets used to it you don&#039;t get the growth hormone increase. <br><br>Learn to endure physical strain and mental adversity. If you push the right buttons in your body and keep the mechanisms alive that our ancestors depended on at the very limits of their mental and physical abilities to survive, you are going to stay in good shape for as long as possible, mentally and physically.

How much are you really spicing up your appearance if it&#039;s permanent? If it&#039;s just the same picture in the same place, every day, in every situation? The ideal thing to serve the purpose of novelty and attracting attention would be to hang a TV or an LED sign around your neck. That way you can show people the aesthetix that&#039;s on your mind at all times, up to the minute. Anything less is frankly bland, played out, done to death, passe, old hat. And what&#039;s worse, you can&#039;t just take it off when it goes out of style! You have to pay money for that! 5-10x what it cost to get it put on in the first place!

Women go crazy for &#039;boysmell&#039;. My old fwb asked me to leave a pillow at her place, later on told me it was because the smell was reassuring and made her feel safe on some nights.

I mean easily. Also use incredibly light weight for the same reason. This is mostly a tendon strengthening exercise at first to bulletproof the forearms.<br><br>Rest elbow on a mat, chair, etc like you&#039;re doing forearm curls.<br>Now hold the hammer (I say hammer because dumbbells can feel suboptimal on the motion of the weight) at the very bottom.<br>You start with the hammer facing inward and lift it slowly up to straight in the air. Now gently allow it to fall back inward. That is one rep.<br>Repeat outward, starting outward, go up, one rep.<br>Increase weight as necessary until about 15-20lbs.<br>Drop weight to starting weight again once conditioned after a few weeks.<br>Now start inward, go all the way to outward in a controlled motion, pause, now go all the way inward. That is one.<br>After you repeat this on the next arm for a complete set, repeat, but start outward-inward-outward.<br>Always change up the order after each set. It matters because of the muscle activation.<br><br>Do not skip the process, do not try to fireax your first try, do not start holding your arm straight up (always held down on a surface nice and controlled).<br>If you skip a process considering the sheer amount of tendons in your forearm. You will cripple yourself. Make sure you supplement collagen in some form (I eat a lot of broth via soups and stews for reference daily).<br>After about a year you should be pretty close to max weight, I said wood cutting axe and I openly admit i&#039;m retarded. I meant my sledge hammer not sure why I said ax, that&#039;s only like 10lbs.<br><br>I digress, you&#039;ll have huge forearms and your grip will be absurdly strong. Your tendons will also guarantee never need to be strengthened again in the forearm. Most people compensate weight through the entire arm/shoulder.<br>20-30lbs directly at the forearm and only the forearm is absurdly strong.",

As long as you can admit you are a pussy and don&#039;t want crazy gains, it&#039;s whatever.",

Afternoon session was cut short for a number of reasons. I managed to get in 1 sprint, all of my jumps, and tested crab walks to warm up. I normally just do bear crawls, but will add in the crab walks. I can hit a good table, so I did not think the crab walks would be too tough. Just need some practice.

Ran a little low on time and had to get off the rack for someone else so I was unable to do the sumo holds. No real pain, just the hip flexor. Glute and knee are progressing which is nice, not as worried about them anymore. The hip thing I could probably ignore as its always been kind of sore and clicky for years, but should not be happening so I am fixing it. I would notice it more after sumo pulling. Also, you need strong hip flexors for gymnastics so I am working on them more. They are not a visible body part and most of your barbell exercises don&#039;t require strong hip flexors so people don&#039;t work on them as much.

The more you reveal something for what it truly is, and the less you figuratively or literally cover it up with socially enforced rules, the more obvious their natural worth is assessed and the easier it is to place everyone in a social hierarchy, which women hate for themselves but love doing to men.<br>To women, being superior without actually doing anything to anyone else but existing in their presence is &quot;oppression&quot;. Their entire psyche is built on resentment and jealousy.",

Usually you have one to organize and streamline a function for a unified goal, but working out is usually a personal goal. If you need help, then the gym with provide the resources you need.

I wake up every day smiling, knowing my body is built to improve both my mind and my health. If I ever lose my gains, I\u2019ll get them back in no time without any downsides to my health and with plenty of benefits. I couldn\u2019t imagine going bald, becoming infertile, or even finding myself attracted to trannies unironically let alone drastically compromising my health just to skip the hard work and get a short\u2011lived reward. Those \u201cgains\u201d vanish the moment you stop sticking a needle in your ass every morning. Roidtrannies need to be shamed every single day. Rotrannie Colefag, Arnold schtranny, Miketrannie, etc. Those faggots must be seen for what they are: losers and absolute failures as men and as human beings. Natural bodybuilding is the only real bodybuilding. Eugen Sandow would be ashamed of all these faggots.",

Theres this younger guy at the gym I befriended and so we hung out sometimes, I especially latching on to opportunities because I had nothing back home for years and years and Thailand offers new beginnings. Since we were both sick and not training Muay Thai for a week or so, we basically met up today and spent the whole time smoking weed. I basically got lifemogged so hard it&#039;s unreal. He basically didn&#039;t give a fuck about his first time and just got it out of the way with some random thai girl hes been dating casually, and whiles he been here a shorter time than me, he&#039;s much more bold and adventurous and it comes easy to him, exploring the local avenues and befriending people as well as women. Meanwhile, I&#039;m so crippling defective from years of being a shutin, even though I have the literal capability to do more, I struggle to actually act on it. For him what&#039;s comes effortlessly and without the jaded cynicism of years gone by with things slowly degrading, is an insurmountable task or a small hero&#039;s journey all on its own for me. I&#039;ve never really made friends back in the States, so it&#039;s almost an alien concept here, as much as I try to be friendly. He even asked if he&#039;s the only friend I made since here. That hippy girl I met weeks ago must&#039;ve caught the same loser vibes from me which is why she invited me out from a place of pity. And I even feel like I facials MOG him, he just has so much more XP in these arenas it&#039;s unreal. Hotter ex&#039;s than girls I ever could hope to attain probably. I feel like there&#039;s some genetic or epigenetic marker he has that I don&#039;t that allows him to succeed as such<br><br>I&#039;m going to try and enjoy my lengthy trip as much as possible, but I fear after years and years of being heavily conditioned to just room rot, it may be too late and the eventual conlusion to my story always ends the same, by my own hand.",

Our values and life goals meshed, we had similar sense of humour, you name it. We wrote letters to each other since both liked that. Conversing with her was just easy and pleasant, a better connection than I can remember having with anyone for years. Better than in some of my previous relationships. We were talking about spending time at a summer cabin she rents every year... and then she pulled the rug out from under me. &quot;I dont feel we&#039;re truly on the same level in our communication.&quot; Apparently I&#039;m too down to earth analytical while she&#039;s pondering philosophical and doesnt get the stimulus she needs from me. Of course her being like that was one of the reasons I liked her. And yet we had more in common than I had with most of my exes. So that hurt. A lot. <br><br>On the plus side I&#039;ve gone down 2kg in 1,5 weeks on top of everything previous. I&#039;ve got ways to go but the process feels easy and pleasant (since CICO works). Lifts have now stalled but havent gone backwards. I adjusted my program accordingly. I&#039;m getting a new better bench with some accessries for my home gum. I also have a good friend who has supported me when I&#039;ve been down. I&#039;m getting pangs of loneliness and depression but with some good old excercise and white monster everything is possible. And being alone is familiar to me by now anyway.",

Today I decided to walk to a nearby park that I haven&#039;t been able to go to due to my health issues. Making the journey alone was a real test for my recovering body, but I strapped on my back brace and headed out. While walking I kept calculating whether my body could handle the journey back but I made it to the park and decided to keep going. A good ways inside I made it to a creek that was overflowing through the path and it started to rain so I had to turn around. The way back was uphill and I had to hurry before the storm hit. Forcing my nerves and muscles to reconnect, my heartrate and breathing elevated, sweating and pushing myself, felt fucking great. Got home, showered and felt that familiar post-workout relaxation while listening to the rain and thunder. Pic related, the turnaround point.",

Spoke here and there every few months since, nothings ever come of it.<br>She\u2019s been begging to see me last few months, had a week off so told her to come here on the 4th. She was all on board and then just never bought her ticket until it was too expensive. Prices dropped then she spent 3 hours packing a days worth of get fucked clothes and it sold out. Then a day later started yelling at me on the phone saying I should have paid for her ticket so I hung up after explaining I wasn\u2019t going to argue and that I wasn\u2019t going to spend my money on a ticket for a girl who has proven to be incredibly flakey.<br>Last we spoke like a week later that\u2019s the dynamic now, she demands I pay for her ticket. I\u2019m not doing that. Like it\u2019s a game to make me waste money. She\u2019s broke unemployed not in school but idgaf. She said she could drive but then that was no longer and option either.

I can follow basically any video and maybe a blue print type diagram showing me what to do. After my 3rd time doing the thing I have memorized. For example I had to watch videos on changing tires on the side of the highway a few times. Now I can just do it it\u2019s easy. I had to replace a side view mirror recently, after following the video for my specific car once I can do it again without the video. No one just knows stuff, even total savant retards have to at least look up instructions. Your generation like mine isn\u2019t being taught stuff that was previously handed down without anyone asking. Ask, fuck anyone who treats you like shit for trying to learn.

This was only 3 years ago, and in hindsight the shit I worried about then was really not bad, and the shit I worry about now are inescapable realities about my situation and the people around me.<br><br><br><a href=\"#p76399390\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;76399390</a><br>Just having your shit relatively in order seems enough to mog anyone 18+ these days.",

You\u2019ll obtain both of those desires after you pass, so use that as motivation. You can do it! You\u2019ve put in so much effort so far, so don\u2019t let it go to waste.",

My rumination and negative self-talk is gone. My anxiety is gone. I rarely even post on 4chan these days. I lost so much weight i&#039;m almost at my all time lowest weight since high school. I freely talk to people even if i shut down sometimes when it gets &quot;deeper&quot; and i know i&#039;m about to exchange contacts and get the longtime connection, but i&#039;m still working on it. People start talking to me for no fucking reason and it&#039;s always a good conversation, but just a couple months ago i could only talk to alcoholics on the street. People tell me i look great. Women fucking love me. I&#039;m discovering my own fashion style, i even managed to talk to a very hot girl in some hipster thrift store for 15 or so minutes and she said she would be happy to see me again. My calendar is full of concerts, raves and festivals i want to go to and on every single one of them i&#039;m going to have fun and find more great people to talk to.<br><br>I think i&#039;m going to make it. This is NOT a manic phase of depression, i went to a funeral and didn&#039;t spiral back into negativity, i&#039;m still standing strong. People from this thread and feels bar helped me more than i could admit but holy fuck i&#039;m making it.",

Just couldn&#039;t do it in the allotted timeframe. <br><br>On the plus side, now that it&#039;s out of the way I can get back to working without hesitation. Found a place that is hiring, and it&#039;s very close to my old gym, maybe a 4 or 5 minute drive. The job is more warehouse work, which I really wanted to get out of, but at this point I don&#039;t have a choice because I need money plain and simple and I&#039;m confident I can get the job with a decent interview, and it starts off around 20 an hour which isn&#039;t bad for my area and would let me easily afford to reinstate my gym membership. Even if that one fucks up though, an old coworker whose brother I&#039;m friends with is hiring again for decent money too. <br><br>Then another friend of mine got a bike frame from a shop and is fixing it up. Told me he thinks it&#039;s big enough for me so I can come try a ride with him and his group. It&#039;s not the most exciting thing in the world but it beats spending yet another weekend unemployed in my room playing fucking marvel rivals. <br><br>Life is not very good right now, but I am doing my best to persevere. I did find out however that one of my favorite bands will be playing about 3 hours away from me very soon. If I can land either of these jobs and save up the funds I might try to go.",

The way i do it is that every night in my bed before i sleep i come up with three things that i am grateful for. Even if i&#039;ve had a completely shit day i have to come up with three.<br><br>For example:<br>Pretty much nothing good or even remarkable happened today but<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I had a pizza that was good</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;My nose isn&#039;t stuffed</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I replayed an old vidya i like</span><br><br>Even if none of these are remarkable and some are even bad for me, i won&#039;t let that keep me from being grateful for it. When i consciously decide to appreciate them i train my brain, like a muscle, to appreciate more things in everyday life.<br><br>Again, it takes time, but after a few months you will notice that when you go to bed you will manage to find a lot more than just three things to be grateful for. You will appreciate the times for being good both when recalling them and when you are living in them <br><br>Shit days will always feel like shit, nothing can change that, much like how 250 lbs will always be heavy. Despite that, you can train your muscles to handle the pressure of 250 lbs and you can train your mind to handle a bad day.<br><br>It takes time, begin with three things you appreciate.",

The reason is the levels of nutrients inside cells aren&#039;t reflected in blood levels, while concentrations across the body may vary. So with potassium, you can have minute levels constantly flowing in and out the cell, and showing up as &quot;normal&quot; in the blood, while having functionally impaired levels throughout the body.<br><br>The best way to know if you&#039;re nutritionally deficient is to look at your diet, imo. Cause blood tests are useless and you only develop severe diseases from poor nutrition when something is completely absent (very rare.)

Its about how ironic/fashionable you are.<br><br>Let me break it down for you, big boy.<br><br>Fashion is all about projecting status and personality, but mainly status. Think about why people want to dress different. They want to express who they are, how much money they have, what they&#039;re into, where they&#039;ve been, what they do, they want to fit into a mould of a person they want to be. Status isnt the exclusive reason people like to dress nice but its certainly one of them.<br><br>So, when someone wears an anime T-shirt, someone will unconsciously look at you and go &quot;Is this person ironically/fashionably wearing this T-shirt or not&quot;. <br><br>The reason some people can wear shit like picrelated is because it portrays status i.e. they&#039;re rich. Now if someone tried dressing like this with clothes from goodwill they&#039;d be laughed at for being autistic<br><br>So in the context of wearing an anime Tshirt the question is: does this guy ironically wear anime tshirts and is otherwise cool or is he an autist?<br><br>I would argue its the rest of your fashion choices, haircut and projected status that matters more than how much you can bench. Autists can be buff too",

Growing up i was autistic as fuck. completely terrified of romantic interaction. prohibitively unattractive personality and mien. fate aligned a few times and got me laid, probably at the expense of the girls&#039; self worth each time. but I absolutely could not pursue a female. age 22 I start lifting religiously and focusing on diet. I hide in the house, working out in the backyard for 2 years, never going out. my newfound leanness and muscularity completely morphs my body and face. I&#039;m 6&#039;3 with abs and a v taper and broad shoulders with a full chest. I have thick full lips and a square jaw with deep blue eyes. I look like a fucking stud. I decide to unveil my new self at the bar, seeking redemption for prior missteps of dropped spaghetti. I walk in, a girl immediately offers to buy me a drink. fight or flight kicks in and I say I don&#039;t like those drinks. <br><br>I go outside by myself for a minute to flush out the norepinephrine coursing through my veins. I look in the window, some girls are giggling, looking, and wave. I manage to wave confidently. I get up and go to the bar before they can find me. I&#039;m hiding, not facing the rest of the bar so I don&#039;t become too frightened. I order a drink. I feel someone squeeze my traps from behind. I deadlift almost 500lbs so they&#039;re juicy. I turn around and a cute slut says<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;:) you&#039;re the hot guy with the white sneakers</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I look down and make sure I&#039;m the hot guy in the white sneakers</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sneakers are white so I guess that&#039;s me</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;uh, I guess&quot; </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cascade of catecholamines is rushing through my body.

It was posited that the musclegirl fetish is a part of the &quot;safe horny&quot; phenomenon, where modern-day young men only feel comfortable expressing their sexuality in a semi-ironic and non-threatening way -- i.e. by assuming a submissive rather than assertive sexual posture, expressing desire for a dominant woman, etc. Many people adopting this strategy will attempt to retain plausible deniability in doing so (&quot;haha jk... unless...&quot;). Some users believed that this may be a result of young men reaching sexual maturity during the height of the #MeToo era, in which normal male sexuality was often demonized.",

The basic idea was that you want to limit how much you&#039;re on the gear in general, because most people don&#039;t have the funds or access or desire for weekly, or biweekly bloodwork to make the tweaks for the primary or ancillary meds. So you blast E for a 3 month cycle and vibe the ancillaries to get the most gains, while limiting sides. And if you need to, you cruise on C.

You are a relatively attractive white woman from a decent, upper-middle class family, who has never been told &quot;no&quot;, or that she couldn&#039;t have something. You go from relationship to relationship sowing chaos, getting elbow deep in other peoples lives, and causing an enormous shitshow, all because your &quot;bestie&quot; told you to do it &quot;for the plot&quot;. Any problem that does exist in your life is simply a result of your behavior and reputation catching up to you, simply because you have never had any actual issues in your life and require constant drama (with attention directed at you) in order to get through the day. Everyone is tired of you and your antics, but unfortunately it&#039;s not worth bringing up because you will again attempt to make it about yourself and pretend to be a victim. You are not quirky, you are not complex, you are a carbon copy of a hundred thousand women exactly like you. Your streak of neon hair, your sleeve of tats that you pretend has some profound, esoteric meaning, are so similar to any number of your peers that they are forgettable and not worthy of mention. Likewise, your &quot;bestie&quot; and other friends actively sabotage one another to make each other undesirable as long term partners, meaning less time apart from &quot;the girls.&quot;<br><br>You have never been rebellious. The illusion of success you either have or pursue was crafted explicitly for you by businessmen in board meetings or over rounds of golf in order to bolster revenue. You are acting in a manner that society collectively shrugs over, because we expect it and can spot it a mile away.",

Women&#039;s natural psychological drive is to push boundaries to test the solidity of the boundary setters (men). It&#039;s like pushing against the walls of a house to see if the roof caves in. Problem is, we as men have let women as a collective push against and through all the social and sexual boundaries that kept society going in any productive or meaningful way, and now we live in this sort of limbo where nothing truly meaningful can be produced yet we still pay the cost as if it were.<br>To repair this situation, we would need to subjugate and enslave women to a level not ever seen in society, in order to counter the effects of similiarly unprecedented freedom. Since that is about as likely to happen as the sun not rising tomorrow, the next best thing is to let the whole thing completely collapse and return to basics.<br>Women will quickly realise their value when society returns to a primitive, savage state and their fake degree and e-mail job isn&#039;t worth a damn anymore.

From there I really fell down the rabbithole of Templar chants, and now I just have a playlist that I built up over time. Most of it is Christian chants (I am not Christian btw), so generally speaking I have a YouTube section that is full of random Gregorian choirs. If you want a good beginner friendly playlist look up Patrick Lenk and you&#039;ll end up finding your tones. I really love baritone chanting, so I&#039;ll usually save the ones that fit that, but sometimes you get some really good sopranos that hit it right (Catholics putting them eunichs to work)",

Constantly overreaching, sore or too hungover to put more weight on the bar, since recovery and drinking don&#039;t go together. <br>Not to mention the mental health hit, anxiety and times I wanted to die because of spiraling or doing dumb shit while drunk.<br>For a time I stopped drinking because I wasn&#039;t living alone anymore. It was tough, but I had a full time job + uni + chores to fill the time. Did some time on antidepressants and that worked for a bit, since drinking on them is a no-no.<br>Now I&#039;m living alone again and am managing to stay away from the bottle, but weed and other substances do fill that role partially. Weed is okay as long as you smoke 2-3 hours away from bedtime since it fucks up sleep quite a bit.<br>I do sometimes have a beer with a friend at a bar, but that&#039;s about it. And I feel like crap afterwards every time. My body just stopped accepting it as something normal. Gym&#039;s going well for the first time ever and the progress is what keeps me going. <br><br>So I guess find someone that keeps you accountable, fill your time with stuff, focus on gym progress (which is much easier off booze), switch to something else or wait for your body to age, as drinking past 25yo stopped being much fun for me.",

Maybe its to forget, maybe its to fit in more, maybe its to reduce the anxiety or depression that is ever present in the back of your mind. In any case the short term solution of alcohol might make it seem like its patching things up but it is making your life worse. In these cases the solution is to quit alcohol completely and seek therapy to work out why you feel so insecure, so depressed, so traumatised that poisoning yourself seems like a sane thing to do.",

I&#039;ve been trying to go A2G, admittedly the past few weeks where I continued my working out after a few weeks break due to physiotherapy (which despite my worries in hindsight doesn&#039;t seem to have been related to squats/DL in this instance, but is where I got suggestions regarding heels and not going below parallel) I wasn&#039;t really going below parallel, yet before that when I was trying 3x5 (advised by physio to go for higher rep ranges thus the change) and not even compensating my femurs (which probably made my form more questionable, but I digress) I was slowly making progress and lifting twice as much. Particularly now even this feels daunting to the point I can&#039;t see how I was managing 3x5.<br><br>Is there any way at this point to fix my squat troubles? Don&#039;t feel like there&#039;s much of a point for me to keep going if I can&#039;t fix this.

The point is that the money is running out so I need to get back to working, even if it&#039;s just to float a dead end neet-adjacent life for however much longer I can. I can learn later and on my own spare time but I need to earn right now.

Point merchants have the advantage of energy conservation because they just need to out score you and not get submitted. This is why you need to be brutal and hunt submissions at any cost. When I competed, if I didn&#039;t get a submission in the first 5 minutes I basically gave up because I would be out of energy. But I won more tournaments than I lost because I was a better wrestler and would hunt for darce, rnc, arm bar, kimura and triangles. I only went for high percentage submissions. If I started those on most people in the first five minutes I would win.",

I hit a wall around 10-12 pull-ups, started sprinting, and it was smooth sailing to 20. My sprinting would get better, then I would get another rep or two like clockwork. Calistenics is much more holistic with how you improve and learn skills. You can fail a skill for not having good cardio, strength, balance, or mobility in various areas. Just being strong enough is not normally enough.",

The way I say it is that fat loss is the goal, not weight loss unless you&#039;re a real fucking chonker. Remember that muscle weighs more than fat, so putting on muscle while losing fat, depending on the rate, will actually level out your weight loss. The mirror is your friend. Add cardio for fat loss, but not the autistic variety. Light jogs help a ton. /roon might be a good place to check out",

Overweight/obese people, beginners, and roiders are the groups that can do both at the same time, and you are in two of those groups. But for the lifting to work, I think you&#039;ll need to drop the fasting because you need regular protein doses to build muscle. You&#039;ll need to keep a calorie deficit but still eat regular meals. Fasting is good for short term, drastic weight loss, but is not sustainable long term.",

He found a young boy on the battlefield, and raised him like his own, but he was a piece of shit, and abused this kid growing up in various ways, including selling him as a sex slave to a nigger. That kid was named Guts, and he accidentally killed Gambino, which effectively exiled him from their group. After getting mauled by wolves, he wandered the land as a sword for hire. One day, a fagboy twink named Griffith noticed how cool Guts was, and he convinced him to join his group, the Band of the Hawk. Griffith and Guts became very close, which made his tsundere fangirl Casca big mad.<br><br>They fought in battles and were an unstoppable force, which garnered the attention of royalty, and earned them a lucrative position as royal guardsmen, and Griffith became involved in the royal court. Some shit goes down, and ultimately, Griffith seduces and rapes the king&#039;s daughter, for which he is summarily stripped of his position and thrown into a dank dungeon somewhere. Even though Guts left the group around this time, he comes back to help his friends spring Griffith from the joint, but Griffith isn&#039;t happy to be a shell of his former self (he was tortured beyond recognition), so he wishes upon his red egg talisman and summons the Satanic Panic, who make him into an edgy bat god, but only in exchange for allowing demons to slaughter all his friends. He also rapes Casca after she and Guts fell in love, which makes Guts big mad and hell bent on revenge.<br><br>Some more shit goes down; Guts travels the land with the express purpose of murdering demons; Casca is a vegetable because post rape PTSD; some new party members are added, each with their own fucked up problems and shit, but also with unique abilities; they travel to some gay island to fix Casca&#039;s brain; meanwhile Griffith and his demons are merging the spirit realm and the physical realm, and building his dream kingdom of Falconia.",

But in order to truly enjoy this process, your mindset/approach for lifting and for each specific workout must be extremely exact, deliberate, and intense. write down your weights and reps for every lift. follow a schedule. each time you go to the gym your only goal is to do one more rep or 5 more pounds than you did last time on each particular lift. its all about progressive overload, and this necessitates being very exact and deliberate. if you can truly embrace this mindset, amazing results are guaranteed as are feelings of ecstasy. <br><br>there&#039;s no just going to the gym when you can or when you feel like it and putting on whatever weight you&#039;re feeling like doing, and doing however many reps youre feeling. there&#039;s a fucking science to it",

Research has shown that testosterone receptors are found throughout the brain, including in regions involved in motivation, reward, and decision-making (Bhasin et al., 2010). It has been linked to a range of behaviours, including competition and challenging, risk-taking, and sexual behaviour, due to its impact on liido.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;One way in which testosterone impacts the brain is by influencing the release of dopamine. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in the reward and motivation pathways. Research has shown that testosterone can increase the release of dopamine in response to a reward (Wood et al., 2014). This effect is particularly pronounced in males, who tend to have higher levels of testosterone and a stronger dopamine response to rewards than females.</span><br><br>https://www.edenclinic.co.uk/post/t<wbr>estosterone-and-the-brain<br><br>And<br><br>https://youtu.be/ClxRHJPz8aQ?si=mrW<wbr>hET5z-xL8Xqan&amp;t=3251",

Getting exercise is one thing that helps keep it manageable. <br>I used to not enjoy being at the gym. I would usually be uncomfortable with all the people around me. That was until one day, when I decided to stop browsing my phone between sets. Instead of browsing my phone, I just sat down or stood near the bar and just stared into space and did nothing. At first this was very uncomfortable, far more uncomfortable than checking my phone, but after a a couple of weeks something began to change. <br>Now when I&#039;m at the gym, my anxiety completely fades away. In the first half of my gym session I spend the time between sets letting my mind wander and thinking about my life. By the time the second half of my session arrives I have already run out of thoughts and I&#039;m just chilling, letting my mind be empty, listening to the sounds of the gym. <br>Since this change I have become more confident than 80% of people at my gym. I&#039;m more confident than some people with actually impressive physiques. I am HAPPY in the gym. I would say I smile and wave to people, but these days most people quickly look away if they accidentally make eye contact with you. <br><br>It&#039;s not just for me, I think when you do nothing, you&#039;re giving yourself time to reflect on all of the thoughts that usually nag at you during the day. When I&#039;m at the gym, I give my brain time to empty itself of all of it&#039;s thoughts, it&#039;s basically a form of meditation.",

Yeah, it&#039;s a historical bias. If you only have 36 pictures in a roll of film which you then had to develop which you then had to actually fucking save in a physical photo album, you&#039;re not going to waste those shots on a dude that looks like that even if it represented 99.9999% of humanity (it didn&#039;t, but you get the point).",

Whether or not he can save himself and get attention from the opposite gender was the main point of the discussion. Also, being /fit/ doesn&#039;t garner you respect from people, it&#039;s being ATTRACTIVE that makes people respect you. Lifting is simply an addon. He can lift all he wants and even roid if he wants to. When people see a sub 5&#039;7, norwood 4, recessed chin male they&#039;re going to be disgusted by him. You and all these other naive wagmi spouting retards who&#039;ve lived their entire lives online and don&#039;t know how the real world works give people like OP&#039;s picture a false sense of hope that if they just lift it will remove all of their problems and they can be the next chad, when in reality, that was never possible. Women won&#039;t respect him because they don&#039;t see him as a male, and men will bully him because he&#039;s a weakling and they will appear more masculine in front of women. There is no looksmaxxing, no ascending, no good social life or passing of genes for this dude. It&#039;s over for him",

I went ahead and tested a 10mg IR just to see the effect. My HR didn&#039;t actually go up compared to last week&#039;s run. Like last week&#039;s run, it slowly started going up around the 2:30 to 3:00 hr mark. Prior to that, it was staying below 140bpm which is still in my Z2. After about 3:20, it shot up into the 150&#039;s which is my Z3, which stayed for the rest of the run, not going past 160bpm.",

As your fitness improves you&#039;ll be running faster and doing more miles. The 5k is mostly aerobic after all, and doing an easy running phase first will prepare you for the harder stuff like threshold runs and race pace intervals (you can test your fitness level with an all-out 5k and then train at that pace with intervals like 5X1000m), some strides too. You absolutely need to do the harder stuff, but you should be cautious with them and run at the correct pace, running too hard risks burning out (I did this mistake myself when I was starting out)<br><br>How much mileage you actually need to go sub 20 depends on a number of factors, like running talent, age, body weight etc.. but my guess is for most people it&#039;s 40k+. Be prepared to train for the long term though. Breaking 20min can take years if you&#039;re starting from zero.",

I suspect it&#039;s the same thing why sometimes we will do longer distances even with a training program. I remember once my planned long run was 8 miles and I ended up doing 14. This was before I was (at the time) half-marathoning only. It was the same way before: just take it as I needed it which I didn&#039;t need for running. It&#039;s easy to see why endurance athletes try to get it prescribed even if they don&#039;t have ADHD.<br><br>You are experimenting with it. That&#039;s okay. If you feel that it is too dangerous, don&#039;t take it. For me, I rarely take it for this reason. I can do the longer distance like last week I did 23miles without them. I don&#039;t like relying on it for working out. It&#039;s not what my doctor prescribed it for, so it feels like abusing it to me. I just did that run as an experiment to see if I could still keep my HR down.",

Probably really depends on whether you&#039;re an occasional user or consistent like me.

I noticed some of those things just go away anyway and even get less painful if you warm up a little. 3 days is kind of just your classic peak muscle ache time tho.

After months, the pain went away, and I was able to start running again. It gets sore sometimes now, but I worked on my form more and it&#039;s mostly fine.

Also, higher cadence with shorter steps. If I feel my legs/knees getting tight, then I end up getting forward movement from my hips and not my quads, and that&#039;s when it starts to hurt.",

That exercise is incline ring pushups. Rings are cheap as fuck. You just control the difficulty by lengthening or retracting the straps to be the right degree of incline for the difficulty.

This trend is mirrored in the West, butt for longer. Historically, Chinese cooking has historically relied on breeds of animals that weren&#039;t bred to grow fast and be slaughtered young.<br><br>A lot of Chinese cooking relies on sauces, usually ones that have lower caloric densities than condiments in the West. Drinking tea instead of soda. On that note, Europeans often drank beer to not get waterborne illness. Tea is from boiled water, obviously. The tea that Europeans and Americans drink is often supplemented with sugar, sometimes a lot, and milk. If you have a cup of Chinese tea, you&#039;ll never look at teabag tea the same way. This tea culture circumvents the societal and survival pressure to drink alcoholic beverages. Not that people in China don&#039;t drink, though.<br><br>Lastly, it depends what part of China we&#039;re talking about. Food in China has always been associated with traditional medicine and balance, leading people to eat relatively balanced diets. When I make hongshao rou, it does include a fatty cut of pork and a little bit of rock sugar. But it relies on sauces that you reduce or simple stocks without anything added but herbs/spices. A lot of the sauces and stocks you find in American food, and some European cuisines, rely heavily on cream and cheese, both calorie dense. Again, not discouraging consumption of dairy, either.",
