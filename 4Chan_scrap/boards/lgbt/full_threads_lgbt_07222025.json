As everything is ephemeral.<br><br>I was born 29th of july, 2002 at 2 am in Stockholm. In the western zodiac I am a leo sun, pisces moon and cancer rising. In the eastern I am a water horse. My myers briggs is INTP-A, my enneagram is 4w5. My temperament is melancholic. Though I also am both partially choleric and sanguine, I am not at all phlegmatic.<br><br>I am diagnosed with autism and ADHD, and I was diagnosed with childhood epilepsy. I heavily suspect that I have a mood disorder but this is undiagnosed.<br><br>Religiously I am a pagan. An animist or a panpsychist. I believe that consciousness is only bound by time and space in a shallow sense and that we can interact with the past or even the future through ritual or through mystical experiences. The same goes for places spatially far apart. I do not believe in secularism and I want the state to obey and enforce divine law.<br><br>I post this as a meditative practice, to try to maintain my own identity as an extant thing for myself psychologically and partially to express myself as a real creature in the world, which externalizes my identity and makes it real to others aswell. While the self is an illusion as are all categories, it is also very important.",

These women are not in high school, they are all in their mid 20&#039;s and in fields that require a reasonable amount of intelligence. Stuff like this makes me wonder why I am even a tranny because I don&#039;t want to be a woman if that&#039;s what being a woman means. Maybe I&#039;m more a weird 3rd sex thing than women because I can&#039;t stand how most women behave and act and the way that they behave and the trends they follow and their fashion etc., and honestly idk I can&#039;t deal with it. idk if this belongs here but yeah like it really makes me doubt myself whenever I am around &quot;real women&quot; because I am nothing like them and I will never be like them.",

As everything is ephemeral.<br><br>I was born 29th of july, 2002 at 2 am in Stockholm. In the western zodiac I am a leo sun, pisces moon and cancer rising. In the eastern I am a water horse. My myers briggs is INTP-A, my enneagram is 4w5. My temperament is melancholic. Though I also am both partially choleric and sanguine, I am not at all phlegmatic.<br><br>I am diagnosed with autism and ADHD, and I was diagnosed with childhood epilepsy. I heavily suspect that I have a mood disorder but this is undiagnosed.<br><br>Religiously I am a pagan. An animist or a panpsychist. I believe that consciousness is only bound by time and space in a shallow sense and that we can interact with the past or even the future through ritual or through mystical experiences. The same goes for places spatially far apart. I do not believe in secularism and I want the state to obey and enforce divine law.<br><br>I post this as a meditative practice, to try to maintain my own identity as an extant thing for myself psychologically and partially to express myself as a real creature in the world, which externalizes my identity and makes it real to others aswell. While the self is an illusion as are all categories, it is also very important.",

Although sometimes it happens by accident; when someone introduces you to a lifestyle perhaps beyond what you are used to, it may give the one with more some temporary joy to be able to provide for someone and bring them happiness, but when things sour, they dont mean to hold that elevation in standards hostage, the proverbial &quot;lifestyle to which theyve become accustomed&quot; but its going to feel that way anyways.<br><br>Likewise, younger more shrewd guys can exploit the guarded naivete, hope and idealism some older men keep to feel included in the romance game a bit longer than is natural. Some younger guys will resort to outright theft or intimidation. It happens a lot, so be mindful that predators arent in just one age group.",

Modesty is a consideration in conflict with self interest, self image and ego.<br><br>I think thats where trans starts. To find males attractive is natural and more appropriately a phase or temptation; the identity is a different more abstract matter. With gays, its a bit more outward directed, trying to reconcile a rather compulsive or persistent desire, reinforced with confusing social messages, with how to manifest in a society thats always going to be a bit conflicted on where to draw the line on recreational sex, and so the discussion is eternal.<br><br>This itself keeps the issue burning in their mind waiting for some final resolution or accepting a constant challenge. But the fascination is outward, an unresolved fascination with peer males (or idealized tropes of them).<br><br>With trans, it spirals inwards instead. Rather than a fascination simply with other males, the zeal for trying to make that reconciliation proposes the idea that one can rebuild from within, and that will resolve the conflict. It goes from despair and/or anxiety to a really sad hope to a plan and ambition to absolute faith.<br><br>With many, the original goal of trying to resolve the conflict becomes abandoned altogether and instead of becoming &quot;a woman&quot; they then pivot to the identity of &quot;trans&quot;, having found some new comfort as part of a more celebrated group than simply women.<br><br>But it begins with looking inward and having doubt. And I think its awful that the mental health profession has gone full evil and in its commercial pursuits, encourages this sort of self defeating value structure.<br><br>It can be tempered and managed, and sometimes even reversed.

They mostly don&#039;t believe in lgbt and are opposed to it. Rights for sexual minorities have only become a much more ingrained thing in western society and culture.

I can&#039;t help myself so I ate out her ass while massaging her abs and balls. <br><br>With her a mess, I went and got her new plug. It went in easy. Too easy. So I made her wait for it. I should have made her beg for it, but the sight was distracting. Continued massaging her, avoiding directly touching her dick. She&#039;s such a brat. I ended the session by working her up with the plug, then slapping her ass until she was leaking. <br><br>I made her thank me for everything I did, keeping note of what stuck in her mind and off she went to work. I might just cuddle her and jerk her off from behind when she&#039;s done. I love her so much.",

I love her so much. When someone shares their insecurities like that, don&#039;t jump to being defensive. It means they care about you so much they&#039;re torn up by the thought of you rejecting them. Not always, but certainly in this case. Jumping to self defense with your partner is a mistake.

There are some people who will react the way you are describing, but many won&#039;t. <br><br>I&#039;m cis les. I have been with plenty of women who don&#039;t realize they&#039;re &quot;pillow princesses&quot;. As in they are boring fucks.

I really don&#039;t like women who confuse the &quot;female role&quot; in sex with being passive. It&#039;s just being passive! It isn&#039;t inherently feminine. It&#039;s submissive, or even a trauma or stress response sometimes. Not inherently feminine. Annoys me to get a girl in bed only to find out they don&#039;t know themselves and what they want well enough to properly say what they want and their level of experience.",

I didn&#039;t realize that I didn&#039;t trust her. She&#039;s been having a rough time so I&#039;m supposed to be making her life easier. I gotta make her happy. Pain and anxiety sometimes make me lose my cool. <br><br>She offered me a back rub. Had to talk me into it. Like a cornered animal lol. It took me a while to let go. At this point I was at an 8 out of 10 on the pain scale. Where your brain kind of whites out when you continue to ignore the pain. Over 12 hours of muscle cramps gets me there. She spent 20 minutes lightly working things out. Aligning my joints and spine as best she could. After she worked all day. And all I did was lay around the place and stretch. Aaaaaaaa. She really makes me think.",

I\u2019m so so sorry for what happened. I\u2019m sorry I cheated. I\u2019m sorry I broke your heart. I\u2019m sorry I betrayed you. I have no excuse. I wish you to the very best. I\u2019m so broken up about what we nearly had. We were so close. I\u2019m so sorry. I wish you were here to tell me it\u2019s all going to be ok. I still can hear you comforting me. I still lean on you for support even tho you\u2019re gone. I just wish you were here so I could show you I appreciate everything you do. I\u2019m so sorry babe. Sorry for The deepest wounds I have created in our relationship. I\u2019m terribly heart broken for the pain I caused you. You were everything to me. And now it\u2019s over. A beautiful thing ruined. I\u2019m devastated and in tears sobbing as I write this. Please forgive me. I know you wish to see me again some day but I have done nothing but hurt you. I deserve to die alone without ever being loved again. I\u2019m so sorry you met me in such a dark place. Thank you so much for everything and helping me out of my mess. I promise you I\u2019ll keep myself out of trouble and do the right things from now on. You were the right one. You were the one for me. I knew it then and I still know it true now. I\u2019m so sorry I never told you how much you meant to me. I never showed it. I\u2019m so sorry. There were so many things I didn\u2019t know how to talk about. I was scared. I needed to get back into therapy and I didn\u2019t make it in time. I lost you because I wasn\u2019t at my best. But you found me at my worst and loved me anyway and that\u2019s the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. You were perfect for me. I miss you so much babe. I hope I can be with you again. I hope you weren\u2019t serious about me not being able to have children, I hope you understand the pressure I felt from your mother. They way she found out when I first met your family.",

Sci-fi, fantasy, history, fitness, manga, talk about something and I&#039;ll probably have a vague interest in it. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;looking for</span><br>New friends, maybe more?but probably not. People I can meet up with since I just moved up here would be nice, but if you aren&#039;t nearby we can just talk too. VCing occasionally, gaming together, that sorta thing. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not looking for</span><br>I don&#039;t mind many types of people. I&#039;ve never met someone who really grinded my gears. I&#039;m not easily offended at all, so long as you&#039;re of a relatively sound mind.

The bathroom thing was not as successful as they wanted it to be, so they had to move on to &quot;fairness in sports&quot; and minors transitioning, and they still had to lie about those topics, and it&#039;s still at the bottom of most people&#039;s ranking of relevant political issues. That doesn&#039;t matter that much under this current administration, but it makes me much more hopeful over the long long run. Most people are not as bad as this incredibly vocal minority wants them to be.",

So you really have to flood the space with positive examples to drown out the optics blackholes, but the paradox is that the most passing trans people will probably just stealth and live happy lives instead of subjecting themselves to the media spotlight. Ultimately you have to incentivize and support those positive examples and somehow give them a reason to defend the neverpasser Shudra caste.",

And, when I finally do open up, it&#039;s autistic as fuck. I say the wrong things to the wrong people. It&#039;s almost out of laziness, because it would be far smarter to just continue to be quiet. I feel like a reptile, but again I am more easily compared to a child.

In any case, it seems like you should try to do something where you don&#039;t have to interact with as many people as customer service (easier said than done, I know.) But what else can you do if you have no intrinsic motivation to fit in or even perform your job well, and your social ineptness/rage make the extrinsic factors bounce off of you? It doesn&#039;t seem like a sustainable situation.<br><br>I used to feel this way at white collar jobs. Felt frozen around my colleagues and couldn&#039;t play the game of the fake/vapid way they interacted with each other. I actually did fine doing customer service work though as long as the vibes at the workplace weren&#039;t terrible. I felt like people weren&#039;t putting up as much of a front and there were more weirdos, so no one cared how weird you were as long as you did the bare minimum of your job. I could loosen up and even befriend people in that environment.",

I am more masculine than the average pooner to the point even when I did ID as trans, I was excluded from them for being too much of an actual man. <br><br>SO why do I have to be in the body I am in. I love being a woman yet women dont treat me like a woman, neither do men, unless its to talk down to me. Ive always been treated as some third gender. <br>Having all this happen but also not being raised around women much really fucks you up lol Its like having female friends feels like a pipedream. It feels like its something Ill never have. I just want to be with female friends similar to me, I feel like that would fix me. <br><a href=\"#p40442065\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;40442065</a><br><a href=\"#p40442152\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;40442152</a><br>I feel like even if you go on HRT you should rep.

I used to be fine and utterly happy being single. And I know that I\u2019ll not just want anyone or anybody, but someone I actually connect with.",

My knee jerk reaction was that I&#039;ll get that done when I&#039;m older. I had no idea that was an option for people until she brought it up. But after years of repping, I fear that attempting to transition would only lead me to hyperfixate on passing and become even more critical of myself.

I was definitely made aware of my gender early on and had my fair share of limitations imposed on to me. I felt like I wasn&#039;t allowed to be myself because I was born female. My extended family had their fair share of gender disappointment and never got over it. I was treated as though being born female was somehow a moral shortcoming. My parents initially thought they were having a boy because their first ultrasound weren&#039;t correct. When my parents later learned that they were having a girl, they opted to keep it a secret and wanted it to be a cute surprise. They weren&#039;t anticipating that much of my family would end up rejecting me because of that. Consequently, I was often treated as defective by my extended family and reminded that I was &quot;supposed&quot; to be a boy.<br><a href=\"#p40459023\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;40459023</a><br>Not MRKH (which is total Mullerian agenesis) but rather a Mullerian anomaly and endometriosis. So It&#039;s similar to MRKH in the sense that portion of development was messed up, but I was still born with a uterus. Just a physically deformed one that served zero utility whatsoever. The bulk of women who try to conceive with what I have end up having late term miscarriages. There are corrective surgeries, however, they can cause internal scarring and not fix the issue. I had no interest in preserving what little fertility that I had, so I opted to yeet that organ in its entirety. It&#039;s been the absolute best thing that I&#039;ve done for myself. A definite weight off my shoulders and it helped me cope with dysphoria over the years.",

Also always hated anything frilly or too weigthed or anything that clung to my body and made me feel like my flesh is trapped in something tight, female clothes are a nightmare for autists</span><br>On this note, I hate how style choices are so readily gendered. I find it dreadful how people are expected to render themselves into caricatures and sacrifice comfort to make others feel at ease. In hindsight, I think being made to present in a hyperfeminine manner primed me for dysphoria. Puberty only made that more difficult. I was told by women that my developing body was abhorrent and that I had to &quot;embrace&quot; modesty. Or else I&#039;d be seen as an object unworthy of basic respect. Just how exactly is hating one&#039;s body extolling the virtues of being a woman? Why is being an object the &quot;default&quot; state of our character and something we have to outrun? It doesn&#039;t make sense.<br>I feel like the end goal of the women&#039;s beauty industry and trans medicine are largely the same. It comes down to profiting off of deep insecurities that were instilled into people as a result of societal expectations. If someone grows up being told that they&#039;re defective (ie not &quot;feminine&quot; or &quot;masculine&quot; enough), you&#039;ve got a lifelong customer. Extreme sex differentiation is the end goal for troons and cissoids alike. And society primes people for that, even though those extremes don&#039;t mesh with reality. <br>Readily accepting those extremes and trying to put oneself in a box seems like NPC behavior. I think that&#039;s largely why I object to transitioning and opt to repress instead. Trying to navigate life as a woman while also asserting my autonomy is difficult, but I don&#039;t want to be a product either.<br><a href=\"#p40459287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;40459287</a><br>If you&#039;re a cisfem or femrepper that&#039;s cool.

Formed, as they are, as it seems, willingly.<br>Trannies are just autists that did what they could with their brains to achieve a sense of self, but weren&#039;t fully successful.<br>I wouldn&#039;t blame a 6 years old autistic kid for not being able to have the mental capacity to achieve through a conscious process the correct structure that his neurotypical peers achieved innately.<br>But thinking that this kid is a woman because of a couple thousands poorly connected neurons is a stretch.<br>Everything else is mostly well connected.<br>Just look at their interests. Just look at this board. You need to be extremely lucky with how you fail with your brain connectivity to be actually somewhat similar (on a phenotypical level, psychologically speaking) to a woman. Usually they get some weird fascination (hoi4, diapers, eroguro), which, to the surprise of absolutely nobody, comes from the fact that their brains are male.<br>I mean, you could change your brain structure in a specific way, but then you can see that you are demasculizing it, and (or) then feminizing it (shoutout to gloves for doing the opposite of this, to a certain extent). But your reptillian brain (with a big chung of the limbic system) is still that with which you developed till 20.",

It&#039;s like asking what a human is, you can get a taxonomy of homo sapiens repeated back to you but most people don&#039;t find that answer very compelling if they&#039;re asking the question in the first place. Similarly, I don&#039;t think people can conceptualize of what a man or woman is purely in the realm of chromosomes and biology, while we can store those facts as knowledge in our brain they remain mere abstractions to our psychology <br>I think of it as we humans are social and behavioral creatures, and we are judged on social and behavioral axes. The boundaries and lines we define men and women on by these axes are varied and at times, blurred when they brush up against each other. As transgender people, we often live in that blurred middle of the two realms, though some do land firmly on one side of the line or the other.",

People love structure when they&#039;re confused. They want to be told how to understand their thoughts. It&#039;s easy to overcomplicate things, then run to the structure for comfort. <br><br>Men and women have a spectrum of instincts and behaviors. These are prompted by hormones. We can experience this by changing our hormones. We also have layers of social understanding with an annoyingly harsh false dichotomy of man/woman that attracts people who are more interested in categorizing things than how well their categories represent truth. This is socialization. Some of us are drawn to focusing on differences. How does a man&#039;s sexuality differ from a woman&#039;s? That question prompts you to think of men and women behaviors as distinctly separate categories. Which isn&#039;t a good representation of real human behavior. <br><br>Look at the people who try their hardest to fit into what they were raised to think their social roll is. They become competitive over displaying their gender at a young age. They call you a fag and socially reject you for natural behaviors. Little dominance games and rituals. This gets confused for sexuality all the time. <br><br>The categories are just one guys autistic attempts to understand gender. It can be helpful, but never take his shit as fact. It&#039;s built on a mountain of bullshit, so the foundation of it isn&#039;t even stable. Don&#039;t rely on it.",

Its all stuff i force myself through tho cause dressing like this is nice, i love fashion, i have mixing cheap hot topic shit with designer pieces with thrifted stuff etc etc and getting looks like these. I love wearing stuff that represents my interests and personality just as much as it is a part of playing the game of being a tranny and expressing gender.

Not one journalist saw fit to report on this fact until after Keir Starmer was elected, and even then, not in a newspaper article - in a book bragging about it.<br><br>UK politics is as fake and stage managed as Russian politics. Boris Johnson was used as a cudgel to get rid of Corbyn, then got too big for his boots and was kicked out for going to a party during Covid. His party elected Liz Truss, but she was right wing in a stupid way and scared the bond markets, so she was quickly replaced. Her replacement was Rishi Sunak, who was at the same party as Johnson, but for some reason that was no longer disqualifying. As a punishment beating for this succession of screwups, the press kept very quiet about Labour having basically nothing good to offer the public during the 2024 election, focusing instead on mocking the Conservatives (who, frankly, were little worse than they usually are.) and hyping up Reform UK.<br><br>The result? A massive Labour victory with fewer votes than they got in 2019, when they lost badly. Voters were unenthusiastic even though all the press gave them was good news for Labour and bad news for everyone else. There&#039;s no central conspiracy, everyone just understands, intuitively, what to say and what not to say if you want to keep your job. Our foreign secretary, in the election campaign, got away with explaining his uncritical support for Israel thus: &quot;Because I want to be Foreign Secretary&quot;, a line that would end your political career in any other country - not for its cynicism, but for its stupidity, for saying the quiet part loud.",

Non-binary is valid only in the social contruct between at least two individuals of minimum intellect in a safe high trust society. You first have to communicate with someone you are non-binary and then tell them your preferred pronouns and then ask they respect this identity. It has almost nothing to do whatsoever with being trans/having gender dysphoria and entirely to do with fashion.",

It&#039;s actually incredible. Most of you are too stupid and not turboautistic enough to realize this, but while intersectionality has not only become the theory of everything in elite liberal society but also affected how people speak and write across the corporate world and academia, people have, ironically enough, become increasingly unable to see things as multicausal. For the most part, this is because people want to feel like they understand things. You can articulate what&#039;s wrong with your philtrum. You can&#039;t articulate how your philtrum, brow, midface, etc. work together, not as entirely separately but how they&#039;re perceived as a unified whole, to make you look more or less feminine. Add in some tranny neurosis to give you the false hope that if you&#039;d only shorten this or lengthen that, you&#039;d pass, and you&#039;re &quot;cooked&quot; as they say. It&#039;s incredible how much more intelligent I am than you.",

The best advice I can think of for you is to keep several people close to you, not necessarily in a sexual way, but one of genuine connection. Having emotional intimacy covered makes you less starved of it, which makes you attach less easily.",

Teaching yourself that healthy food is boring makes you want junk food more. <br><br>I\u2019ve heard that junk food is increasingly being viewed as addictive by experts. It\u2019s packed with things we naturally crave because they\u2019re scarce in nature like fat and sugar, and have a place in a healthy, balanced diet. <br><br>To make sure every meal you eat is as satisfying as possible, make sure it has a source of protein (like meat, tofu, chickpeas), carbs (potatoes, rice, pasta) and fat (like dairy or avocado). <br><br>Are you exercising? Do you know how much activity you\u2019re getting every day? Dieting is important to weight loss, but so is a healthy amount of physical activity (which can feel like a lot because it\u2019s normal to move around less than we should each day). Exercise can also build muscle that helps your body burn more calories \u2014 At least I think that\u2019s how it goes. <br><br>I knew getting in shape would take time, and that made me want to give up instead of start. I\u2019ve been actively working on losing weight for a year as of August, and I\u2019ve still got a ways to go, but the journey has felt wonderful. Going down sizes in clothing, people in my life being impressed by my progress and dedication have all felt great. Not to mention that exercise has short term benefits like improving your mood and blood circulation. The process itself is rewarding.",

Do daily exercises, even just in the bathroom before you shower so you can&#039;t excuse yourself from doing it. Get some sun. <br>For dieting it is important to make incremental changes. Just eat a little less, eat a little cleaner. Don&#039;t try to do it all at once or you&#039;ll burn out. It makes recovering from binging easier too. <br>More specific advice depends on what your eating habits are like. Some things that worked for me are drinking a lot of soda water, keeping snack food around like nuts or especially popcorn that are less calorie dense and more importantly less moreish than other junk. Slowly downsizing my portions, avoiding binges, eating healthy stuff before junkfood to cut down on how much I&#039;d consume. <br>A big help for me too was working out which changed a lot of my food cravings and increased my daily calorie needs but I&#039;m assuming you&#039;re some sort of bottom so that won&#039;t help you.",

For your driving license it strongly depends on your country, but usually there ought to be a service helpline tied to whatever agency is in charge of issuing them.

Would you say the issue is you get overwhelmed and don&#039;t know where to start? In that case compartmentalizing will help. For example, does your floor need tidying up? If so, I would like you to try and pick a square area of floor, for now. A manageable amount, maybe 30x30cm, or a ft^2. Set a fixed time and day and set yourself an alarm to tidy it up (remove trash, put things away). It will probably take much less than an hour. Look around your room, you will find that the total area is only a small multiple of that, right?

Think of it as us trying to debug your vibes if you will. A great deal about human connection boils down to fostering and expressing mutual appreciation.

If you recall, part of my crash was that I hadn&#039;t read any of your messages for weeks and then blocked you.

I was actually kinda disappointed to see them disappear from the space I like to hang around when I showed back up cuz they&#039;re a spectacular writer and probably the best contributor to our mutual interest. Lo and behold, here they are in /sig/.<br>I&#039;ll try to stick around an answer any questions. This is a neutral space where I dont have friends or supporters to jump down their throat. My anxiety doesnt fly off the handle nearly as hard in public settings so maybe this will work? I dunno.",

Every single time I tried to reach out to you and be kind, you rejected me. Every time I tried to get along, you ignored me. I don&#039;t understand it as anything but malice. As far as I&#039;m concerned this is more bullying. I&#039;ve done nothing wrong and you still chose to hurt me. My psychologist calls you an abuser btw.<br>5. &quot;Oops sorry lol&quot; doesn&#039;t cut it. You punch me in the face and laugh out an &quot;apology&quot; as you leave me bleeding all alone, and expect anything but hate? That doesn&#039;t come close to torturing me for a year so you and your friends can feel superior. But of course nobody will take the side of the autistic freak, they&#039;re rather I kill myself than you.",

That wasnt the time of place to be answering interpersonal drama questions.<br>Im not acting like my apology rectifies things, not even close. Nor do I expect you to ever, EVER forgive me. My decision was not an actual of intentional cruelty, but one of self preservation. I could mentally take walking on eggshells around you all the time - every little word dissected until it looked like some flayed facsimile that didnt even remotely resemble the intent. You practically demanded constant apologies and concessions just for me to have a chance to try to talk, and made it clear that the only way you&#039;d give me credence were if our positions were reversed. I felt like I was being gaslit nonstop into feeling like a worse person than I am.<br><br>Why does me ignoring or blocking you wound you so severely? Even before this last incident, I put you on filter and didnt say a word to you for months before you melted down. Is it really that bad for us to acknowledge that our presence and dynamic is toxic and just coexist silently? Why cant we just enjoy our mutual interest separately without having to constantly turn shit into a character drama?<br>I mean, hell, this last time you took your trip off (bypassing the filter you knew I probably put back up) just to signal how bad me just talking about the topic without interacting with you made you feel and that you were leaving. Instead of just quietly leaving, you made an attempt to stab at me using my love for that gen and worries that it will collapse if the community shrinks much more as a weapon. And Im the abuser here? All ive fuckin wanted, this whole fuckin time, is for everyone to get along without arguing about stupid shit.

Okay so there are different things to this: are we talking about you always being the one to initiate conversation, or outright drive it? Do people you engage with rarely share things on their own if prompted? One big issue is when people basically never really expand upon anything.

Going up just a little from your natural range and practicing that until it\u2019s very easy for you and then going a little higher each time until you can do the higher voice consistently. I know how it feels to want to stay in the range that\u2019ll give you the least dysphoria though.",

Essentially Ive been a spineless people pleaser my whole life, the avg neglected middle child, etc ,etc. I definitely pushed romantic feelings onto a friend that didn&#039;t want those romantic feelings, Ive taken accountability for that. We are from the same friend group and for a long period of time for about 3 years for lack of a better word felt like I had him all to myself but whenever I see his profile picture It triggers me like I dont understand like my chest gets tight and it flares up. When I see his profile picture on discord is online and he hasnt sent me a message I get triggered, when I see his steam profile picture I get triggered, it literally feels horrible. I don&#039;t talk to him because I was just obsessed with his attention. Ive had an actual relationship sense then with a guy I really liked that wasn&#039;t him but he had to move back home because he was studying abroad. Now my brain is in fight or flight mode trying to get another meaningful connection and I think about messaging him and stop myself because I just want his attention and he does not want me. We spent alot of time with each other and I just cannot get over the pain I went through knowing it meant nothing to him. I am relapsing so bad, even right now I think I just want validation. I know this wont last forever there will be a day when I dont think about him at all but looking for a job right now has my self worth feeling the absolute lowest its ever been. I cant give up though I dont know why living while giving up somehow feels worse than all of this. I genuinely feel like Im losing my mind.",

People worshiped, obviously, but there was a coexisting belief that properly enacting certain formulae would allow someone to &quot;compel&quot; divine action on some specific problem. This stems from the understanding that divinity is both something with an ego/identity AND a ubiquitous natural force that follows predictable laws. <br>Consider a river- you as an individual can&#039;t redirect it, but you could build a waterwheel and harness its power to run your mill and achieve things beyond your sole capacity in that way.

Tall and lean and predominantly hairless, and probably the best looking option here (bar demon). He will lovingly turn you into a vampire, which completely changes you into a pale idealized form (you won\u2019t look recognizable), if undead, but it\u2019s a painful process (he has to drain you to the point of death, give you some of his blood, letting it take over yours - and it feels like an ice cold dagger being plunged into the heart as it stops beating forever). He loves you obsessively but is a soft psychopath and doesn\u2019t care if his love bites hurt. <br><br>b) <br>Werewolf. Towering, buff, and hairy as fuck. Masculine all over, with handsome sharp features thrown in. Reeks of musk. Can turn into a werewolf at will turn feral during a full moon. Can offer to turn you into a werewolf but this requires you to be violently bitten or scratched by him during a full moon. Werewolves \u201chunt\u201d for their mates during a full moon, not to kill but to knot and \u201cmark\u201d. Sometimes fatally, woe to the werewolf. Most \u201chuman\u201d option, but also the horniest. <br><br>c) <br>Ghost. A handsome gentleman living in an enormous hotel or some other manse like place. He died during the 20s and is unable to leave the foundations of the place. He can only be physically touched on hallow\u2019s eve. Otherwise you have to kill yourself within the foundations to trap your soul there with him for all eternity. This gives you access to an underworld realm like in Beetlejuice. <br><br>d) <br>Demon. An intimidating and truly evil (surpassing even the vampire) monster from hell. Takes on the appearance of what you\u2019d be most attracted to, which can be unbearably tempting. Eats the flesh of kids and cats. Wants to corrupt your soul so you can be with him forever. His true form is too terrible to describe, but you might enjoy it in time. He offers powerful sorcery, should you give in.<br><br>All have 9/10 appearances at the very least.",

After her last breakdown I begged her to go to the mental hospital after she threatened to kill herself. When she got out after a week (she called me exactly twice while in there) she jokingly mentioned half the reason why she agreed to go in was to get &quot;a little vacation from work&quot; (she quit). That Monday before I went into work I made it absolutely clear that we were in a dire financial situation and that she needed to work on getting a new job while I was grinding at work in order for us to survive. When I got home, she simply told me that she hadn&#039;t done it because &quot;I was just so tired from being at the hosptial...it&#039;s not a vacation spot you know&quot;. That was the final straw for me. It evidenced to me clearly that she was not taking this seriously, didn&#039;t care about our future, and was unlikely to change in any real capacity. So I ended it that night.<br><br>This is of course on top of lying, cheating, and any number of other minor offenses. But that&#039;s sort of small potatoes when it comes to potentially ruining someone&#039;s financial future forever.",

In my opinion, this is just the beginning, and will get much much worse over time with no hope of recovery because he is such a liar. He lied his way out of the hospital, lied his way out of a welfare check, lies to his therapist, lied to me. Fucking subhuman piece of shit. I am so sick of having mentally ill partners<br>I had a bipolar BPDemon bf too that came out as trans when he moved in with me.

If you&#039;re the first to get to the top of a tower you can create a choke point, and multiply your power by gravity. <br><br>Due to my innate combat abilities, id easily win against 12 people because after pushing the guy down the stairs, i then remove his rib and fashion a nice dagger out of this. A dagger is all you really need in this type of engagements. <br><br>Now the big factor is, just what kind of weapons are stashed around the corner? <br>Guns? Swords? It makes stuff really hard to decide.<br><br>Because if swords, ur best bet is humans.<br><br>But if lets say a sniper rifle or a 50cal armor penetrating magum revolver is laying around somewhere, then bears are the better choice because you&#039;d only need one bullet per bear to make them non issues. <br><br>So it depends on the weapons.

It doesnt matter what you didnt choose if what you do choose is to renew the decision daily to abandon any effort to make sex your top priority. You claim some aversion to starting a relationship under false pretenses while gay monogamy remains an even bigger joke than gay marriage.<br><br>You could have your sexual outlet in private but you dont. You want visibility, code for encouraging others. And if kids see it, then so be it. Gays will unironically tell you how awful it is for gays and then tell kids to explore feelings while simultaneously telling adults that gays have no choice.<br><br>And for every gay that insists they were &quot;born&quot; some way and &quot;knew&quot; as kids they were gay, I have yet to hear one child ever that has ever claimed to want to be sodomized, and if there is one, I would say thats a pretty big red flag.<br><br>Seems awful strange that all gays are &quot;born&quot; that way and yet so few realize it until they are away from parents and high school peers to have the freedom to find &quot;love&quot; over and over and over and over on some app.",

To claim such is being absurdly generous to the character of these &quot;heterosexual&quot; men and is why they go along with it. It claims they are genetically incapable of such immorality. Because what would their morality be if we only went by evidence?<br><br>It would be cheating, whoring, jacking off, rape and fucking minors, animals and basically anything that cant run away fast enough.<br><br>But never males. Right? Please.<br><br>No, homosexuality is just an extension of that same priority of getting off and its not flattering.<br><br>Do some guys fail at women, or access to them, of course. Do you have to be &quot;gay&quot; to find women repulsive at every level for compassion, conversation, cooperation, reason or company. Obviously not.<br><br>And is it realistic to insist that anyone make children if given a choice? No, no its not. Because its harder to define what the choice really is given current culture and economics.<br><br>And by extension, is it reasonable to ask men to bear these women on the womens terms? Absolutely not, because the terms have become a disaster.<br><br>But is that a reason to withdraw into a lifelong cope and then go on to encourage others to do the same as some pseudo moral cause?<br><br>I am not telling you that it is unnatural to find males attractive or that you shouldnt live your life however you damn well please. And if you feel you have to be loud and proud about it, where ever you are in the world or life, then make your choice to do it and let the chips fall where they may and live with your decision.<br><br>But please, dont tell me its not political when gays have defined themselves for the last 50 years as a litigious political lobby for those who have made one sexual interest their top priority, demand respect for it and encourage our youngest to do it also.",

A good relationship ain\u2019t about how hot the other person is or how fun and exciting they are, but rather how happy you are with them. Its not just looks, it\u2019s personality, and habits and just small small things here and there that add up. And that\u2019s what\u2019s most important to me as well. Looks will fade, bodies will change but the personality will remain the same. What I\u2019m trying to say is I try to be a reasonable, sensible person. <br><br>With that being said, I don\u2019t know why, but I\u2019ve been having these thoughts lately. It\u2019s different from the typical horny thoughts I\u2019d have. Just jerking off would make that go away. But this doesn\u2019t. I have this deep, deep desire to be with a person that looks like picrel. I\u2019ve always been someone who\u2019s had the answer to any question, and if I didn\u2019t know it I could always find the answer. But I don\u2019t know why, it\u2019s just something that my brain wants. I\u2019m not a gooner or some fat indoor lazy bum. I\u2019m probably a normie by some peoples standards on here; I spend time outside, I have a bunch of good friends, I have hobbies, I work out. Etc. I\u2019m normal in every way. But for some reason I just can\u2019t shake this thought. I want someone like that to be by my side. I want to see them laugh, I want to cuddle with them. I want to enjoy doing things with them. <br><br>I just wonder to myself: why? I can do all of these things with a girl. So why do I have these types of thoughts for a person like this? I don\u2019t really know, hence why I make this post.",

Redditors are weird. They&#039;re stupid. Libs will view you as dangerously radicalized. It&#039;s easy to draw a straight line between /tttt/and it&#039;s primary influences: far right communities (racism, antisemitism, sexism) and the manosphere (hatred for AFABs and lesbians, slang like mogging and maxxing). These aren&#039;t just the current cultural boogeyman of the normie lib. They&#039;re entirely identified with men, moreso than they&#039;re identified with whites even. There&#039;s a black manosphere, there&#039;s Hispanics on the far right. The only unifying factor here for libs is maleness. It&#039;s worth noting again that these are viewed as dangerous firms of radicalization. Libs hate all sorts of radicals, like the far left and anti-zionists, but they view these as stupid radicals rather than people who pose any threat of violence. When they discover /tttt/the gender illusion will dissolve completely. It hasn&#039;t happened yet because only troons and chuds come here. You&#039;ll get outed eventually.",

He always speaks about his &quot;best friend&quot; which whom he spends a lot of time playing and laughing at his silly jokes. When he says that kind of things I can see the stars in his eyes like if he admires him, but probably not in a platonic way. He&#039;s growing his hair and wear a scarf, which I really find ugly because it doesn&#039;t really suit the rest of his outfit (he usually wears white shirts with black pants). But I wouldn&#039;t say he gives tranny that tries to boymod neither, nor that he&#039;s a regular cis gay male. So I&#039;m pretty convinced that he&#039;s a femboy. How do I make him talk to me about it so I can shame him as the tranny alpha I have to be ? I like him we talk a lot about a lot of things but I need to let him know that I know, but I can&#039;t know if I&#039;m not sure, so he has to come out to me",

It&#039;s usually that they&#039;re either 1) chuds who couldn&#039;t carry on repping, but equally hate minorities too much to be welcome elsewhere on the political spectrum, 2) they have far right friends, probable religious trauma, and don&#039;t really believe in anything politically, but LARP as right wing anyway because that&#039;s all they&#039;ve ever known, or 3) true believer tradcons who confuse passing with being accepted, and believe they can be a good enough tranny to singlehandedly wrangle conservative opinion on trannies forward to around where gays are currently.<br><br>Most of them will have to reckon with the truth sooner or later, which is that they could take a bullet for one of the people they surround themselves with, and odds are the last words they&#039;d hear before they slip into the light would be a 41% joke.",

But in reality there are procedures in place to try and discern whether children are in fact trans or not. These aren\u2019t over-the-counter hormones we\u2019re talking about. The kids talk to a mental health professional to try and figure out what\u2019s going on. Parents are generally not in a huge rush during this process. You have a sensational view of things. And it\u2019s outrageously transphobic to be talking about the gender identity concerns of kids as if they were just a sexual spectacle for adults. It\u2019s amazing that, as a trans person, you have so little sympathy for other trans people. You must have such disgust when you see people who aren\u2019t ashamed like you are. It\u2019s because you\u2019ve deeply internalized that shame, and I feel bad for you. You are completely marginalized in the political party you have such an affinity for, and yet you think it\u2019s all you deserve. I assume you think slavery was no big deal too and that Martin Luther King was a communist agitator.",

Growing up, you get sex pushed in your face constantly by your peers and society because that&#039;s just the way things are, but it grossed me the fuck out. Just imagine all of society having a scat fetish. (it&#039;s the grossest thing I can personally think of, if you have a scat fetish just think of something else) <br><br>People talk about imagining their crush defecating themselves, how the smell of shit gets them turned on, stories have a mandatory scene where the protagonist eats the fecal matter out of some hot babe, every ad has a model smeared in shit to entice the viewers, etc. <br><br>Really this is how every discussion around sex felt to me, and after a while I began to detest sex in its entirety. I started focussing exclusively on the negatives to justify my revulsion to it. Porn corrupting people&#039;s brains from a very young age, sex trafficking, rape statistics, paraphilias, pedophelia, you name it. They were all tied to sex, and because of it sex was something horrid by association, something primal and animalistic carried over from our ape-ish ancestors.<br><br>And then one day I had an epiphany and stopped being retarded. There is nothing wrong with having sex. People have sex because they like it and need it, and they were born that way, and that&#039;s it. There is no greater evil or something inherently disgusting, that&#039;s just the way I felt about it. Just because someone jerks off does not mean they want to rape every woman in vicinity or they want to diddle their kids; that&#039;s just insane cope I made up because of my own irrational beliefs. <br><br>I feel like this is the same way people view homosexuality, and more recently, trans people. Something in their brain goes crazy when they think of a guy taking it up the ass or a girl with a dick, and to justify their feelings they delude themselves with cherry picked theories or stories so they can moralfag about mental illness or god and not feel insane.",
