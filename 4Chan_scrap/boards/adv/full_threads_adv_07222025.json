The opening scene from Saving Private Ryan is one of the few movie scenes that make me feel physically sick, because I see all these young men, no different from you or me, sent into a meat-grinder, into a war that is really not their battle to fight, simply because they are considered expendable. Their dreams, their memories, their talents, all irrelevant. They were expendable.<br><br>Women are wonderful, but as far as sheer achievement goes, as a gender they are pretty mediocre overall. Yet it doesn&#039;t matter. You can be the most excellent man, a man that towers above the rest as far as talent and achievement goes. You can be a Mozart, a Tesla, a Newton, a Shakespeare, and yet when the boats starts sinking, all that is irrelevant. Women and children first.

I question if living with just her is agony or if I\u2019m not meant for relationships in general. I don\u2019t cheat, I am communicative and understanding and we get through most of our problems smoothly it\u2019s just that there\u2019s a lot of fucking problems and they\u2019re all petty, unnecessary things. She\u2019s one of those hippy \u201ccool girls\u201d but with that comes the sensitivity and this overwhelming neediness.. maybe it wouldn\u2019t be such a problem if we weren\u2019t stuck at the hip every fucking day. She also needs to get a fucking job, she\u2019s been living with me for almost a year now and is still jobless while I work my ass off. <br>This morning she said she was awake and was talking to me, so I continued to talk to her and tell her about some issues going on with my mom being sick and she replies WHY DID YOU WAKE ME UP? and I reply \u201coh I thought you were awake you just said so\u201d and she was apparently sleep talking, and yells again \u201cIT WAS A SIMPLE QUESTION WHY DID YOU WAKE ME UP\u201d<br>I didn\u2019t say it but I wanted to say bitch!! It\u2019s fucking 12 in the afternoon! You should be up by now man and why the hell are you yelling at me for just trying to fucking talk to you? But I\u2019m not one to escalate things so I just tried to explain to her again why I thought it would have been okay to speak to her in that moment and I didn\u2019t mean to wake her up. Little things like this. Every. Fucking. Day. It\u2019s driving me mad. The apologies will come and things will be \u201cfixed\u201d but honestly this kind of little petty shit is just driving me up a wall and I think I just need space but I\u2019m worried about our future together in general at the moment",

Isekai is a genre of Japanese media where a character, typically a human from this world, travels or reincarnates in another world, typically a medieval swords-and-magic one.<br>A common trope of Isekai is the MC using his knowledge of the advanced technological civilization he comes from to improve his life and the world he now inhabits. Sometimes the protagonists even become kings and build their very own civilizations.<br>I like this genre and thus I daydream about it. I have wondered, what steps would I have to take to build my own civilization? How can I protect my civilization from getting destroyed? And conversely, how can I destroy the civilizations of my enemies?<br>That is why I cannot see all this LGBTQKJSDFASD bullshit as nothing more but crass attempts at civilizational destruction.<br>Sow discord, harm communal identity, poison the food and water supply, then tell the isolated hormonally-imbalanced youngsters to chop off their genitals, turn homosexual, accept a trillion foreigners--eunuchs and homos can&#039;t maintain civilization.<br>In my Kingdom, LGBTQAJSKFD would be forbidden on penalty of execution, and my spies would promote it nonstop in my enemies&#039; territories.

Most people don&#039;t want to hang out with their parents as friends because they can&#039;t be themselves, but it&#039;s good if you can. I know personally, my parents just harass me about what I should do with my life, what my plans are, pressure me into doing what they want, guilt trip me about what I haven&#039;t achieved yet, or mistakes I&#039;ve made, etc. It is impossible for me to hang out with them as friends, we don&#039;t have that type of relationship, it is very much a parent-child relationship.<br><br>Also, most parents cockblock. Hanging out with your parents is very different than having a group of friends your own age. You can&#039;t talk to qts or go to parties or talk about sexual things etc. if your parents are there. They also don&#039;t understand your generation&#039;s slang/memes and it would be cringe if they did. So overall, most people&#039;s parents are just suppressing and lame. Your friend&#039;s most likely are, so it&#039;s hard for him to understand why you like hanging out with yours.",

But what matters is not whether the vaccine has risks, it is whether taking it increases or decreases the total risks you are exposed to. And that it is a much complex calculation: while the vaccine certainly can cause ischaemic strokes, etc. catching COVID-19 when you&#039;re *not* vaccinated can ALSO cause ischaemic strokes. So, having the vaccine might give you a stroke; but vnot having the vaccine and catching COVID might also give you a stroke. What you have to ask is, which of these two scenarios is *more* likely to give you a stroke: having the vaccine or not having it? And the answer is: you are much more likely to have a stroke as a result of not taking the vaccine than you are from taking it.<br><br>Here&#039;s just one study (of 29 million people) that looked into that: https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj<wbr>.n1931 . They concluded that, while the Pfizer vaccine could cause strokes, catching COVID while not vaccinated was 12 times more likely to cause a stroke than the vaccine was.",

I can&#039;t have arguments with them as calmly as I&#039;d like. I can&#039;t keep up with their silly jabs/shit tests all the time, preferring to be silent or ignore them when I should react to them in a more positive manner.<br><br>The last girl I was with questioned me a lot in a short period because we met while she was traveling in my country and I was invited by her to visit hers. The problem arises when I told her about my intentions of staying with her longer than 1-2 weeks, maybe a month, maybe more. I understood I was being unreasonable because it had been only 2-4 months since we met, but the way she loved me felt so intense, more than I had ever experienced in my life after 4 long relationships. <br><br>I could see her fall out of love in real time as I failed to answer any of her serious questions, shit tests as the relationship went on, I got too anxious about losing her that I froze, and began agreeing with her about everything. The frame had changed. It went from her seeing me as a really cool smart mystical ladies man to a weak boy. She was so beautiful and it hurts knowing that it was all my fault that I lost her. <br><br>Sure, the modern woman comes with an insane list of expectations in dating, dating itself is hell. but I should know better than to betray myself like that. <br><br><br>How can I work on myself besides working out, eating healthy, making friends, hanging out, reading, working on skills? My sleep is really bad, I don&#039;t know how to fix it, I keep waking up too early, my average time is 4-5 hours. My emotions are really bad, I don&#039;t smile much.

Nice, normal women are generally taken because nobody wants to deal with crazies and uglies. Unless you got lucky, youre hunting for scraps like the rest of us. I got crushed when I found out the cute accounting girl at my company who is the nicest person Ive met in a while has a bf, but it makes sense, youd be dumb to not make a move asap if you met someone like her. Also, apps show you the more popular users to keep you engaged so maybe you just gotta hunt harder.",

It&#039;s an easy mental habit to form because we&#039;re all anonymous and all under the same uniform identity. Most users aren&#039;t here for dialogue or insight or anything.

Companies aren\u2019t going to do the kind of background checks you\u2019re thinking of for the sorts of jobs you are likely applying to.

A few years ago I met a girl who did it to me. <br><br>She was insanely hot (french/japanese hapa) and also super intelligent (working on a doctorate in bio engineering) but also bi-polar and a junkie. I met her after a rave and she told me that her bf had broken up with her a while ago and that she felt bad and was under-fucked. I instantly went for it and had sex with her, afterward she was SUPER flirty and nice with me, she cooked for me, sucked my dick and did everything I wanted her to. I saw some red-flags, but it was so good that I actually thought we&#039;re gonna end up in a relationship.<br><br>BUT then it started coming apart. First, it turned out that she didn&#039;t break up with her bf yet and was still living with him, and basically use me as a scapegoat to break up with him and make him feel bad. At some point we actually went out partying together, because I didn&#039;t know that yet and she told me they were on good terms now, and the guy actually started crying and leaving in the middle of the night. <br><br>THEN it got even worse, because she started to fuck with me really bad. She would constantly tease me with sex and then blueball me and shorty after told me she was fucking a new guy with a giant dick and the fucked her like nobody else before while looking me into the eyes and smiling like an actual psycho. It hurt but I cut it off right then and there. After like 2 weeks she started contacting me again, and told me that the guy was made up and she didn&#039;t know what she was doing etc. but I didn&#039;t fall for it, and it later turned out the guy was real and she was pulling the same shit with him. <br><br>Long story short, some people are awful, don&#039;t let it get to you.",

Let go of the term &#039;cuck&#039; and &#039;cucking&#039;. It&#039;s a degenerate word, used by idiots. It&#039;s a word that shames the one who was betrayed. The shame entirely belongs to the traitor. <br><br>And let go of the idea that the other man stole her. He did not steal her. She chose to cheat you, she chose to fuck him. This wasn&#039;t a choice that even included you. She did not choose him over you, as if you were not good enough. She didn&#039;t even choose him. She chose herself. Because that is what she does, she is selfish and self-consumed. She chose to chase whatever the fuck was in her head. Most likely some fucked shit too, shit that speaks of her issues. This guy just happened to be cut from the same dysfunctional cloth. <br><br>Your only mistake is you chose a girl who was damaged. Few screws loose. Emotionally fucked. You chose her because you were young, inexperienced, you didn&#039;t know the signs or the red flags. You could not see that sort of person headed your way, you were blinded by ideals of love and happiness and you didn&#039;t see her true character before this happened. <br><br>It&#039;s a very painful lesson to learn, its brutal. But it has value. If you properly integrate it and accept it and extrapolate the lessons, you will be much better at spotting these types of girls in the future, you will avoid them long before even needing to date them to figure out they are for the streets. <br><br>This was not your fault.

This however has made many people close to me start cutting me off for being &quot;gay&quot; or &quot;bisexual&quot; which was honestly expected ( I just didn&#039;t think it would be this bad). *check images for context* Im not confused with my sexuality, I just can&#039;t come to terms with it.

Now I&#039;m just overweight, but I still struggle with self-confidence.<br><br>This really affects my life.<br><br>I&#039;m obviously depressed from not living the life of a young adult. You know, going to parties, kissing, hanging out with friends and stuff. But it&#039;s not only that. I can&#039;t afford to look to women in the street because I fear they will find me creepy. So I just avoid them. I&#039;ve been made fun on by girls multiple times. I&#039;ve seen them glare at me, them make fun of me, and much more. The worse part is I know that my anxiety around women is to blame for those bad experiences, but women&#039;s reactions just feedback my anxiety.<br><br>I have only been approached once by a girl and she asked me about what I&#039;m doing in life and stuff like that. She wanted to meet me at a surface level, because we&#039;d been training for a sports competition together for a little while. But that&#039;s pretty much it. Every other person treats me in a belittling way.<br><br>I&#039;m very tired of my life. It seems like I lack not only in my social life, but in my other lives as well. Academics is a big example.<br><br>To illustrate what I said, yesterday I went to dine at a nearby mall and decided to stop by the bookstore. I went to the manga session and there was a girl around my age with her father. I was in the mange section and decided to check out the pages of a manga adaptation of a book I&#039;ve read, Battle Royale. But the girl and her dad were beside me. I thought they were going to move or something, but they stood beside me for a while. Maybe they were waiting for someone or something. I got self-conscious and left the bookstore, lol. Pathetic behavior, I know.<br><br>On my appearance: white, 5&#039;7&quot;, BMI of 27,5 and a slightly good face. I&#039;d rate myself somewhere between 6 and 7 out of ten.

You aren&#039;t telling him HOW or any sort of direction. If you wanted to lose weight and someone told you to stop eating what does that mean literally or figuratively? No shit OP is gonna fight back because you aren&#039;t giving them anything that makes sense and is open to their own thoughts than actual facts.<br><br>Anywho OP here is some non gay answers that hopefully will work.<br><br>It seems like your issue is you don&#039;t have a social circle that goes out and does things. You need to get one, but how do you do that? If you have social media try looking for local groups of your interests and see if they do meet ups or events. Meetup.com is a good one if you hate social media in general. Go to the event and start talking to people, and if you find you are vibing with the group then keep going and you&#039;ll make friends. Eventually they (or maybe you!) Will invite you to stuff outside of the regular met up or other social groups and you&#039;ll start to really bond with them who will then introduce you to women for you to talk too. Or if there are women in the group you may end up connecting with them.<br><br>Yes this isn&#039;t going to be a instant or fast process so do try to calm down but that&#039;s about your only option right now.",

Let go of your desire, free yourself from attachment, and embrace the paradox of the universe that love will find you once you stop looking for it and find complete abundance within yourself. Love yourself unconditionally and set yourself on such a magnificent life path journey that you are filled with contentment. At that point, the truth is that you will become exponentially more attractive to potential partners, and they will be innately drawn to you in order to join you on your journey.<br><br>Although this is very abstract, I genuinely believe it is a better state of mind to be in than one of scarcity and lacking, where you feel like you are missing something, and you will not be complete until you find someone. Women are very odd in that they have a 6th sense, so if they get even the slightest hint of neediness or desperation, their biological instincts will repel them from you.<br><br>You have been trying to meet women in standard \u201chobby\u201d settings, perhaps try casting a wider net by going out and socializing more, trying to meet as many people as people.

Millions of other guys already had the same idea of going there to *socialise* (meet women). The few attractive women who do go to these things usually have an entourage of guys trying to talk to them and most aren&#039;t even interested because they have dozens of better men messaging them on Instagram or Hinge at any given time. I do recommend people go to these things though because it&#039;s a good eye-opener and does at least help you practise talking to strangers.",

If someone has anime posters all over his walls, it doesn&#039;t make anime cringe, it makes him seem obsessed. Likewise, reactionary symbology doesn&#039;t say anything about the ideology but everything about your current philosophy. Nobody likes NatSoc this much, unless it is very pertinent to them. Not even Hitler had flags covering every wall of his office. It&#039;s just not appealing. It&#039;s ugly and obsessive. This is a sign of insecurity, and that gives everyone the ick.<br><br>Don&#039;t change your beliefs, just be a bit more charismatic about it. A small, cool Nazi-object on your desk would suffice. Remove all those flags, those jackets, and just have a cool swastika on your desk. It suffices. Any girl would ask, you could say it&#039;s your fidget spinner or your self defense shuriken in case of a home invasion, make them interested and then download all your shit onto them later.<br><br>Become a man and grow out of the insecurity.

I haven&#039;t spoke to my childhood best friend in almost 5 years. But we both know we are best friends. When we reconnect, we pick up where we left off as if nothing happened. No hard feelings no petty emotions or insecurity, just a solid understanding through and through. <br><br>Men don&#039;t need close bonds because the bonds they do have typically last a lifetime. We make a friend, we then know we dont need to have playdates or constant connection we take confidence that we&#039;ll catch up when we&#039;re 70 years old to share life stories around the hearth and a few beers. <br><br>Whereas women demand close bonds, extremely suffocatingly close. And then it implodes because feelings got too high and they stepped on each other&#039;s feelings over small shit and then all of a sudden Stacy hates Becky because she didn&#039;t consider Stacy&#039;s feelings when deciding to announce her baby shower on the same week she announced her birthday party. (Stacy didn&#039;t actually care, but the fact Becky didn&#039;t ask if she cared was the thing that Stacy is pouting about). <br>So, 5 year friendship goes bye bye as if it didn&#039;t exist to begin with. <br><br>Female bonds are fickle as fuck.

It happens when there&#039;s prolonged sexual arousal without ejaculation, leading to a buildup of blood in the testicles and epididymis (the tube where sperm is stored). This can cause discomfort or pain in the testicles, often described as a heavy or aching sensation, sometimes with a mix of pleasure and pain, as you mentioned. The term &quot;blue balls&quot; comes from the idea that the testicles might take on a bluish tint due to blood congestion, though this isn&#039;t always visible.<br>Your experience\u2014pain and pleasure during masturbation without ejaculating, worsening over days, and relief after ejaculation\u2014aligns with epididymal hypertension. The pain isn&#039;t from &quot;fullness&quot; of semen (semen volume is relatively small and doesn&#039;t cause this), but from increased blood flow and pressure in the testicular area. It&#039;s not muscle cramps either, though the discomfort can feel intense or cramp-like.<br>When you ejaculate, the body releases the built-up blood pressure, which explains why the pain went away. The longer you go with arousal without release, the more intense the sensation can get, as you noticed with it becoming &quot;harder to last.&quot;<br>It&#039;s a benign condition, and ejaculation or even just waiting for arousal to subside can resolve it. If the pain persists or worsens even after ejaculation, it might be worth checking with a doctor to rule out other issues like an infection or testicular injury.",

It&#039;s been over 10 years, we&#039;re both in our 30&#039;s now, and my dating life has been abysmal. Hers hasn&#039;t bee much better. She had one long term boyfriend but he turned out to be an asshole who stole from her and tried to ruin her life. She&#039;s moved in with me because rent is so damned high. She wants to start having sex again but I&#039;m hesitant. It&#039;s been so long and I thought that part of our lives was over. I will admit I do want sex. It&#039;s been over a year for me and the idea of having access to regular pussy is very appealing. I just don&#039;t know how this will affect our relationship. We&#039;re not kids anymore and we&#039;re living together in a precarious financial situation. She&#039;s made it clear that she&#039;s done with dating, maybe for the rest of her life, but I&#039;m not sure I&#039;m ready to give up yet. I know it&#039;s probably hopeless but at 35 if I haven&#039;t found someone, maybe I should just enjoy what I can with my sister and accept reality. What do you think?",

A short nap generally doesn&#039;t let you get down into deep sleep at all. Try 15-20 minutes for that.

Sometimes I wonder if that was the right decision since now I keep on coming back to online porn and feeling paranoid about my browsing history, but then again I was literally adding to that collection pretty much daily for over a decade anyway and it was getting out of hand.

She much more prefers sleep over a hug, and very often get mad when I hug her before going to sleep.<br>We are now a month without a proper cuddle, and 4 months without sex.

Nobody bothers to classify every single scenario and lead it to a solid theory. Maybe in 200 years people will have the guide you need.<br><br>But you should know this. You are esnared and need to position yourself in a way you can start freeing up the knots in that net. I don&#039;t know all the knots, but one of those is Pressure. Stop trying to put pressure about being unhappy. Stop trying to justify your interests. Another knot is Criticism, stop judging people, stop judging hobbies, stop judging yourself.<br><br>This is as far as people go regarding help. The work is not done, only you will be able to see what else is hindering you from then on, the rest of the world loses interest in helping you at this step. As I said the first step is positioning yourself to not entangle yourself more, it&#039;s difficult to do as much and takes time. To some people it helps to become Buddhist, stoics, meditate, become low inhibited hedonists, etc. <br><br>What does someone who is truly free looks like? He speaks his mind, he isn&#039;t bothered by opposing opinions, he stands his ground, He is able to express his way of humoring himself, and people like him flock to his humor. It&#039;s key to know a lot of people grew up the same way so they easily flock together. A person who is different will always have a lonelier life, will feel lonely in one or other way. I guess for people like this, he should have many different friends at the same time who cater to his specific needs, and he should see himself as the coordinator of a bigger group. That&#039;s as much as can be done I guess.",

As a guy I avoided shaving forever because people just talk about the problems they had, and I tried it once as a teen and the itchiness put me off. <br>But I learned during covid lockdowns shaving is easy: Just buy a 20 dollar general purpose electric shave then go to town with it. If doing it wet, sometimes I just use hair conditioner if there is no shaving cream. Scrub the skin before and after to prevent ingrown hairs. Then for a couple of weeks endure the itchiness as your body adjusts to it. Now I&#039;m shaved all the time, it feels nice and sensual.",

It\u2019s data entry but for a serious organisation (not trying to be vague, don\u2019t want to dox myself). Long story short I\u2019m a bit shit at it. I make lots of mistakes without realising it, don\u2019t get some of it and even after having extra training and there are serious repercussions if something goes wrong because of the seriousness of the job. I\u2019m having to go in for extra training all the time, getting everything wrong and losing motivation; my supervisors are noticing and I think I\u2019m at the end of the line. <br>I think leaving is the only option at this point but I\u2019m terrified. My parents will go mental. They\u2019re already always pissed because I\u2019m an autist and have no friends/life so losing this will drive them up the wall. I get four days off after working six shifts of alternating hours, the pay is decent for what it is and I get to work from home, I\u2019ll never come across a job like this again and it\u2019s just data entry but I keep mucking it up and I don\u2019t think I can do it. I have enough saved to pay my dad rent for months but I\u2019ve heard the job market is brutal (UK) and they\u2019ll be on my case until I get a job again only made worse by the fact I\u2019ll just be a jobless shut-in again. I haven\u2019t told them I\u2019ve been struggling for months because I\u2019m scared shitless of how they\u2019ll react and now I think I\u2019ll either get fired or quit myself.

It&#039;s not like you can wag your finger at them and hold up a rule book of relationships and demanding they act according to what you tell them a healthy relationship should look like. Even if they were collectively becoming immature, so what? What are you going to do about it? They did because they can and that&#039;s the way it is now. Barring a major societal event, or a critical mass of men changing the tides of relationship dynamics, that&#039;s the way things will be, because women have no real reason to change their ways, since if you are right, they get to have their cake and eat it too.",

This is a white lie situation. A no-win scenario akin to &quot;does this dress make me look fat?&quot; If she brings it up just say you&#039;ll always love her and your main concern would be health. That&#039;s the normal tactful response.<br><br>Breaking up with her is a bit extreme. With the caveat about how she&#039;s treating you. Her holding this concern is one thing. If she&#039;s constantly reminding you and ranting and threatening you about it, that&#039;s another thing.",

It should be illegal; and happily, that&#039;s where we&#039;re headed. Obviously there&#039;s the basic moral point that if physically assaulting an adult is bad, assaulting a child is necessarily worse. But more than that, it simply doesn&#039;t work. Punishments like this don&#039;t teach a child not to do something, they simply teach them to try harder not to get caught next time. And, even worse, you&#039;re teaching them a lesson by your own example; and the lesson you&#039;re teaching them is: &quot;If you are bigger and stronger than someone, it&#039;s okay to use force or the threat of force to make them do what you want.&quot; That is not a lesson you want to be teaching your child. I remember years ago I saw a study which found an almost straight line relationship between how often a man was physically punished as a child, and the probability of him using force to obtain sex as an adult. This should not come as a surprise to anyone.",

You believe you should have everything handed to you on a silver platter, and if things get difficult or uncomfortable then you feel justified in giving up and spending your life whining about it. There are lots of people who will choose the drugs no matter the circumstances, people who have every advantage in life and who still choose to throw it away. You aren&#039;t some special poetic tortured soul who is being unjustly tormented. Life is hard and it&#039;s hard for everyone. Yes, in some ways life is harder today because paradoxically it&#039;s also much easier. But love and connection haven&#039;t been taken away from you.

Isekai is a genre of Japanese media where a character, typically a human from this world, travels or reincarnates in another world, typically a medieval swords-and-magic one.<br>A common trope of Isekai is the MC using his knowledge of the advanced technological civilization he comes from to improve his life and the world he now inhabits. Sometimes the protagonists even become kings and build their very own civilizations.<br>I like this genre and thus I daydream about it. I have wondered, what steps would I have to take to build my own civilization? How can I protect my civilization from getting destroyed? And conversely, how can I destroy the civilizations of my enemies?<br>That is why I cannot see all this LGBTQKJSDFASD bullshit as nothing more but crass attempts at civilizational destruction.<br>Sow discord, harm communal identity, poison the food and water supply, then tell the isolated hormonally-imbalanced youngsters to chop off their genitals, turn homosexual, accept a trillion foreigners--eunuchs and homos can&#039;t maintain civilization.<br>In my Kingdom, LGBTQAJSKFD would be forbidden on penalty of execution, and my spies would promote it nonstop in my enemies&#039; territories. Then when their birthrate falters, I would send trillions of my &quot;refugees&quot; sleeper cells into their walls, cities and villages.",

It goes beyond the single dichotomy of &quot;hitting good/bad&quot; and more about breaking down specific scenarios.

I remember when it strongly pushed people to cancel their default income protection insurance, ignoring the financial risk that creates. In herpes discussions, Reddit often downplayed the risk of transmission, yet in other threads, users admitted they\u2019d avoid kissing someone with a history of cold sores. <br><br>There\u2019s also a consistent bias toward advising breakups, even when a relationship might be worth saving. While sentiment on Reddit changes over time, these moments stand out to me as clear failures of collective advice, especially when I look back across posts from different years.<br><br>Reddit is great for seeing different perspectives based on what&#039;s trending and contextualised by the post, but it\u2019s risky to treat it like a trusted advisor. The loudest voices aren\u2019t always the wisest.",

I was already spergy when I started so I don\u2019t blame them for bullying someone like that nor do I blame them entirely for how I ended up but how they treated me went far beyond the norm and did severe damage to my social skills, self-esteem and overall mental state that I am still trying to undo to this day. <br>At the risk of bragging, I now have good job, earn lots, am fit and probably more attractive than half of them yet despite becoming \u2018better\u2019 all I want is for them to feel as miserable and helpless as I did and then some. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s immature, bitter, or spiteful, I want nothing more than harass them on social media endlessly until they give up. I want to make deepfakes and other things that would make me lose my job and get arrested but I just don\u2019t care anymore. Don\u2019t care if it\u2019s edgy, I just want them to suffer. For every old bully who\u2019s a fat fast food worker is one who never got comeuppance and is undeservingly happy and confident.<br>Call it a LARP, therapy didn\u2019t help and I\u2019ve nowhere else to ask. My restraint is thinning by the day and I will end up doing something stupid. Is there any way to let go of these grudges, forgot about them or just keep myself away?",

They saw you being okay with yourself, being innocent, being unmarked by misery and not at the mercy of peer pressure, just trying to be yourself. And they hated it. Because it reminded them of what they lost, it forced them to see how fucked up they were in comparison. And they wanted your happiness or innocence snuffed out, that way they bring you down to their level. Just as you wanna bring em down to yours now in present day. <br><br>You could try to do that.

For good. You lose your soul, in a manner of speaking. Take that literally or not, up to you. But that inner child in you loses their saviour when you go down the emptiness of vengeance.

I did, and whatever fleeting sense of catharsis I felt from doing so has been completely overtaken by guilt, shame, and self-loathing. It really does feel like I lost a part of my soul by choosing to give in to those urges, and I&#039;ll never be able to undo the damage I caused or be the person I was beforehand. It&#039;s a life sentence, and one that I have no one to blame for but myself. The worst part is that my desire for revenge hasn&#039;t even gone away, it&#039;s just directed at different people now. Absolutely nothing good came from acting on those desires, all it&#039;s done is make me a more bitter, selfish person. It&#039;s not worth it, trust me.",

Love is when you care about someone more than yourself. When you want to make them happy. When the mere thought of hurting them emotionally or physically causes a stabbing pain in your chest. Ask yourself this - if that &quot;hot&quot; girl became injured and couldn&#039;t have sex anymore, would you still want to spend the rest of your life with her? If the answer is no, then you don&#039;t love her. You want her body.",

In prehistoric Africa (where we all evolved) a couple would fall in love/lust, she would get pregnant immediately, she would have the baby, breast feed it, eventually wean it (which would take a year or so), and then the two of them would typically split up and find new partners, and she would get pregnant again. So there can be an extremely intense feeling of love in the very early stages; but within about 18 months or maybe two years (max) it always fades. And after that it makes no difference whatever whether you *were* feeling it before or not, because you aren&#039;t now. So, literally NO ONE &quot;can confidently say they&#039;re married to the person of their dreams&quot;; outside the honeymoon period, nobody feels that.",

I&#039;m not even sure she really wanted it, I think at best she thinks she wanted it but wasn&#039;t willing to put in the work it entailed which is what ultimately separates her from me in a core way.<br>I found someone later and fumbled them, completely. Well, we both were on just irreconcilable different courses in life when we met. No matter what, it was never gonna happen. I think that also contributes to my depression.<br>Once I realized my kids needed something better (if I quit what I did to do the single dad thing we wouldn&#039;t be able to keep what we have and nobody would win) I kinda started looking at other options for a partner, long-term. Call me a POS if you want to but as far as I&#039;m concerned you can be unfaithful to someone in a marriage in a lot of ways than just what people typically think of as infidelity. I think sabotaging the life you&#039;re building for someone and never telling them they don&#039;t want what you&#039;re doing even after you&#039;ve put the work in is a real stab in the back, don&#039;t you?<br>Like my wife literally thought I would either give up or she could make me. I can&#039;t ever look over that, nevermind everything else.<br>My problem now is I have no idea where to go from here at nearly 30 and my motivation to get up again is lower than ever before. The plan I do have, I don&#039;t have the same convictions for it I have others.<br>Basically everything in life I have chosen to invest in turned out to not payout, in the end.

Those things you listed though, they&#039;re good actions of taking care of your body and physical needs. I am talking about inner-workings, things like attitudes towards yourself as a person, or the way which you view yourself as a person inside. Not so much the outside. Because if you have little development or have a vicious view on your self inside, it won&#039;t matter how you look or what you do for the body.

Get some self respect.<br><br><a href=\"#p33394352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33394352</a><br>But to answer the op, this post nails it desu. Sex is just the cherry on top when you meet a girl you can just fuck around and laugh with and be yourself around imo. When she gets you. When you want to be around her. No girl is ever gonna fully understand you obviously but god, learning to love a woman who can constantly make you laugh is one of the greatest mortal joys I got to experience, and it probably won&#039;t happen again.<br><br>Some people like to hype up body count or sexual experience, but I always treasured her character and personality long before sex ever happened, and I think that&#039;s the most important thing you can feel you miss out on-- another genuine soul. But most of us don&#039;t even get that when we do get into relationships, mostly because they put sex at the forefront, I think. Everyone has their own values though, when it comes to people, and what you seek from them.<br><br>You aren&#039;t &quot;missing out&quot; of anything measurable though. Nothing anyone can tell you on an individual level in regards to YOU. You&#039;re asking an impossible question because what you have with another individual may have parallels to other relationships, but it will always be unique to you and the other person. You might have the potential for a grand love if you find the right person. You might not. You can only know what you&#039;re missing out on after it leaves you.",

She wasn&#039;t &quot;everything you wanted.&quot; She had kids and probably a fuckton of baggage you wouldn&#039;t see until later. Trust me, she isn&#039;t all you probably think she is now. No one with different baby daddies is ever, ever, ever gonna change and be a good option for anything other than the history that proceeds them. Remember that if you meet another girl. You have to VET THEM. If you don&#039;t at least know them as friends for half a year don&#039;t consider moving forward with anything. <br><br>But shit happens and some of us learn faster than others. Honestly it isn&#039;t something you can look for. It can appear before you, you can recognize it, and choose your actions, but love can&#039;t be hunted. And relationships are just what two people choose to do with each other-- and it does take TWO people. It all falls apart the minute someone gets cold feet. And that happens often.<br><br>It&#039;s easy to get imaginative and dream about some perfect relationship, but just remember what you experienced here. Everyone is just some flawed person and that&#039;s something you need to accept in a relationship. It&#039;s not really a blessing anymore than it is a challenge and a growing experience, and yes it can be rewarding, but I think that comes with maturity, and as a general rule of thumb, you won&#039;t find something you feel you&#039;re missing out on with some used up whore with kids. She would not give you what you want even if you did get with her. Live and learn and move on, man.",

Grieve if you have to. Don&#039;t be ashamed to cry. It helps drastically to process what you feel instead of holding it in or becoming resentful or wishing it went some different way. I went through a lot of different emotions losing the first girl I was really close to recently and it makes you reflect a lot. It isn&#039;y really so bad to fumble with hoes not worth your time, though. Those are still valuable learning experiences. They&#039;re still women, and you can learn a lot from their behaviors. If you see those kinds of signs in a future woman you&#039;ll know how close or far you need to stay to her. Stay humble. Watch your own heart a little closer next time. Don&#039;t hand it to a callous woman so easily",

I know it sounds obvious but you need to remind yourself of the relationship you have with your devices.<br>There are some things you can do on the software level like using screentime tools (<a href=\"#p33397584\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33397584</a>) or a time saving browser like Firefox Focus that throws away session info and tabs. All good things, but you have to address the root cause, which is that your attention is not actively directed and you doomscroll etc. And overall I don\u2019t believe changing your device configuration is a complete solution; you have to orient your self governance away from the software world. Your phone or whatever forcing you to sit stoically in a quiet room is not going to help.<br>Not to be rude but I\u2019m guessing you don\u2019t have a lot of friends or hobbies keeping your mind busy and focused. I\u2019d suggest picking up a sport like pickup soccer, or martial arts like BJJ. Those things force you to focus for an hour or more, and open you up to opportunities for social events where you have to be present.<br>Non-internet hobbies like photography, or woodworking, or writing, or whatever help too but it\u2019s easier to be held accountable by being involved with a group rather than building something alone while you are so easily distracted. And please for God\u2019s sake put any videogames in the attic.<br>If you want to start small, try making a habit to leave the phone at home and going for a walk in your neighborhood for half an hour to an hour. Rain or shine whatever just get out there. That will at least start to get you in the mind to be present.<br>The fact you acknowledge the problem is also a terrific start. I\u2019ve struggled with that in the past too but have also made great strides. You can do it anon.",

The reality is that they are all interconnected. Looks boost your confidence, and confidence shapes your personality, which again factors into your perceived attractiveness. On the other hand, someone who is ugly and getting rejected all the time has a harder time staying motivated and being confident, which may cause him to become more cynical and closed off, which makes him seem less attractive, thus creating a negative feedback loop.",

Most funny people aren&#039;t really trying to be funny unless there&#039;s some stand-up comedian. They just are. Which means YOU are likely still funny but either can&#039;t or won&#039;t express it due to mental blocks. If possible I recommend finding a group of friends that you feel very comfortable being yourself around. That&#039;s the first step. Both of my group of co-workers (I have one full-time job and one part-time) regularly call me funny and it&#039;s mostly because I feel comfortable being somewhat silly around them and saying what I find funny. They&#039;ll keep in mind you also have to know how to read the room and not say anything TOO stupid (I feel I have to say this not necessarily to you but to any ultra spergs that think edgy humor is funny. If you&#039;re into THAT kinda humor then make sure you&#039;re around a group that actually appreciates that.

No, that&#039;s not even remotely an exaggeration. Anyone that tries to tell me otherwise can pound sand. The dating market is garbage and even ultra normies admit it). You may not be a 11/10 Chad (I can&#039;t see for certain because, well, I don&#039;t know what you look like) but I can say with high confidence you aren&#039;t as bad looking as you think you are.",

Your motivation, to say so, your inner desire to perform those actions are there, your plans to do so are there too, but at the very moment of doing that, somehow, you just don&#039;t do it. It&#039;s not that you feel lazy, or you are depressed to not feel anything about it but suffering, but... you just don&#039;t do it, right?. Like, those mornings you have to take a cold shower and you know what it entails, you prepary mentally, you even take some stretching and such and such... but at the very face of the bathroom, you sort of just get out of yourself, derealize, dissociate, or whatever, like those guys from military when they have that thousand yards look and stay there for minutes, even hours? <br><br>It happens to me too, and it&#039;s been somewhat of a constant in my life for a while now. I think i&#039;ve lost a couple of even life-changing opportunities like jobs or more promising academic pursuits...though it has taken a seatback in the last two years in the scale of damage because a vile form of OCD (pure o) struck me and took me to the limit of suicide. <br><br>I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s more of a personality thing, a result of a relatively acommodated childhood but emotionally distant from my parents where i didn&#039;t get that much correction (though i got some spankings here and there but nothing to take a trauma from) and thus a lack of prioritizing abilities, or just some side effect of an unknown mental disease. Maybe it&#039;s what this anon <a href=\"#p33375001\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;33375001</a> says, and by reading the wikipedia article, there&#039;s some sort of herb that might be promising for that...but i&#039;m just too fearful it might mess with my current medication and turn my brain to a worse mush.",

Sometimes i just do things i should do in a day because fuck it, my mind feels more at ease and more active than usual...or, after a depressive cycle of sorts where i rot for days (i don&#039;t get out of my room, don&#039;t brush my teeth, don&#039;t take a bath, i don&#039;t give a shit if i smell like a fucking donkey), usually when i finally take a bath, i feel anger and an impulse to resume what i do very quickly, so i try to do a lot of shit that day. But that&#039;s not a sane way to get myself to do stuff because after that impulse i feel like i&#039;ve wasted too much time rotting inside my house and i&#039;m too behind everything and it&#039;s all dispair again and blablabla.<br><br>I think the most effective way to avoid this is, when you wake up, avoid using what usually gets you in trances of addiction or short span attention, like using the computer or the phone just after waking up (though, for people like you and i, it&#039;s almost like a robotic response so we have to put extra effort). And when you are in THAT MOMENT where you are just about to start to do your chores, just not think about anything and throw yourself, no dissociation, no thinking, just fucking do it and think about it later.",

Avolition is the appropriate word to describe what you&#039;re experiencing here, though it&#039;s usually associated with neurological disorders like depression or schizophrenia spectrum disorders.<br>Difficulty or inability to initiate purposeful, self-directed behaviour, in your case, I would wager is being caused by either ADHD/autism (two sides of the same coin neurologically speaking), or organic brain damage from technology and internet overuse. 4chan, drug use, Youtube, Instagram, television, movies, video games, porn, whatever, are supernormal stimuli and are more than capable of bankrupting your brain&#039;s natural balance of neurotransmitters if you are not careful. This, in turn, will result in a situation like you are describing, wherein you can &quot;want&quot; to do things but find yourself struggling to &quot;will&quot; yourself to do them.",

        "com": "This question is not really possible to answer without knowing a lot more about the situation. People who legitimately don&#039;t care for sex or hate it exist, and even more commonly people that do like it but don&#039;t quite &quot;get the hype&quot;. I feel everyone loves sex in the way everyone loves music: it&#039;s difficult to find someone who truly outright hates any and all music, but that doesn&#039;t mean the music lover isn&#039;t a whole big ass spectrum from mindless radio listeners to professional musicians that live and breathe music and everything in between. <br><br>That said, I also feel kind of hesitant to encourage people to simply embrace that sex is not really their thing because I do feel nobody likes sex until they&#039;ve had good sex. It is not an uncommon experience to not like sex at all with a few partners and then you get with someone you have much more chemistry with, feel much more attracted to, are much more sexually compatible with or whatever and it suddenly clicks why everyone goes crazy for this. So I feel that encouraging people fast to just think of themselves as on the ace spectrum also kind of discourages them from exploring more to be sure... <br><br>Besides it is also quite normal/common when inexperienced to not realize your nerves or lack of feelings for the person were what made you go through the motions instead of being in the moment and that makes a day and night difference. The body can shut anything out. Sex feeling like a bunch of nothing could mean something physical but also that you got so locked into your head you literally couldn&#039;t feel your body much anymore. Nobody enjoys sex like that but that&#039;s not how it&#039;s supposed to be, it&#039;s the equivalent to mindlessly chewing without tasting a thing.",

I&#039;ve never had a pet dog, I don&#039;t know what to do with a dog let alone someone else&#039;s dog. She suggested the date and wants to see me next weekend but &quot;I have to plan it&quot; and I have no fucking idea what to do.<br><br>I&#039;ve had a nightmare date at an arcade thing where I missed a basketball 50 times in a row, got a shit score on the bag thing that you punch, failed completely at air hockey and she was filming me and sent it to a group chat where her friends were openly mocking me over my non existent hand eye coordination.<br>I went to a pool bar and couldn&#039;t play pool to save my life. I went to 10 pin bowling and sent every ball into the gutter. I have extreme anxiety and ALWAYS get flustered going to any food place because I don&#039;t know what to order because I&#039;ve not tried it before.<br><br>Everything that I am is one gigantic ick to women",

When I was 18 in 2023 I had a lucid dream (only one I&#039;ve ever had) where a spirit showed me sunken continents thousands of years ago. Since then she&#039;s talked to me through thoughts in a way similar to what you&#039;re describing. She says she knew me in my past life and came looking for me, funnily enough my past life apparently first met her in an NDE as well. At first I thought I was crazy too but she&#039;s proved to me a few times that she really is a separate entity. Over the last couple years we&#039;ve developed a good relationship I think and pretty much come to terms with one another. Would be very interested to hear what you have to think and compare experiences. My discord is synth_m4n if you want to add me also",

Another man owned my gf more than I ever have. I&#039;ve nutted in her, but she&#039;s always been on birth control so my seed never entered her egg. His has. It makes me sick thinking about. I&#039;m thinking about pulling back some of my feelings for her. Taking a step back to not be as close. I&#039;ve been with her for 3 years now. I love her so much. I&#039;ve always been insecure about all of my gfs past sex life before me. But I&#039;ve never been as close to a girl like I am with my current gf. I see her like an extension of my self. So knowing this about her makes me feel disgusted because I don&#039;t fucking know this man but he&#039;s apart of my woman&#039;s body forever now. His DNA stored in her egg. Should I break up with her? What do y&#039;all think about this? Am I taking this too hard?",

I still talk to her and her boyfriend, and I even helped her get a job at her new place because a buddy of mine worked there, but she&#039;s more cautious about how she presents herself, and tries her best to be mindful about her behavior (unless it&#039;s just the two of us, then she lets loose like old times). But it still sucks to see a genuine friendship go through the ringer just because people apparently can&#039;t fathom gender and age differences between adults.

Being hot makes your life sm better. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pic related : me in my youth</span><br>Some people win the genetic lottery, yes. But i was really ugly before i glew up. I was also born poor asf. My life was insanely chaotic but people dont understand life is essentially a test. Once you realize this, you level up, like a pokemon. I was poor asf, ugly, no real oppurtunities, and was born into a family of death. I survived hell and now i live like a king. Life isnt what you make it, its passing tests with grace and humility and letting God upgrade you in ways He sees fit. I can teach you how to reach greatness, but this level of discernment and God-appeasing method is my most valuable treasure. There are no &quot;self help&quot; guides that can teach you this. I might write a book about it and give it away for free. Those who can fathom how to make God, your good Father, happy, impressed, and satisfied that He created you, goodness and mercy will follow you all of your life and mankind will evolve at an amazing rate. He will even help you with things that the church looks down upon. For example i really struggled with my identity and sexuality, and being a lil more feminine than masculine. I was led to content of Link depicted in yaoi, and seeing that healed me. You would think God would smite you for consuming porn, but i didnt beat off or anything. He works in mysterious ways, but now i embrace how i look and thinking about exploring that part of me now. I also dont care what people think because my life is full of respectable accomplishments. Im rambling but hope this helps.",

It was such a unique period to grow up in as consumer technology rapidly got better and better. I have great fondness for the era between 2003-2013. I do know that my parents suffered trying to provide for us, however.<br>Last night I had a dream where I was walking inside a mall in the year 1992.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;What year is this anyway? 1992?</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Yeah&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;I was spot-on? It is 1992?&quot;</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Yup.&quot;</span><br>The way that people lived there -- fully socially present in the moment. Something I caught the shadow of in my upbringing was life in this era. I especially noted how many adults were working in this mall. Grown-ups who were making an actual living on such simple service jobs. I felt such a profound mourning of never having experienced this period for myself.<br>How do I cope with this truly? How do I cope with knowing that things are not shaping up to get better, despite my generation supposedly being the &quot;strong men creating good times&quot;? What good in the world is there for my small children?",

Face/Off is still great, and if you disagree because you think it&#039;s too corny, you have allowed modernity to kill your soul. Watch the final scene of that movie.

However, this town + living with parents is not very conducive to social growth. There isn\u2019t shit to do here, I don\u2019t have any irl friends and I mostly just lay in bed after work. If I moved I\u2019m not sure what rent would be. I would likely see if one of my old college roommates would be interested in living together again. Definitely higher but not outrageous, maybe like $1200/month depending on location.<br><br>The other caveat is that currently I am afforded the ability to work fully remote because I am far enough away from my company office. If I move to the metro, I would likely be expected to come into the office 2 days per week.<br><br>What would you guys do in this situation? When I was in college I really didn\u2019t like city living, but if the alternative is not having any friends or being able to meet anyone, it may be worth it.",

It might be tempting to play along, because it gives a temporary sense of self, a fleeting sense of control over the things you can&#039;t help feeling or not feeling, but don&#039;t take the bait.

You know this, right? You fear disappointing others or being judged by others intensely. And you also know that romantic and/or sexual connections are very intensely intimate and high-stakes connections. So it follows: Your lack of desire for romance or sex is because an intense connection means risking intense and inhuman amounts of fear of disappointing. That&#039;s why you feel you are aro/ace. <br><br>You&#039;re someone who fears the risks of connection. That&#039;s all. And if you wanna stand a chance at dispelling fear or growing bigger than it, you should avoid sticking to labels. It will only make you surrender.

This person is bitter that I will not be his friend anymore and is stalking and harassing me with no signs of letting up. If anything it&#039;s gotten worse; last night he doxed me on Kick, and he&#039;s posted multiple disgusting videos to youtube where he threatens me and blackmails me into contacting him. I refuse to talk with him. I made it clear I wanted him to leave me alone. He calls me when I live stream to let me know he is watching me even though he is banned from using the platform. Local police here are completely dropping the ball and passing the buck on it. Idk how he got my personal information but he is using it to harm me and my reputation and instill fear in me. I have a mountain of evidence to show his harassment but because I don&#039;t have his physical address, even if I file the order they won&#039;t serve him with it which means it won&#039;t be in effect. The police laughed at me telling me it wasn&#039;t their job to find where this guy lives, it&#039;s my job.

I actually ended up contacting one of my local news channels to tell them about what I&#039;ve been going through and they sound like they may wanna do a story about it. I was told by my local police to contact his local police, and when I told them I&#039;d tried that already I was told they were closing out the case and that that would help me be able to talk to his local police. Of course that was utter nonsense. I&#039;m working on the HRO right now but I&#039;m worried about not having enough of this guys information. Someone suggested calling my districts house or state rep? Not sure what they could do exactly. Honestly any help with this is sincerely appreciated. His Twitch and Kick have been suspended but he literally said in multiple vids that even though he is banned he will be watching me, he has said my full legal name and that he knows where i live and that he will be sending people to my apartment. I will include another piece of evidence with this reply. This is one of the reports I made to the FBI beginning of last week. Also I wanna add, the more avenues to contact me from that get cut off the more this guy is becoming unhinged. Lord knows what he will do today when he realizes his Kick was suspended...",

If law enforcement isn&#039;t assisting, an HRO is the way to go. <br><br>Ideally you would hire a lawyer to handle this. I am assuming you are poor. If that&#039;s right:<br><br>Yes, you do need to serve them with the summons after you initiate the HRO proceeding, and obviously your local sheriff or whatever can&#039;t personally serve a guy whose address you don&#039;t know (or probably a guy out of state at all, for that matter). You have the individual&#039;s name and you know what state they&#039;re in. Have you exhausted the tools you have to learn their address? Property records? Voting records?<br><br>Assuming you have, unfortunately MN is a pretty restrictive state as far as alternatives to personal service. If you have the resources, hire a California skiptrace company. Their job is finding people like your stalker so they can be served.<br><br>Failing all that MN Code Section 609.748(1)(b) is what you want. File a motion with your petition asking for leave to satisfy service with a one week published notice and attach an affidavit saying that (a) the police informed you that they could not effect personal service because the defendant is concealing his address (which is what I understand you to be saying the cops told you) and (b) their residence and place of business are not known to you, except that you know he resides in California.<br><br>In principle this should then allow you to merely have a California newspaper run a notice for a week instead of having him served at his address.<br><br>You should also just have somebody other than yourself send him the filed petition electronically and ask him point blank if he will accept service of process. He may, people do retarded shit. But if nothing else he&#039;ll then be aware of the proceeding and may get spooked.<br><br>Good luck.",
