Cheap wool usually contains more lanolin than more expensive wool, and the individual wool fibers are more coarse. Merino contains very little lanolin and has very fine fibers. The later makes it better for people with lanolin allergies while the fine fibers make the material softer for people with sensitive skin. <br><br>Llama, alpaca, and vicu\u00f1a are all lanolin free and have very fine fibers (that latter being insanely soft but also very expensive).

It is also the least forested western US state with less than 16% forest cover (the 13 state average for the western US is 33% forest) and of this forest cover more than half is just juniper scrub (not real canopy forest). It is also one of the least biodiverse US states outside of the great plains (the least biodiverse region in the US, even less diverse than Arctic Alaska) for its size and latitude. The reason Nevada is almost completely a desert is due specifically to the Sierra mountain range in California and the fact that NV is too far in the interior to get the humid climates and monsoons from the Pacific ocean like Arizona (which legitimately has actually year round humid forests in canyons, pic related, Arizona at 5,000 elevation). NV is also too far west to get the most of the bend in the Alaska gyre jetstream in winter also like Arizona and Utah that deliver hundreds of inches of winter snow every year to huge 5,000+ sq mi regions of Arizona, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico. Also due to NV&#039;s terrain and natural geography and the predominant climate patterns of the eastern Pacific ocean, Nevada has the fewest number of natural perennial streams and rivers in the western US, having less than New Mexico (which also has less than AZ) and than half as many as Arizona. NV is the only state that is actually seriously threatened with water supply issues as every other western US state gets most of its water from precipitation that falls in its boundaries and in tributaries above the Colorado river, NV depends wholly on the Colorado river and unsustainable ground water. In the last 24 hrs it has rained more than 2 inches at my house here in AZ, and this is just the start of the monsoon and it is typical for multiple events like that in wet monsoon years here. Nevada is literally 85-95% desert.",

That hostel isn\u2019t an example of that stereotype, it\u2019s the source. I\u2019m not joking. <br><br>It\u2019s had that reputation for a long time. I thought it was overblown until I saw it myself. The people there are lowlifes (or carry a lowlife aura or whatever). <br><br>I stated that the facility can be terrible because of their location. What I meant was that their location is so ideal there\u2019s no incentive to change. A LOT of people stop there out of necessity.<br><br>From Fontana Damn (the SW entrance to GSMNP), it\u2019s ~75 miles to Standing Bear (at the far NE entrance). That stretch of trail through the park is an insanely popular section hike. The logistics work in favor of Standing Bear; people stay there and shuttle to the other side of the park, and hike across its entire length along the AT. It\u2019s a fun 6 night hike. <br><br>For thruhikers, there\u2019s a resupply at Fontana Village (not ideal; it\u2019s a mail drop and only open until noon), or they can hitchhike to Gatlinburg from the center of the park (which is illegal and enforced in Gatlinburg, so again, not ideal). It\u2019s still early and most people aren\u2019t doing 30 mile days (you have to stay in shelters there, and it\u2019s ~15 miles between each one). If they skip Standing Bear, it\u2019s another 25 miles to the next hostel and resupply (Mountain Harbor). <br><br>So 100 miles from a mail drop that you might be a day late getting because they close super early, hitchhike into a town that\u2019s an hour away (illegal, very expensive hotels because tourist city, need a shuttle back), or stay at the hostel that\u2019s right there. <br><br>Also, because it\u2019s early, a lot of the party crowd hasn\u2019t dropped out yet. So you get a lot of these people congregating in one place.",

Sort of like, after they&#039;ve passed the ritual, where as you mentioned so many people fail, they have to justify that experience to themselves. I&#039;m not saying that it&#039;s a bad thing, but those types of behaviors are what I seek to get away from in hiking, all the materialistic crap of the modern world, but it seems, pass or fail, people bring that mentality with them wherever they go; guess that&#039;s human nature.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;without support from a team i dont see this being possible.</span><br>I actually met a couple people who pushed over 40 mile days. But they were seasoned veterans, people that have been doing this for a long ass time. Learned a lot talking to them. Basically you start before dawn, hike for 14-16 hours, and try to average a 3MPH pace. They were all very light weight, though some were heavier builds and managed more weight, and they didn&#039;t stop to fill water too often because the extra weight would slow them down.<br>On my best day I did 28.5 Miles, and that was with 10Lbs of useless weight in my bag, and hiking with a partner who wanted to go a little slower.<br>Members of the American Tribe have a similar premise, where way back when they would travel light weight and cover long distances.",

Nudity in the outdoors is liberating and arousing, but the appeal for me is doing it in solitude- going to a designated beach or resort has no appeal to me.",

For one, they usually don&#039;t get naked; if they actually do take they&#039;re clothes off, 99% of the time they&#039;ll start masturbating eventually, which gives everyone else on the beach cause to chase them off the beach. I once witnessed a group of about 6 women I was with chase off a perv with sticks, it was fucking hilarious. <br><br>More often than not, they&#039;ll show up alone, not dressed for recreation (i.e. cargo shorts instead of swim trunks, sneakers, always sunglasses) and just prowl up and down the beach. If they actually try to post up somewhere to attempt to &quot;conspicuously&quot; take creep shots, they will 100% be confronted and chased off the beach. Again, I&#039;ve seen this happen a handful of times at the beach I go to. <br><br><a href=\"#p2812092\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2812092</a><br>100% agree. This is true for most things too, like weed culture. Oh, and swingers are especially cringe. Whenever I hear/see people talking about being in &quot;the lifestyle&quot;, it&#039;s like &quot;ok I get it, you maintained your virginity until your 30s, and now you have to make your whole personality be SEX to make sure everyone knows that you fuck now.&quot;",

I&#039;m on 4chan after all, that should show how I am, or at least how I was. Best advice i can say is put yourself out there and try and find a group with commeon interest, but i know its easier said than done for some people. Regardless, im rooting for you!<br><br>Most of the time we stay in the pool, but we&#039;ll float around outside. We also play a game that&#039;s a mix of rugby and basketball, and whoever throws a ball outside the pool gets out to get it. Not to mention sitting by the fire and whatnot as well, or getting out for a beer. Also depends how warm it is at night. Some nights hover around 65F, which isn&#039;t bad if you&#039;re dry, but pretty cold when you&#039;re soaked.",

There are two swimming pools (I think) included with your 10$ daily ticket though on the property (it&#039;s a linear park of sorts). <br>It looked like there was a way you could go to the bottom of the gorge and across to the other side but I&#039;m not sure where that leads and it was marked off with a barrier but very intriguing. Most of the trail is the west rim and its kinda a combined road/trail like the trail runs along the road so you can walk or drive or any combination and there&#039;s three waterfalls and a bunch of little overlooks too. <br>The first waterfall is the most crowded and has a tall railroad bridge above it, there was a parking lot ABOVE the first waterfall, and that was the only FULL parking I encountered, though the weather was crappy when I went (cold and drizzling). I&#039;m not 100% sure what that parking was all about maybe a different view. You can also take a damn HOT AIR BALLOON above the gorge but I&#039;m sure that&#039;s at least 500$ a person. Definitely worth it if you can.<br><br>Eat before you visit. There&#039;s a little food vending thing at the first upper waterfall but it&#039;s probably not that great unless you are emergency hungry. <br><br>My biggest issue with jeets is they take incredibly careful selfies and just stand there for 10 seconds holding the camera composing the shot I dunno what&#039;s going on with that and they do not stop talking the whole time so good luck getting videos when they are there. <br><br>You can either walk from the upper falls to the middle falls or re-park, the middle falls is the money shot, it&#039;s not as tol as Taughhannock Falls but it&#039;s much wider and thus much more impressive when flowing well. There&#039;s also mini-subsidiary waterfalls running off the sides - making it extra pretty. If you can somehow get to the bottom of middle falls, I don&#039;t know how it looked impossible to me.",

From there you find a couple more overlooks - for me they were great and I really enjoyed the overlooks as much as the waterfalls and you can see into the distance at some of them and the canyon walls are sheer vertical, unlike the unglaciated Red River Gorge to the SW. <br><br>The you get to Lower Falls - keep RIGHT at the road fork for the quickest path. There&#039;s a &quot;quick&quot; view flat path to a view of lower falls or 100+ steps (not bad actually) built by the CCC (all of these parks are really CCC built) to a closer overlook where you WILL get sprayed on by lower falls and there&#039;s also a bridge (foot) across the gorge where the barrier was I mentioned earlier. Seems like these areas are very subject to landslides. <br>Again, I saw no way to get to the bottom bottom of Lower Falls but maybe there is one. Seemed super dangerous without a rope anyways. <br>Then from Lower Falls the gorge kinda flattens out a bit and turns into farmland (sort of reminiscent of Pine Creek Gorge in PA how its surrounded by farms on the rim in some places) and there&#039;s a few more meh-ish overlooks until you get to the dam and then the gorge ends. It sort of pops out of nowhere which is cool, unlike the maze of chutes and ladders level after level of intersecting gorges you get in WV for comparison. <br><br>I&#039;m really tired I&#039;ll have more photos tomorrow sorry this thread has been shit for you I wanna make it good.",

I do recall reading on one the plaques that a guy built a cabin on the far side of the gorge in one of the places and lived there I guess before the railroad came through or something. Something like they built a new bridge and his cabin was obsolete cuz he was helping people get through the area. <br><br>Anyways, this is secret falls. I dunno if it has an actual name but you could see it from one of the overlooks and there was I think an adjacent parking lot that was full-ish where maybe people were hiking to the falls from there. I&#039;d go back and do secret falls. <br><br>Also, I wanna say somewhere in same rough area is Zoar Valley that has some old growth and a gorge so maybe I will go back there and do it, AND I have to figure out the shuttle timing to do Watkins Glen. I did a little bit of it but it was getting dark and I found TWO random waterfalls instead before dark. Watkins Glen is like mini-letchworth its all packed into one tiny holler that&#039;s 500 ft top to bottom. <br><br>I do save some stuff anons tell me and then go there. Not that it&#039;s rare or anything but that&#039;s how I found Grandview in New River Gorge and I always go there when I&#039;m in the area.",

I&#039;ve been to Red River before but it was 100 degrees and I didn&#039;t get much done. <br>I&#039;ve done Chimney Top, so I guess I could do Hanson&#039;s Point which is kinda the mirror image reverse, but I prefer shorter (2-3 mi or less) hikes where possible. <br>There&#039;s also Cloudsplitter but I feel like the ONLY way to get onto that is by some scrambly-rock climbing that&#039;s above my ability set. <br>And then I guess the main one most people do is Courthouse Rock. <br>Also interested in any trails you recommend in the area or nearby. I can&#039;t really do anything super strenuous but I don&#039;t mind driving on a gravel road to get to a weird trailhead and I have 4WD. <br><br>Also, doesn&#039;t need to be IN Red River proper, I&#039;m interested in the surround area as well. <br><br>Also was thinking of combining Red River with Ohio River for some more views but I think I&#039;ve DONE the only bluff-from-above view of the Ohio between Pittsburgh and Cincinnati and that&#039;s also called Raven&#039;s Rock, I&#039;ve also done Edge of Appalachia view hike that&#039;s not the Ohio River but a tributary. <br>I also want to see that little island that is in the river near Parkersburg and do a tour of the Blennerhassett hotel if I can it had such a gorgeous interior.",

It&#039;s on the other side of the river from Seth Green Park where you access Norton&#039;s Falls. <br><br>The waterfall at Norton&#039;s Falls is less impressive than the ones on the Genesee, but has a small manmade cave above it that gives it some uniqueness. <br><br>Also in Rochester: Seneca Park and Turning Point Park have smaller waterfalls/cascades. Even if the falls have minimal flow, the parks are worth visiting. Seneca Park has a decent zoo but is also in a rough area with sketchy characters hanging out at times. Car break-ins are common and I saw a drug deal go down one time. Turning Point has scenic boardwalks and is great for birdwatching if you&#039;re into that. There&#039;s also Densmore Falls that you can walk to from the Irondequoit Middle School parking lot when school isn&#039;t in session. <br><br>Did you check out the other waterfalls in Montour Falls (She-Qua-Ga Falls, Aunt Sarah&#039;s Falls and Deckertown Falls)? My personal recommendation in that area is Excelsior Glen off Highway 414 in Watkins Glen. If you&#039;re comfortable with creekwalking and scaling cliffs, you can explore some neat areas in solitude. Empire Falls, a 120-foot cascade, is the biggest prize. Another good one is Templar Falls off the FLT where you rappel down using a rope. There&#039;s also good cliff-climbing in Sugar Hill SF that&#039;s similar to Zoar Valley that you mentioned in an earlier post. Hector Falls and Eldridge Falls are less adventurous options near Watkins Glen SP that are basically roadside stops. <br><br>Nyfalls.com, falzguy.com and the 200 Waterfalls in CNY &amp; WNY book are great resources for waterfalling in the region. <br><br><a href=\"#p2823454\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2823454</a><br>I have never been to /ck/ and live in Wyoming Co. so that&#039;s not me",

The state wanted to limit their liability after so many hikers, climbers, rafters, and paddlers died falling from cliffs or drowning in Cattaraugus Creek during high water periods. Your best bet is to hike the legal DEC trail down to Valentine Flats and then walk along the main branch past the confluence. There, you will encounter old growth strands along the bottom of the canyon, that extend for miles. Just monitor the water levels before you go. There are alternating creekwalking and shorewalking sections, plus some areas where you can wander into the woods without having to scale any steep cliffs. Summertime is usually best for exploration, though I have gone in all seasons including winter. <br><br>I would also recommend the Deer Lick Nature Preserve which is an extension of Zoar Valley. It has trails going right through old growth forests where you will find an impressive assortment of maples, oaks, hemlocks, beeches, birches, ashes, etc. There is also a small waterfall by a creek crossing plus obstructed views of the bigger waterfalls that cascade from the Cattaraugus Creek cliffs. However, getting closer to them requires trespassing. The nature conservancy posts the land and people have been charged with trespassing in the past. Winter is the best time for off-trail adventures at Deer Lick because the bushwhacking is easier and there&#039;s less chance of cops/sheriffs patrolling the area then. <br><br>Have fun with the new bike and let me know if you want recommendations for mtb, xc or gravel trails in the region. I usually stick to gravel until 4th of July weekend when I break out the mtb. The trails *usually* have dried out by then.

In the winter you can do any of the same trails (ammo, jewell, crawford path or edmunds) with microspikes and maybe snowshoes and more technical or steep routes (lions head, boott) requiring an ice axe and crampons.<br><br>What&#039;s more important is to give the weather a healthy amount of respect. There are plenty of winter days where you just do not want to go above the treeline and you need to be able to recognize that and be capable of reevaluating your situation midway through a hike and knowing when to turn around. <br><br>The bluebird days are an absolute breeze but mt washington is capable of some incredibly nasty weather.",

You should also check the higher summits forecast the night before, just to be sure you aren&#039;t walking into something nasty like early afternoon thundershowers; https://mountwashington.org/weather<wbr>/higher-summits-forecast/<br><br>My biggest safety tip is to let the weather dictate your plans, don&#039;t try to force a hike if the weather isn&#039;t cooperating. You can hike through snowfall, you can hike through high winds, but you really don&#039;t want to be topside in thunder and lightning. <br><br>If you have microspikes or poles, bring them for sure. There&#039;s almost certainly still ice and snowpack in the saddles between peaks and anywhere higher up where the spruce and fir protects it from the sun.",

Most people just follow establish trails and usually the snow is hardpacked unless you&#039;re out after fresh snow or you&#039;re very early season when not a lot of people have gone through them yet. Also if there&#039;s any actual ice &quot;climbing&quot; involved you have to switch to crampons. You simply can&#039;t do that with snowshoes. Also snowshoes are pretty big and bulky and the moment you no longer need them i&#039;d just take them off and put on spikes or crampons instead. A lot easier to move unless you&#039;re really postholing.",

It&#039;s possible to resharpen the spikes but many hikers instead opt to own two pairs, a fresh set that they use for snow hiking and a old set that they use in shoulder season, where there&#039;s more exposed rocks that wear down the spikes. The most concerning failure point is the rubber straps, which can fail catastrophically and completely without warning and a slight nick in the rubber can cause them to snap. I&#039;d treat microspikes as a &quot;wear component&quot; and replace them every few seasons, depending on how much use they get. <br> <span class=\"quote\">&gt;Boot Spikes</span><br> I would group some traction devices into an intermediate between microspikes and proper crampons, like Hillsound Trail Crampons Pro&#039;s or Kahtoola K-10&#039;s.

Modern snowshoes are extremely lightweight and can attach to most any footwear. When buying snowshoes I&#039;d look for ones that have a heel lifter (pic related), it makes such a world of difference when going uphill it feels like walking on flat ground. Trail snowshoes are often much larger than hiking-focused snowshoes, and provide more float and the weight rating are more suggestions than a hardset rule.<br> <span class=\"quote\">&gt;Crampons </span><br> I&#039;ve never worn crampons so I can&#039;t really speak much from personal experience, but from what I understand they&#039;re used on hard ice where you need genuinely sharp and hardened steel points to get traction and front points for extremely steep ascents.<br> <span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ice Axes</span><br> I don&#039;t have any experience with ice axes.<br>/2",

Crampons are a fairly expensive and specialized tool, you don&#039;t really want to wear out the spikes on rocks and the longer spikes might also be slippery on bare rock. They&#039;re really a tool for climbing steep, hard ice and glaciated peaks, they&#039;re also pretty dangerous both to yourself and any climbing parters in the case of a fall. At least in my experience, above the treeline on ridges the wins scours away most of the snow, leaving rocks covered in extremely slippery rime ice and snow pockets in the nooks between. In that kind of terrain snowshoes are more awkward and dangerous than helpful and microspikes are really the best tool for the job. For glaciated peaks in the alps, a lot of this probably goes right out the window though.",

If you talk to the rangers, they&#039;ll tell you not to try descending cathedral which is 100% correct, its absolutely brutal going up and uniquely unsafe to go down. There&#039;s a couple of cool boulder caves you can squeeze into on the trail though, when I was there the temperature inside the caves was cool enough to see my own breath even though it was in the 60&#039;s outside.",

If you go with other options/materials you&#039;re caught in a trap because most materials can&#039;t go up to a 4 inch brim before they sag and flop around.<br>The only way short brim would work ideally is with a brim that tilts down at the perfect angle to avoid blocking eyesight but long enough for coverage. These bucket hats don&#039;t exist though.<br>A baseball cap is 3 inches for the brim length and I&#039;ve determined that&#039;s the minimum you&#039;d want, but realistically 3 and a half or more is much better. Even baseball caps are too short in the length now as they&#039;ve adopted more sleek fits and looks. The German wool skip cap from ww2 is a good wide brim and the duckbill hats of old and some 1980s trucker hats have a good length.<br>The trick with a cloth hat holding it&#039;s shape is with a steel wire around the brim or foam in it.<br>For my job I currently use the Tilley airflo series. $$ but a lifetime guarantee.<br>If you want the more traditional option, get a felt hat. Akubras prob the best option. I think they use rabbit felt. Their sombrero model has a nice wide brim. You&#039;ll want to steam it though to shape it.",

It&#039;s so obvious when you do it, but somehow I never thought to do it:<br>You usually get one big bag with the tent, poles and stakes. Take the poles and stakes out of the bag, that way you don&#039;t need to worry about breaking something when you pack the (fairly bulky) tent as compact as you can in your pack. The poles and pegs are fairly light and small, so apart from making sure they don&#039;t get bent out of shape you can pack them wherever you like in your pack. I keep the poles along the spine of the backpack and the pegs in the top lid.<br>Also do a test pitch at home before you leave, just so you&#039;re somewhat familiar with how it&#039;s done for when you need it and don&#039;t need to look for a signal on your phone to download the manual or watch a video about it while it&#039;s raining cats and dogs.",

I&#039;d need a built in floor, and zipper bug screen doors on both ends. I like the idea of having the doors be recessed in with the ends becoming open vestibules. It seems like it would work really well and wouldn&#039;t require too much stitching and seam sealing. You&#039;d think a company could make something like this super cheap. Because of the &quot;always open airflow&quot; design I think you could make it out of siltarp and it would be pretty bombproof when it comes to rain in a wooded environment.",

I do the same shit where I create all these obstacles for myself that don&#039;t actually matter and then just end up feeling worse for not going. It helps to just be aware of when you start doing it, like thinking of the drive as an obstacle and then reframe that 2 hours is nothing to drive. Forcing yourself to go can break the cycle. Regardless of how bad I have felt before, I have only felt better for going and worse for not. Even just driving there, deciding you still don&#039;t want to hike and driving back will feel better than not going but chances are you probably will want to hike. You mentioned going alone, so I&#039;m assuming you struggle to find partners but for me the stress of letting someone down almost completely overrides anything keeping me from wanting to go.<br><br><a href=\"#p2806436\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2806436</a><br>You have definitely spent more time thinking about gear than using it.",

I also don&#039;t really give a fuck about what they do. I don&#039;t think i&#039;ve ever asked anyone what they do as i am often far too focused on what i am doing. Anyways a lot from what i overhear also do seasonal work where they&#039;ll hike 6 months then work 6 months which seems like a decent idea, hiking can be as cheap or as expensive as you want. I carry a bivy and put my backpack in a trash bag and don&#039;t use trekking poles, i meat all sorts of people some carrying 60 pounds with every new gadget and vice versa, just try not to get yourself in sticky situation where you want to look cool so you hangout with them and end up blowing 500 bucks in a day",

In the wrong direction, they just ended at an old rock slide, so I turned around and went back in the other direction and eventually I found a big clearing with a huge willow, and next to it is an old chapel with a broken off steeple. I do what any 16 year old would do and immediately drop my gear and head inside.<br>It&#039;s really boring, just a rotting empty room, but as soon as I stepped in I felt like I&#039;d just snuck into my parents&#039; room, it was really oppressing, and I kept like almost hearing footsteps next to me, so I just fucked out of there less than a minute later and started heading home.<br>A few days later I convinced my grandpa to come with me to see it, and we eventually got to the old road and headed north back to the old chapel, but when we got there, the only thing in the clearing was the big willow, there was nothing else, no debris or anything like if it collapsed. All we could find was what could have been part of a foundation, but there was a ton of blackberry bushes, so we gave up pretty quick. I got yelled at for wasting grandpa&#039;s time.<br>We found him in that clearing years later dead from a heart attack they said, just in his folding chair at his camp next to the big willow, facing the spot where the old foundation was.",

All normal camping shit.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;his gf goes to bed in tent, we stay up getting drunk and smoking cigs.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;run out of fire wood oh well, we grab some wood keep an insanely small fire until it goes out.</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;still have liter of wine we figure we\u2019ll kill it to make packing out easy. </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hear leaves rustling and twigs snapping </span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;turn our headlamps on and we see two weirdos in their early 20s.

We don\u2019t see them again </span><br><br>still have no idea wtf they were doing since the trail looped around and we didn\u2019t see them again. Which is really strange. Didn\u2019t realize how fucked up it was until the morning when we realized that they walked just straight into the woods with no light wearing regular street clothes. We assume they were walking to one of the cabins but the nearest one was like 2/3miles away and they would be walking on pretty rough terrain. <br><br>Maybe they had a canoe or some shit but also weird because we would have saw them earlier in the day when we were set up.",

Kept going, scanning for bears/cougars more intently as that&#039;s usually my subconscious alerting me to a real threat. In my extra scanning I noticed a path through the trees off the trail, didn&#039;t appear frequently trafficked as the duff was undisturbed, but the trees were missing enough for it to stick out. The dread I had been feeling entering this area had been replaced with alarms screaming in my head, but I had to see what was down there since I was planning on camping nearby. <br><br>Graveyard.<br>Not on the map.<br><br>Paid my respects by reading all the graves that were legible and wishing them well. When I returned to the trail the forest seemed friendlier and I took that as my sign that I was in the clear. <br><br>Researched it when I got home and it was a known graveyard, but just wasn&#039;t placed on the map for whatever reason.

        "com": "In the spring of 2022 a friend and I went hunting for bear in the Umpqua national forest outside of Tiller, OR. There remained a bit of snow maybe a foot or two and we ended up hiking to the top of a meadow, next to a spring. Waiting, I ended up losing my chance at a bear after waiting several hours when my friend ended up in a coughing fit and the bear that was a good distance away at the bottom of the meadow bolted. That part is irrelevant. We end up leaving shortly after because it was late, and by the time we were almost off of the trail it was sunset. We were maybe 200 yard from the trailhead when we encountered a couple who were just getting onto the trail. The man had nothing but a very small day pack, and the woman had nothing except a baby on baby carrier on her chest. They seemed extremely nervous and in my autism I assumed it was because of the hunting rifle slung over my shoulder. The man shakily asked how it was going and said it was going fine, just got done for the day. My friend and I kept walking and I realized it sounded like they weren&#039;t moving and I looked back and they were just staring at us. When we looked back they hurriedly kept walking down the trail, towards the east (we encountered them at a split that occurs .1 miles from the trailhead. When we got to the trailhead the only other vehicle besides our own was a blue Toyota FJ cruiser with Idaho license plates. The car was completely empty. We drove off and it really didn&#039;t set in how weird the interaction was until a half hour down the dirt roads, how strange it is they were getting on a snow covered trail right at sunset when the closest town, Tiller (which is only a couple of buildings) was nearly an hour of driving away. They didn&#039;t even seem equipped at all to camp over night. I don&#039;t know still what was going on with that, if those people are still alive or not.<br><br>Pic related, it&#039;s that area in the fall",

I wake up at 3 am to piss and when I get out of my tent the dude is just hovering near my campsite. He looked strung the fuck out. I said something like &quot;Can I help you dude?&quot; and he asked &quot;is there anyone with you?&quot; At that point I noticed he had something in his hand. He was kind of trying to hide it in his sleeve and I didn&#039;t get a good luck but i&#039;m pretty sure it was a knife. At that point I very firmly said &quot;You gotta get out of here.&quot;<br><br>Then he really freaked me out. Have you ever seen those videos of Charles Manson in court where he starts making these weird faces? Like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9Q<wbr>XY80OxS0<br><br>The guy started doing that. It&#039;s so unnerving to see a deranged person be &quot;silly.&quot; Like it would have been less scary if he had screamed or said he was going to kill me or something. He just made faces at me and started doing weird little voices. It was so fucking bizarre. I&#039;d just never seen real schizophrenia like that before.<br><br>I told him fuck off again and he finally did. But I definitely wasn&#039;t about to get back in my tent. I ended up getting the fire going again and just waiting up all night for the sun to rise.<br><br>A few months later I found out a lot of other people had encounters with this guy. I&#039;m glad he&#039;s in custody now. I&#039;m sure he&#039;ll be out soon though seeing as how this is California.",

A girl explained that they were part of a church and they would come out to that spot for night hiking. They setup a small camp right next to me and started making food and praying for a long time. Basically a whole mass. It really weirded me out because why the fuck would they not go somewhere else out in the whole woods and do that. A few of the people came over and started asking me about my faith and offering me to come to their church for service. They stayed for like two hours and then just left after.",

        "com": "My wife and I were dating at the time and we were invited to go camping at Bluewater (NM) with her family, a group of about 10 people. We set everything up just off the shore of the lake and another group of friendly people but strangers, about the same size, was camped a little ways down the shore. I felt a weird vibe from the whole area during the day but brushed it off. My wife and I are not drinkers so we were sober at night when shit went down. Our group and the other group were each doing their own thing at night, mostly playing card games, eating and having some drinks. We kept hearing what sounded like a little girl, whining. The youngest person in our group was my wife\u2019s 18 year old little brother, but we assumed the little girl must be in the other group. The whining did sound a bit distressed like asking for help. It got worse and worse and eventually someone from that group came over to ask if there was a little girl with us because it sounded like she needed help. Nope. Both groups full of adults. So with the other group we gather flashlights and start searching the area, thinking there\u2019s a little girl somehow out here who\u2019s lost, scared and confused and needing help. There\u2019s a field of grass between the lake and the forest, the little girl sounds were very loud, and we quickly found the source. In the grass field in front of the forest we all saw the same shit. This tall thing, taller than anyone in our groups, it was skinny and completely white. Head to toe, it was WHITE. I couldn\u2019t make out features or clothes, I described it as well as I could, but as soon as we saw it and were watching it, the little girl noises continued like crying for help and 100% from that thing. Everyone was quiet. We all looked at each other but being in such a large group felt safe to advance a bit and check it out.",

It seemed like it was still facing us just backing away as we approached. When it got into the forest we lost sight of it and couldn\u2019t hear a little girl anymore. Both groups discussed amongst each other how weird and honestly creepy it was, before mutually agreeing to keep an eye out for the rest of the night. The vibe was weird after that, nobody felt like playing games or drinking and it was late enough to go to bed, so everyone went to their tent for the night. I wanted to leave, but felt safe with my wife and her brothers in the tent we were in and didn\u2019t want her family to think negatively of me for leaving. I couldn\u2019t sleep at all that night and neither could the guys in the tent with me. Later at night around 2AM we heard it again, same exact noises, in that field behind us. We refused to leave the tent and left to get back to the city immediately the next morning. I have never in my life witnessed anything that compares. Sometimes the topic comes up with her family and it still creeps all of us out. Not one person who was there that night can explain what we all saw and heard.",

There is one called Dog island and one called Scrub Island which has an airstrip for drug smuggling built in the 80s <br><br>The other island is called Prickly Pear, often tourists will go there to party, for day trips, most people don&#039;t stay overnight. <br><br>There is a small structure right off the main leeward side beach, with some built in benches and chairs, a built in bar and snack shack, all open. Also an abandoned metal boat on the windward side of the island<br><br>I went to sailing school for a few years, I did scuba diving for shipwrecks and other reefs, long story short I was a very /out/ person, fishing often.<br><br>When I was about 13, I decided to take my small sailing boat to camp on prickly pear overnight, The whole day was fun, caught and cooked a couple red snappers over an open fire, explored the beech with my metal detector. At night time I usually would have slept in a hammock outside between two coconut palms however I had a really weird feeling like I was being watched and decided to sleep inside the shack, It had a doorway and a counter with a small opening, so it had some shelter to it. <br><br>Starting at around midnight I could hear a lot of excessive splashing and laughing, it sounded like a young female voice; I was weirdly scared/excited but next thing I know it started to call my name, to come in the water. I was so scared I thought my heart was going to come out of my chest, I didn&#039;t even get up to look, stayed alert as long as i could until I eventually fell asleep and sailed home the next day. <br><br>I asked some old islander sailors and fishermen who said they would have made me disappear if I had gone out.",

I&#039;m pretty new to climbing outdoors but I expect it varies a lot depending on who you&#039;re climbing with and local culture. If your intro to climbing is some commercial outfit then there&#039;s probably a safety discussion beforehand. For me it&#039;s been more like &quot;this one goes up there, then there, then it&#039;s a bit run-out there so watch yourself, then it&#039;s pretty cruisy &#039;til the end&quot; and &quot;that&#039;s why you don&#039;t forget your helmet&quot; (after narrowly avoiding braining myself when a big chunk came away in my hand). <br><br>You might get a kick out of this video.

What happens is the small rope wraps around the big rope and they&#039;re hard to separate because of the carabiner attaching them. I think it would be better to not have the biner clipped to the big rope. That said, the clove would be better suited since it&#039;s just a biner block at that point. The clove really can&#039;t move around the biner after it&#039;s tightened. What I would do is tension the rappel a lot before you unclip your tether, so you can be sure that clove is set tight, and that will give you confidence as you descend.

Stacking new towers and painting jobs are just construction jobs in the vertical axis. Wireless ISPs add in a little more technical skill (microwave/ip). <br>Most radio shops (LMR or broadcast) don&#039;t do tower work - they hire it out. Those contractors don&#039;t do any of the tech stuff, they&#039;re just &quot;put antenna on tower&quot; and the radio shop does the technical stuff like line sweeps, equipment installation/testing.<br><br>Get your tower cert, basic climbing and safety, usually 2+ days. Rigging is a good skill to know too, especially if you&#039;re doing bigger hauls (heavier cell antennas, dishes, tower sections). Rope Access SPRAT/IRATA will open a bunch of doors to you, both in RA and tower work. First Aid/CPR and OSHA10/30 also good ones to have if you&#039;re looking to move into foreman/supervisor roles.<br><br>Might get some snowcat/atv vehicle training if your company has and uses those. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is it dumb to get into that work?</span><br>It&#039;s a small niche industry so there isn&#039;t a ton of demand for it, but it&#039;s also an industry that many other industries depend on. I do quite a bit of public safety work, cops and firefighters rely on their radios, so there&#039;s always going to be work there if you know what you&#039;re doing.<br><br>Some companies are better than others. There&#039;s a lot of cowboy companies out there that don&#039;t train their guys to do things right, and your career options there hurt because of it. They&#039;re just out there trying to make payroll, lowest-bidder companies. Other ones train and take care of their guys, those are the ones you want to work for. <br><br>I&#039;ve made a decent living in it, but i&#039;m not &quot;just&quot; a tower guy either.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I fucking hate climbing monopoles.</span>",

It&#039;s true some people are very predisposed to being fearless but tend to also be careless climbers that eventually injure themselves and chill out. Keep in mind that most climbers are nervous about what they are doing, it really is just a mixture of experience, emotional stability, and maybe retardation that allows climbers to climb hard sketchy routes.

I&#039;m assuming you want a spinning reel? you can probably find the Penn Battle 3 on sale for well under $90 since the 4 has been out a while now. all aluminum and sealed bearings. look for 2500 size. shimano nasci is another choice right at the $100 mark since they just came out with a new 2025 version, you might find old stock for cheaper. will be much smoother than the penn but it&#039;s not all aluminum. not that it will be fragile. then just get the two piece daiwa aird-x or something. model AIRX662MFS or AIRX702MFS. I haven&#039;t used enough 2 piece rods to recommend any others, and you&#039;re limited anyways. try some 8lb yo-zuri hybrid line for added sensitivity due to low stretch. it&#039;s more like 10lb strength anyways. if you went the baitcaster route, you could get more bang for your buck but there is a learning curve.",

I&#039;ve wanted to try the Simms Zip-it Flats shoe, but I&#039;ve seen a couple negative reviews, and I am dubious of their performance in non-salt environments, i.e. places with gravel, steep banks, and lots of walking.<br>You could also take the approach of total acceptance, that sand and gravel is an inevitable and perpetual irritant.

Takes a canteen, a sawyer for refilling, a pack of food (jerky, granola or whatever), a camping stove, a canteen cup w/ lid, and eating utensils. That pouch and the stuff in my pants pockets is enough to stay comfy for up to 36 hours, easily.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;jungle bag</span><br>I fucking hate that thing. The retarded &quot;join your bag with that of your girlfriend (who absolutely exists...)&quot; feature means that there&#039;s a gap at the bottom that&#039;s wide enough to stick your arm through. Defeats the entire purpose of having a &quot;jungle bag&quot; with netting, that&#039;s supposed to keep spiders, snakes and other creepers away from you. If you have to bring a tent anyways, you might as well just use a cheap chinesium summer bag.<br>If you want an actual jungle bag, either get the original UK issue one (which is cotton though, iirc), or the Carinthia Tropen.",

Oh, and it was cheap on sale.<br>The red light is super handy for tent use, getting up to piss, or for extra visibility in winter when I&#039;m walking the dog along the road shoulder in the dark season.",

Then I grew up a little, graduated from minimum wage, met some people with some hobbies that were actually expensive, and realized I was being a retard. A basic set of climbing gear can be had for less than a $1000. Alpine climbing, ice climbing, mountaineering gear will cost another couple thousand. Maybe $5k if you want to be an all around mountain athlete. Less if you look for deals and buy used gear, more if you want brand new arcteryx clothing to go with your whole kit. Compared to many other sports, mountain sports are cheap.",

Some over 100 miles.<br>I got lost in the woods following trails. Which was fun but I didn&#039;t actually get to where I was trying to get to.<br>Though the happy mistake was that I just found some really nice long trails that i could follow on some long hikes. Week(s) long hikes too.<br>The issue is the water source (old roman spring) that was near enough that was only a few hours walk from where I used to camp, is gone. Fuck knows what they did with it.<br>Near it there is a small stream or brook but i cannot tell if this water is safe to drink. Though it is besides the point anyway as its only at the first entrance to the woods and following the trail I want to do as a first text hike is 35 miles.<br>So what can I do about water?<br><br>I am thinking of doing a test run on the 35 mile hike next month, but this is gonna be in summer, I am gonna probably need 2-3 litres of water each day for drinking, then some for bathing and cooking. Maybe total even 4-5 litres a day depending how hot it is.<br>Plus I wanted to hike back, so a 70 mile round trip. Give or take 7 days as I will be wild camping in between, seeing scenery and enjoying the raw woodland.<br>Something like 35 litres of water is too heavy weight to carry.<br><br>So WTF do I do about water source?<br>Any anons who has experience with long hikes like that, or even longer. How do you deal with no water source?",

Don&#039;t fuck around with being isolated without water. It&#039;s a misery you&#039;ll never want to know, way worse than carrying a heavy load.",

Would it be the end of the world if the experienced but slow hiker were in the back of the group and could go at his own comfortable pace? The way I see it, the &quot;slowest hiker in the group sets the pace&quot; mantra only applies to inexperienced hikers who could get in serious trouble if he/she were separated from the pack.

I don&#039;t know how widely available the guns are but if you&#039;ve not got much you might be able to DIY something?",

How do you tell how much light your plants get and when you should water them? I have 4 succulents: A small pickle plant, trigona rubra, something related to a trigona rubra that I forget the name of, and a dancing bones cactus that I think might have suffered being in a pot with no drainage from when I bought it and is slowly recovering from root rot.. I have them put up at a south-western window that appears to get high light and medium light depending on the time of day. Should I buy grow lights on them or grow them somewhere else and put a different plant there? I have them in my office/bedroom/living room next to a typical sized window that&#039;s pretty tiny. I have drainage holes in all of them too, but I&#039;m worried about either overwatering them and the fact I keep losing soil everytime I water them because it keeps falling through the drainage holes. I live in central eastern US coast so I get a mix of extremely hot days to cold snowy winters. Should I invest in growlight anything so my plants survive the winter? The pickle plant appears to already be growing toward the window at times.",

I did 4 rows in a 32 inch bed. Ammend/compost bed and plant in fall, I planted in mid October then mulch over, I use shredded oak leaves because that\u2019s what I have. Harvest when the bottom 3 leaves start to brown and die back for me thats late June. Cure for 2-4 weeks in a shaded area with airflow. (Get a better cure setup than me.) When growing hardneck garlic prune the scapes and eat them. I\u2019ll set aside 15-20 of the biggest bulbs here to breakdown and replant in October. At roughly 8 cloves a bulb and setting aside 15-20 to replant it comes out to 2 or so cloves of garlic a day for a year.(120-130 garlic bulbs) Scale up or down for your needs. Since im not filling an entire bed with garlic im going to do overwintered onions with my garlic when I plant again in fall.",

I always start taking off the lower leaves when the flowers are finished with blooming and the smaller tomatoes start getting bigger on to lowest truss of tomatoes. After that I take off some leaves every week or 2 and work my way to the top once the other trusses with tomatoes get bigger. I also take away all the leaves that touch the ground to prevent disease. <br><br>I also take away the suckers every week when I see them, I tie op the tomatoes with cord at the same time. The tops I take off when they touch the top of my greenhouse or end of july (what comes first.)",

They either fall off on their own or break off if I gently touch them and it is only a few leaves and flowers at a time that seem susceptible. There are no insect issues and the leaves are healthy (perky with no deformaties or signs of nutrient stress). I used coffee grounds as fertilizer twice as the only added nutrients other than the initial potting soil but this issue was happening before then. I figured it was due to underwatering as I was giving them heavy watering after letting them dry down for multiple days but I&#039;ve changed the watering cycle to be less water more often. The issue still hasn&#039;t changed. The stem is starting to get bare from the lack of leaves and all the flowers fall off when they start fruiting so no fruit yet either. Do you have any ideas as to what is causing this?",

You will need a lighter or match, and something to tamp it with--a large nail works well if you don&#039;t have a pipe tool. Fill the pipe with tobacco, pack it down halfway, top it off, pack it down to 3/4, top it off again, pack gently and enjoy. Smoke slower than you think you need to, the tobacco tastes best when it is burning cool. Tamp and re-light as needed. If you still have trouble, try different methods on YouTube until you find one that works for you.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;smoking a pipe will give you cancer</span><br>Originally the Surgeon General found that pipe and cigar smokers, following a careful study of the statistics (at a time when most adults smoked, so they had a good sample size), had insignificant death rate increases. Nowadays, tobacco is being legislated against while hard drugs are being legalized. Put two and two together.

Google AI says only 15% of cigarette smokers get lung cancer. Pipe and cigar smokers basically don&#039;t get any cancer. It&#039;s very rare. I hate the FDA so much, they made it illegal for pipe shops to make their own house blends and prevented tobacco producers from doing their annual Christmas blends. If you make any new blend it has to be studied by the FDA for safety and it costs tens of thousands of dollars.<br><br>I wouldn&#039;t recommend Captain Black, it has a chemical smell and flavor. Half and Half is really good. pipesandcigars.com is my go to for tobacco purchases because my state lost it&#039;s last pipe shop. I recommend Lane 1-Q for a vanilla flavor over Captain Black. I also recommend Cult Blood Red Moon for a strong cherry flavor.

Well, supposedly the match was just the bulk version of WhiteKnight and used slightly lower grade tobacco, but I doubt WhiteKnight still uses Sutliff tobacco, unless Russ Ouellette stalked up on Sutliff blending tobacco beforehand.<br><br>If you want something in the same genre (though 100% not the same, nor as good, as the Sobranie Match), Arango Balkan Supreme is a really good bulk Balkan blend. It\u2019s spicier and zestier than the Sobranie Match and less sweet and smoky.",

I&#039;ve been enjoying MATCH Carter Hall lately, which is very cheap, actually tastes like tobacco, and also has some little sweet chocolatey notes in it. I would say it&#039;s a pretty &quot;standard&quot; pipe tobacco to start on, for both a prior smoker and someone who has no experience, because if you haven&#039;t smoked before, it will give you an experience that is lightly flavored while still tasting like tobacco, and if you have smoked before, you&#039;ll get actual tobacco with a little flavor. I liked MATCH Prince Albert more, but that seems to no longer be available. Besides, that, maybe just order a few 1oz samplers if you can afford it or things that sound good or that you think you might like. I myself really like Perique and Burley, but I&#039;ve been laying off the heavier blends while it&#039;s 100 degrees outside. <br><br>You should eventually try to figure out how much you like Virginia, Burley, Perique, and Latakia (and Deertongue) so that you can approximate whether or not you might like a blend based on its components. <br><br><a href=\"#p2830021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2830021</a><br>What it tastes like really depends on the tobacco. If everything seems like its lit, you&#039;re doing it right. If everything is mostly staying lit, you&#039;re doing it right, though this can also vary depending on the tobacco. If the pipe bowl is getting warm to the touch, you&#039;re doing it right, but maybe consider slowing down; non-aromatic tobaccos, I tend to smoke a bit hot but I find that a pipe will never get as hot with a non-aromatic as it will with an aromatic, and I tend to smoke aromatics a bit cooler because if you smoke them faster everything turns into hot air rather than flavor, so you kinda need to smoke them cool, but the pipe still might get hot even while smoking them cool depending on the pipe. If you are smoking an aromatic and all you taste is &quot;warm air&quot;, you&#039;re smoking too fast.",

Mechanically what is happening, and you can choose to smoke this way if you want, is that basically your tongue is acting as a diaphragm and is creating a vacuum that &quot;smokes&quot; the pipe for you without you needing to actually draw from the stem. You then very, very, very gently &quot;massage&quot; the smoke back out through the pipe, mouth closed, and you do this slowly, and this is the &quot;breath method&quot; or smoking. The benefits of it is that you probably wont really need to worry about relights until maybe the very end of the bowl, and also generally going this slowly allows you to taste the tobacco better.",

I always find myself fiddling around to get the inner nice and taught. <br>*There a gap between the fly and the ground which drafts can come in. This is especially noticeable from the front.<br>*The fly stretches due to rain, and condensation from the fly and touch the inner and come through.<br>*Included pegs are rubbish, I replaced them with titanium stakes and easton stakes.<br><br>As for the Cloud UP 1, are you choosing it because you want a tent that holds up in high winds?

I cannot get the fabric inner as tight as the mesh inner, and in winter my breath condenses on the inner fabric causing it to get damp and sag towards me, but I have not gotten my sleeping bag wet so far. The Lanshan 1 has good floor space for gear, and I specifically got the Plus version over the Pro version (which has more interior space) so I could get a 4 season inner for year round use, and not have to deal with condensation. The downside of these pyramid style tents is the angled sides give you less interior space, but I never had issues with my shoulders touching the sides of the tent while sleeping.",

The valve not standard, however I can still inflate it with my Flextail TinyX pump using the flexible adapter, pushing it inside the lip of valve, but it needs to be topped off with the pump sack to get it to the right firmness. When properly inflated there is no crinkling. This pad looks exactly like the &quot;Hikenture R6.0&quot; pad, but has similar construction and baffling to a Nemo sleep mat. The vertical baffles help keep you from slipping of the mat. The two pieces of foil insulation extend the entire width, and length so no cold spots. I asked the seller for the ASTM report, which said the pad the R valve was 4.7, and I think it is accurate as it kept me warm at -1C. Total weight of 630 grams.",

On earlier seasons one big animal and you\u2019ve basically won the whole thing so it\u2019s way more logical to try for one until you lose than try and outlast the others in a starvation contest. Why live off of fish and destroy your body for months only to place 2nd or third when you can either win it all or go home after a couple weeks with your body still healthy? I assume there\u2019s some hidden \u201cyou get paid X each day you\u2019re out there\u201d clause in the contract or everyone would just do this unless they\u2019re retarded.",

Where I&#039;m at the legal minimum bow for hunting whitetail deer is 45 lbs draw weight. They don&#039;t base it on KE, just on draw weight, but since in traditional archery with cedar arrows and a double bladed broadhead the weight of the arrow needed to fly straight goes up proportionally with the draw weight of the bow, so restrictions based on draw weight are a good enough proxy for a minimum. Pretty much any other type of setup will outpenetrate a wooden bow shooting wooden arrows, but if you can&#039;t pull 40-45 lbs then you probably should stick to gonnes.",

And it\u2019s a little expensive if you really want a good set up, considering the cost of quilts. <br><br>But the comfort is unmatched. I have a ground setup as well, with a Nemo Tensor pad (3.5\u201d thick), and it\u2019s not even close. I just straight up sleep better in the hammock.<br><br>Everything is a give and take. Hammocks allow for more campsite options in some environments because you don\u2019t have to worry about ground conditions. I\u2019ve hung my hammocks in some truly janky spots, even somewhat steep hills (not precariously dangerous, just too steep for lying down). When hammocking I\u2019m much more likely to sit under my shelter than I am with a tent. It\u2019s a really comfortable chair while a tent is just shelter from bugs and weather. In rainy weather it\u2019s actually nice to be able to chill out under a tarp rather than enclosed in a tent. Hammock systems are also oftentimes unique, with people using different tarps, hammocks, and suspension systems. Theyre the king on hot nights, when a tent is too stuffy and warm. Hammocks are much better ventilated as well.<br><br>There are downsides. Upfront cost is a big one. The hammock and tarp might be cheaper or about the same as an equivalent tent, but the real kicker is insulation. You\u2019ll need an underquilt, and that\u2019s crazy expensive ($300+). You could go cheap with synthetic but that\u2019s a massive weight penalty. There\u2019s a learning curve to setting up, and figuring out what works for you. I like my foot end about 12\u201d higher than my head (it keeps me from \u201csliding down\u201d). Even after you know what works there\u2019s still some fiddling. Deploying and hanging is quicker than a tent but you\u2019ll have to get out and adjust a little, move this up, move that down, slide that thing over\u2026 It\u2019s never perfect on the first try. Wind can be an issue because the tarps are just so damn big, but that\u2019s more of a skill issue.",

That&#039;s the nice thing if you&#039;re fucking loaded, there&#039;s always someone willing to cater to your needs and whims if you&#039;re willing to pay.<br>Research and talk to the outfitters about the hunting experience you want, and I&#039;m sure you can agree on something.<br>I read a hunting trip report from someone who went up into some *stan country to hunt Marco Polo sheep, and that wasn&#039;t one bloody bit glamorous by the sounds of it. Hiking long treks in difficult mountain terrain after some tiny hardened brown men who subsisted on butter and thin tea and set a murderous pace every day, long shots under difficult conditions if a shot presented itself, sleeping in drafty shepherd huts with only a meagre dung fire for warmth.<br>Both expensive and challenging, then.<br>If you&#039;re hunting on a game reserve, they might be teeming with game, but some of them are fucking huge. Selous Game Reserve is twice the size of Denmark. Of course you&#039;d be wanting a car to get around there if the kind of animal you&#039;re hunting has appeared, but you still have to follow those very skilled trackers up to the animal. Look at the ranges they shoot elephants at, it&#039;s positively mind-boggling.<br>You can hunt a big variety of game too, not only big game. Getting a nice trophy animal can be very costly, but things like warthog, plains game (like antilopes) or tuskless elephants are well within reach for a middle class man with a bit of prioritising. If you&#039;re in it for the sport, you could try bow hunting, where you have to get proper close up.<br>I know a guy, regular old electrician, who went on a driven boar hunt in Hungary. Not off-puttingly expensive, and he said it was a great experience, very different from the regular moose hunt, and certainly nothing for amateurs, since the boars came positively racing through the forest.",

        "com": "*view the thrust number on a trolling motor as torque instead of horsepower. or you could also view it similarly to a gear ratio I guess. there is very little top speed gain under comparible conditions in the same boat. for example, a 30lb thrust motor might go about 0.25mph slower than a 50lb thrust motor. the &quot;thrust&quot; is essentially the push so of course higher thrust will be &quot;faster&quot; or &quot;better&quot; against current/wind. adding weight to a boat lowers the water line and this more resistance, so that&#039;s why they suggest more thrust for heavier vessels. you take a noticeable power consumption hit though when going up in thrust. it&#039;s even good to learn the power draw for each speed on your trolling motor. if I remember correctly as an example, on a minn kota 30lb(the smallest one) the top(5th speed) is nearly double the power draw of the 4th speed. significant power savings and thus range by never using the top speed. however, in some current/wind conditions you have to weigh if you favor the extra grunt over range deoending on your outing. hull shape determines a lot of the efficiency also. a cheap minn kota 30lb trolling motor will move evern a large canoe very well, even with a couple hundred pounds of payload, you will only really notice a more powerful motor&#039;s benefite in current/wind. there is definitely a point of diminishing returns though. tldr: if you have money and can afford a large battery, get a powerful motor, but don&#039;t expect better top speed. you&#039;re lucky to get 3.5-4mph. if you care about being weight concious, smaller motors are lighter and don&#039;t require as big of a battery for the same range. also, buy LiFePO4. there is no reason not to with how cheap they are now. way lighter than acid batteries and you don&#039;t get the bad power curve like an acid battery the lower your state of charge drops.",

Make sure you pack enough food cause we fucked up and ran the 1st day mostly on beer and snacks, with a full dinner at the very end of the day and a full breakfast the next. I think kayaking is easier than the rubber boats we used since kayaks are lighter.

Also basically all the woodwork needs replacing, gunwales basically already gone, I have the seat but it&#039;s broken, and the yoke is barely hanging on.<br><br>What the best course of action? It&#039;s fragile without gunwales obviously, but I&#039;d rather paint before attaching new ones if possible. Thinking wash and sand down the chips, crack, and gelcoat cracks, patch the crack both sides, then get some thickened epoxy putty to fill in the chips and gelcoat racks (after sanding/grinding them down), prime, paint, then woodwork?<br><br>As far as wood, was thinking of doing cherry. I know ash is the usual recommendation but cherry is about the same price and I think looks nicer for the canoe (it&#039;s orange and I&#039;m going to keep it the same color). Original wood was apparently Parana pine. Is a table saw enough to rip boards? I&#039;m going to be scarfing them also, no long wood readily available near me (even though it&#039;s just under 14&#039; but still). Also going to try to cut out a shelf into the outwale to cover the fiberglass, not sure how difficult that&#039;s gonna be.... Also do I have to drill new holes in the fiberglass when attaching the gunwales, or can I re-use the old ones? If I need new ones, do I need to fiberglass the old ones? Don&#039;t want to end up creating a perforated tear line lol.<br><br>As far as the seat since I have the old one, just going to do my best to produce a close copy, it&#039;s fairly basic, sorta trapezoid that had premade cane webbing.<br><br>Any tips?

So I am seriously considering it especially for a first project.<br>One other thing that I find gives the Oz Goose an edge is how it&#039;s built a lot by many people across the world, it has more than proven itself I think.<br><br>Honesty the pram does look very charming and suitable for what I want (light cruising on inland waters) I think building an Oz Goose may actually be a better starting point.<br>I need more time to think it through, and consider how much I want to spend on quality materials or see if I can build a super cheap rig.<br>Thanks again.",

It is plastic which I don&#039;t like, and I plan to eventually get a high quality wooden canoe built like that company in Maine who does it, though they have a 2 year waitlist. I have a small bass-tracker style boat but more often I prefer the slipping stealth offered by a canoe and the thrill of fighting bass from it, especially if I happen to hook one un-anchored. <br>Recently I went on a trip to Guntersville Lake in Alabama and fished morning and evening for 5 days in the canoe. I have a flag that I fly on the boat when crossing the channels for visibility (southern flag that makes tards rage), and I had a couple days where the wind was strong enough that on crossing the channel going back to camp I only had to fly the flag and I got decent speed like a sailboat. It was a ton of fun. This has made me start to consider actually installing a mast on my canoe and learning to sail when the wind is favorable. <br>I would probably want outboard stabilizers if I did this, right? There&#039;s a few videos online of people with this setup. For a while I played with the idea of having the option of a 5hp outboard motor on the stern (it is not square-stern so it would be side-mounted) but I think if I make any modification it will be a mast for coolness. Of course I could do both and have either option I want. <br>https://www.wooden-canoes.com/canoe<wbr>s/",

Though I&#039;ve seen people do canoe sailing without that, but if you&#039;ve never done canoe sailing it may be wise to rig something up to add stability.<br><br>Also, it depends a lot on what kind of performance you want out of it, you can add a really big sail to go fast, you would really need the extra stability. or if you just want to do some light cruising, maybe you can get by with just a small sail and no outrigger. <br>Heck you can also do without rudder and leeboard if your sail is particularly small and just use the paddle for steering. I guess it all comes down to how much you want to push your canoe.",

Most recently I went to the UK for a month and went with the heavier set up since i assumed there would be less trees and I would be more comfortable in a tent. I always find that it\u2019s better to carry more than you need then carry ultra light since you\u2019re inevitably going to end up breaking something and will have a very uncomfortable night. Then again I\u2019ve got a good friend who has the same set up as I mentioned at first and he\u2019s been using that for years with no problems so hike your hike I guess",

There&#039;s certain things they&#039;d have that wouldn&#039;t be relevant to campers like shaving cream and razors since they needed to look presentable when looking for jobs, but they were very practically minded travelers. of course, they mostly traveled by rail, but they had to do a lot of walking.<br><br>If you want to do cowboy style camping, keep in mind that cowboys would be riding around with a horse to carry more gear. They could afford more conveniences like pots and pans and tents that would be too much for a hobo to fuss with. They were still practically minded but they were set up well to go deep into the wilderness whereas hobos stayed close to civilization and hobo jungles, and were able to make do with less on them. Not saying you need a horse, but an ATV can carry about the same amount of gear and supplies without going full on car camping. Unfortunately the trade off is that they&#039;re noisy as fuck, but it&#039;s up to you if that&#039;s a problem or not. Stealth camping is a whole other category.",

It&#039;s not cheap but it&#039;s for bushcraft so it definitely fits the bill of both being retro and practical, and it&#039;s designed for work. The downside is it&#039;s not all leather although the canvas is at least still oldschool.<br><br>https://www.99percenthandmade.com/p<wbr>roducts/copy-of-24-hours-tested-bac<wbr>kpack-50l-custom-leather-canvas-bus<wbr>hcraft-backpack-camping-backpack-bu<wbr>shcraft-camping-hiking-bag-rucksack<wbr>-1<br><br>I would say just be careful that you know how big the pack actually is. Sometimes companies will try and sell you a pack based on how big of a laptop computer it can hold and not give a liter measurement, and they&#039;ll use small models to make it look bigger. I wouldn&#039;t want something smaller than 40 liters if it&#039;s going to be for an overnight trip and it&#039;s all I&#039;m taking. 15-20 liters is a day pack suitable for hiking but you&#039;re not going to fit a sleep roll and tarp in there and still have room for gear and supplies. If it&#039;s less than 15 liters it&#039;s a computer bag.",

The extra clothes I brought weren\u2019t very helpful, and my blanket was very insufficient.

I also immediately understand the utility of a small purse or pilgrims bag. <br><br>The shoes were the real MVP of the trip - I was nervous about how my feet would hold up without any padding in my soles, and about slipping without any traction, but neither were a big deal, I just ended up walking a little different and it was fine. <br><br>Overall: I made it, but I froze my ass off and it was very uncomfortable 4/10 - will update kit and try again soon.",

Sleeping on the streets in Minneapolis Minnesota from early spring to late fall. Crashed on my buddies couch in their apartment during the winter for a place to stay. My first 2 days in I stashed the pack I was carrying around because it was too heavy. Sometimes you just want that weight off your shoulders and to not look visibly homeless for a couple hours. Pack ended up getting stolen. Easily $600 dollars worth of gear gone including helikon tex Alice, hygiene, water filter, sleeping bag, ect. Literally everything. Now my pack never leaves my side.<br>For camping out I would usually set up my tarp down by the river in a wooded area or a local park. Sometimes if the weather was permitting I would simply sleep on a park bench. This is actually quite comfortable. I carry a gun, knife and mace on me so I normally felt safe no matter where I was staying. Always have something to protect yourself with. <br>I never worried about having a camp stove because in Minneapolis you can get 3 free meals a day from charity organizations. Buying food and cooking it is pretty redundant at that point. Same with water filter. Water is plentiful in large cities.<br>For maps I use Osmand. It&#039;s completely offline. Has useful features like the ability to mark and find the nearest water fountain or bathroom near you, super helpful if you&#039;re homeless. It also has a lot of trails you won&#039;t find on Google maps. The best part is it has offline navigation.",

Belle Isle Zoo before the state took over management of Belle Isle was always very cool. I hear it\u2019s not smart to go there anymore because of all the jackbooted statie thugs patrolling everywhere. No idea what the condition of the boardwalks and holding pens are now. Back in 2012 it was already crumbling. If I were to try to visit them again, I\u2019d use the canals. There\u2019s a route through the canals that wind through belle isle that runs right next to the fence of the zoo. It\u2019d be pretty easy to paddle there and then slip in while avoiding the panoptic gaze of the state.<br><br>The Brewster Douglass projects were also fun to explore. They were once 4, 32 story abandoned apartment towers right across I96 from downtown. They were demolished in like 2014 but the rec center is still there (and tightly guarded) and had some spooky places like the locker rooms, pool, and basketball court. It was probably pretty nice back in the day and it\u2019s sad most communities don\u2019t really have stuff like that anymore. Some interesting famous people had connections to those projects. Diana Ross of the Supremes grew up in the nearby townhomes that were part of the Brewster projects, all members of the Temptations grew up in the towers, and Muhammad Ali trained at the boxing ring in the basement of the rec center. I can find my old photos and share some if there\u2019s interest. <br><br>As for gloves, mechanix work gloves are goated.",

Tons of different clothes, a medicine cabinet, you get the picture.

If you want to saw something, use a saw. I&#039;ve never found a saw blade on a knife to be useful for sawing. It&#039;s always been slow cumbersome and just fucking annoying honestly. You can find some very good folding saws that are light and don&#039;t take up much space. If you want to dig a hole use a shovel. Using a knife to dig a hole should be an emergency use only. Knives are terrible shovels and you risk damaging your blade. Unless you&#039;re backpacking and trying to cut weight, just bring a &quot;military&quot; style folding shovel/pick. If you&#039;re backpacking, get a spade. You can find spades that have blades and saws, but they&#039;re not useful in my experience. If you want to split wood use a hatchet. Again, unless you&#039;re trying to save ounces for a multiday hike, just get a good hatchet. Knives aren&#039;t good at splitting, they&#039;re not designed to be used this way and you WILL damage your knife if you use it this way. Unless you&#039;re planning on being in a situation where you&#039;ll need to split wood, this shouldn&#039;t even be a consideration.",

With every pass of the stone only a small percentage of the bevel is actually being ground. The wider the bevel, the longer it takes to sharpen and the more that can go wrong. For wilderness knives that will be sharpened primarily with small pocket stones you want the narrowest bevel possible. This requires a steeper angle on a shallower grind. ESEE is a good example of this, flat grind that cuts very well abruptly terminating in a very narrow 20 degree secondary bevel that is easily kept in shape with the most minimalistic sharpening equipment. Large chips can be ground out almost instantly with a small file. Scandi grind is a specialized carving geometry that is more suitable for professional use in a workshop.",

The further north you go the more common these conditions are, but even in east Tennessee or western North Carolina there is a good chance you&#039;re going to be staying awake all night rather than sleeping by a fire if you lack basic tools.

I use my Strongarm all the time outside and around the house. It&#039;s too big to carry in your back pocket but it&#039;s sturdy enough to use for just about anything. Just this morning I used it to stab through cold ground and pry up pavers that I was pouring river rocks below in order to level. When it&#039;s sharp I use it to cut fruit on the trail, or use it to smash ice in a cooler etc etc it&#039;s useful for anything that can be solved by smashing, cutting, or stabbing basically. Definitely the most used knife I have ever owned. It&#039;s just slightly too big to carry but I have it in my car or pack all the time. I don&#039;t intend to get stranded in the woods but given how constantly useful it is I would absolutely consider it a survival knife. Sometimes I wish it was longer for certain cutting tasks or had a thinner blade for turning screws and cutting food but then it wouldn&#039;t be as portable or durable. 10/10 honestly.",

An experienced person may make different choices, but no one would *need* anything more and could do everything they might need to do with a knife.<br><br>My only caveat is that you specifically say old SRK - the old SRKs had saber grinds, while the new standard SRKs are hollow grinds. I think a new SRK-C might be a little better than a new SRK because the compact version has a flat saber grind. The 3v versions of both knives have saber grinds, but good luck sharpening a 3v blade with a rock if you have to. With that caveat, an SRK and a Mora are solid for both beginners and experts.",

You seem to be asking the question of a camp knife specifically such as \u201ccamp holiday woodland camping\u201d. Typically, these tasks will involve: 1. Processing wood for kindling, 2. Cutting twine, rope, and packaging, and 3. Food preparation. In the case of only using one knife, a well made \u201csurvival knife\u201d will do fine. Something like an ESEE 6 or an SRK will be delicate enough to make a featherstick but large enough to chop veggies. Honestly, if you pick any fixed blade knife with a blade length between 4-6 inches and it\u2019s not ridiculously thick or thin with a weird grind, you\u2019ll be fine.",

Bonfires are big enough that if you can carry it it can go on the fire. I burn brush/slashpiles in all seasons except the driest ones, and I never need a knife, saw or axe for that. I just pick up the stuff cluttering the forest floor, throw it in a pile, and light a ball of small stuff near the bottom on the upwind side. Once it gets going, throw whatever you want on it.

Better pictures of fresher specimens will help us ID them. Try getting a picture of the whole mushroom from the top and bottom. Check to see if the stipe(stem) is brittle or fibrous.

But, an amanita egg can look just like a smaller puffball. If you think you have a puffball, cut it in half. It should be solid white all the way through. If you see a mushroom shape in the middle, it&#039;s an amanita. not a puffball. <br><br>It all comes back to knowing what the mushrooms your looking for look like and what the &quot;look alikes&quot; look like. There&#039;s almost always easy to distinguish with a little experience. The easiest way to start is to just go looking for mushrooms, not to eat, but just to see what&#039;s in your area. Take pictures, bring the pictures home and try and ID them. Eventually you&#039;ll become familiar with the mushrooms that grow in your area and can look for the ones that are edible.",

I had a 2nd gen and they&#039;re very easy to find with low miles because everyone is afraid of the headgasket job that needs to be done at 100k miles. If you see one for sale right around there, go ahead and add 2k to the price unless you do the job yourself. Isn&#039;t hard. I loved her to death. Honorable mention for the Baja which is the same platform just with the hatch sawn off and this little 1/4 size tailgate. It looks inbred and I love it.<br>Just realized you&#039;re aussie.

A machete feels more like a cheap jack of all trades than some sort of shame on all your ancestors for carrying. Sure you could carry a knife and you could carry a hatchet and those would do the job better (unless the job is cutting through undergrowth which is the one thing the machete does best, but realistically most people are not going to be cutting their own trails like that).<br><br>But a machete is a combination knife and hatchet that you do not give a shit about losing or ruining doing shit like batoning wood.

Not in the sense that it&#039;s just for show - if you know you can baton with a knife it means it doesn&#039;t break when you put it under stress, ok that&#039;s good - it&#039;s not like when they use a pan to hammer down nails in infomercials as if a pan that withstands 2 seconds of abuse is automatically good - it&#039;s just that people react against the sheer memetic value of practices that have ascended to marketing ritual. And in the /out/ world LITERALLY fucking EVERYTHING is a marketing ritual, cause nobody does that shit where you go out in the forest with a knife and le fucking survive. You park your car and walk 100 meters to the camping spot. That&#039;s what everyone does. The truth is that this whole hobby is a fucking meme, isn&#039;t it? It&#039;s nice to go camp but especially the obsession with knives has nothing to do with camping and I don&#039;t even believe anybody who actually goes camping is the target audience for this shit, it&#039;s not even LARPers this is targeted to.

While batoning firewood is completely unnecessary, batoning as a technique for constructing things out of wood like log sheds or bridges over a stream or an A-frame log mover is useful and one I employ a lot. It&#039;s more precise than an axe or hatchet when you really want to fit things together snuggly. But for firewood it&#039;s a waste of time and energy.<br><br>So my experience is: carry a knife you can baton with, just don&#039;t dick around wasting time with sawing perfect rounds and batoning them into little staves. Fire building is the simplest shit ever. Just remember to always start small to large and dry to wet. Break longer pieces by stepping on them, or let the fire burn them in half before pushing the rest in. Literally works every single time.",

The american coasts are much worse. Central US has less urban areas, but much less nature.

No?<br><br>Well this is a reality in my country. Rural people live in fear because bears come to their farms and plunder their crops and steal their animals. Heck, even in big cities like Brasov you have these bears that eat trash and terrorize the locals. I am not saying that we need to cut down our forests, just that we need to kill more bears, not all of them, just enough os that the population is not forced to go to cities and villages for food. There are too many bears for the amount of wilderness they have and yes we should have more forests and more protected land for them, however that takes time and we do not have that. The only utilitarian solution would be to bait and trap them, if the government is not willing to do anything about it.<br><br>Don&#039;t tell me that you are one of those hippies that would gladly eat game but don&#039;t you dare touch muh fuzzy lil bears, they didn do nuffin&#039;!

Rebuilding would be difficult, and larger countries like the US would take centuries to recover. Hostile survivor groups aside, the zombies are known to eat other mammals we depend on for survival. The livestock and game populations would plummet, and the longer you took to organize and finally wipe the fuckers out, the worse things would get. Our energy infrastructure gone, beasts of burden either dead or highly contested. Global supply chains rekt. There&#039;d be limited access to meat, fur, and leather.

The zombies are shit climbers in general (It&#039;s only shown once in season 1 as far as I know) and lack climbing gear entirely. <br><br>Basically have a camp with a decent view of the approachable areas and then have a retreat which I can climb up to if things get bad. <br><br>Go down into the valley once a week to get food or fish in the headwaters and spend the rest of the time in austere conditions to avoid humans. I&#039;d stay there maybe 6 months until everyone starved to death.<br><br>I know for 100% certain I can survive 8 months from fishing headwaters (have done it actually for real when I was homeless)<br><br>Plan A: My town (900 people) can only be accessed by crossing rivers so destroy the bridges, fortify along the rivers and rally the citizenry. Make blockades/checkpoints all that good stuff. Rural area so lots of people have the skills/tools/firearms/etc and everyone knows one another already. Large communal field in the center of town would be turned into a farm in addition to the gardens most people keep + the existing cattle farms in the area<br><br>There is a a 180-kW hydro electric dam right in town so it&#039;s very possible the town itself would stay standing purely for the proximity of all this infrastructure (the communal field is 400 feet from the dam) <br><br>There is a 900 kw dam about 5 miles away as well. Lots of fish in that reservoir.<br><br>This would really be Plan A but I&#039;m not sure how possible it would be (destroying bridges during a refugee crisis may not be accomplished fast enough) so I think planning on Plan B makes way more sense. <br><br>The real danger would be the refugees fleeing the major cities. They&#039;d strip the land like locust. There isnt enough food for all the people in the cities without industrialized farming. Their desperation would be immense. They would rob houses and kill livestock/pets for food. <br><br>Eventually the majority of them would die of starvation and things would return to relatively normal around my area.",

Most modern farmers no longer know how to produce food without pesticides and massive amounts of synthetic fertilizer. You don&#039;t want to know how many &quot;farmers&quot; I&#039;ve seen that ruined their gardens from spreading fresh manure, for example. Same with hunters, how many can preserve meat on the spot without having access to cooling? How many people, whether hunters or butchers, can still spot trichines with a razor, instead of requiring enzymatic digestion and a microscope? How many lumberjacks (or peolpe in general) can safely fell a tree with nothing but an axe or a handsaw? Hell, how many people even own suitable axes or saws in the first place?<br><br>I&#039;ve been doing a lot of stuff by hand since a couple of years ago, and the sad truth is that way too much knowledge has been lost. When I worked based on books and what &quot;experts&quot; (farmers, hunters, professors at uni etc) told me, I failed about 80% of the time. Using my own intelligence and theoretical understanding (and, not trying to toot my own horn, with ~180IQ and a chem / bio / mech engineering degree, that&#039;s more than most have), I still only succeeded around 50% of the time at first. Sometimes I failed from bad luck, sometimes from not understanding things (in those cases, the 2nd try worked most times), but most often, I simply couldn&#039;t get the right tools or materials. For example, it&#039;s damn near impossible to get a proper hoe, the ones stores sell are all too light and with shafts that are too short, meaning they exhaust you quickly and give back pain. Where with a proper hoe, I can work my small fields as fast as with a tractor (due to how often the tractor has to turn), with a hardwarestore hoe, it takes me five times longer.",

A road trip into the Indian Himalayas and then the Annapurna Circuit back when I was 18, a rafting trip down the Sun Kosi after that and, just a couple of years ago, big trekking/mountaineering trip doing EBC, the Three Passes and climbs to the top of Island Peak and Mera Peak. <br><br><a href=\"#p2829561\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;2829561</a><br>Basically nothing, bro. Annapurna Circuit is a teahouse trek so you&#039;ll be staying in accommodation every night. You don&#039;t need a tent, stove, food or anything like that. You could literally book flights right this second, get on the plane with nothing but a comfortable pair of shoes/boots and the clothes on your back, and you&#039;d have a good time.<br><br>At least, that&#039;s pretty much how it worked out for me. I can&#039;t remember if I had a hotel booked in Katmandu but probably not, definitely didn&#039;t have permits or trail accommodation organised. <br>That was about 10 years ago though so things might&#039;ve changed. The trails definitely seemed a lot busier on my more recent trip so it might be worth booking teahouses beforehand (you could definitely still do that from Katmandu though, just wouldn&#039;t count on being able to show up in a village and find a room when you arrive). I also hear that it&#039;s mandatory to have a guide now, fucking sucks if that&#039;s the case. I&#039;d guess that you&#039;ll find the cheapest guides booking in-country but more well-spoken guides booking in advance. I averaged well under $20/day traveling comfortably, I imagine it&#039;d be pricier now. I also heard there&#039;s been some road development cutting through Annapurna so make sure it&#039;s still worth doing.",

If you want to stand even a slight chance of seeing a snow leopard then, yeah, you&#039;ll definitely need a guide (ideally one with experience guiding naturalists and wildlife photographers), and you&#039;ll probably need to go somewhere a bit more remote. It&#039;s doable but would require much more organisation than just Annapurna. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What season/s did you go and which was the best? </span><br>All my trips have been in Autumn. Clearest views, everything&#039;s green after the monsoon and it&#039;s not too hot or too cold. Spring is supposed to be good too. Obviously these are the high seasons but they&#039;re the high season for good reasons. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anything to avoid, from food to scams?</span><br>Just the basic developing country travel stuff. <br>Last time I was there I made the mistake of eating the side salad that came with my burger on my last day in Katmandu. Threw up on the tarmac boarding our flight to Lukla and twice more on the first day of hiking. Rookie mistake t b h. Never eat the salad in a developing country. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Stuff to bring</span><br>Solar charger - You can charge your phones/cameras overnight at the teahouses but it&#039;s a hassle and often expensive.<br>Get a Steripen for water purification - Water filters don&#039;t handle viruses, chemicals are slow, and relying purely on boiled water from the teahouses is a hassle. <br>Rehydration solution/electrolyte powder - The dry air at altitude makes it easier to become dehydrated and being even a little dehydrated makes you much more susceptible to altitude sickness. I also brought a tub of BCAAs on my latest trip, most of the meals on offer will probably be pretty low in protein and this&#039;ll help with endurance.",

Day 1, totally normal. Day 2, we get drunk that evening then do mushrooms. Friend starts flipping the fuck out, clutching his chest and screaming that hes dying, and we HAVE TO GO NOW.<br><br>We took all of the garbage from the campsite, food wrappers, bottles, chips, eggshells, beer bottles etc, threw it in the tent, then rolled up the tent like a big trash burrito. What was incredible was the tent trash burrito perfectly filled up the tent storage bag, like a great big inflated brick.<br><br>Maybe 8 months later we heard that his uncle was pissed off about his tent being a fermented mold ball.

What&#039;s funny is you pay 80 dollars a year, and those naggers STILL won&#039;t pay the licensing fees to give us back the Topo maps they had for years. I am hoping paying this money allows me to get some glimpse of community content/user submitted trails - I&#039;ve found all sorts of cool stuff on unofficial trails. They also took away the ability to see user photos while hiking on the trail, which let you position yourself for the best views, and now they have a community heatmap which is strangely much less useful. <br><br>Custom Routes gives you the ability to build your ideal trail, whether it\u2019s a short loop or a multi-night through-hike. Members can start from scratch, customize existing trails, and use new AllTrails smart-routing, which leverages AI to make a trail shorter, less steep, or \u201cmore scenic\u201d with just a tap.<br><br>Trail Conditions provides expected condition information along the trail, including temperature, precipitation, and snow depth. Functioning as a weather app within the AllTrails platform, Trail Conditions combines analysis of 15 weather factors with geospatial intelligence and recent reviews. More than 10 million data points power Trail Conditions, which also includes alerts for air quality and mosquito activity. A future update will add terrain and ground conditions showing pavement, gravel, mud, and more.<br><br>Community Heatmap allows you to see trail traffic data to find popular trails or quieter hidden gems. Supported by millions of trailgoers\u2019 activities, Community Heatmap gives insights into recent outdoor activity to help members plan an adventure that aligns with their preferences.",

A catfish rod is inappropriate for bluegill, and a bluegill rod is inappropriate for catfish. This is a simple fact. It has nothing to do with capitalism, greed, etc. etc. Your first choice rod depends on what kind of fishing you would be inclined to do and how much you want to spend. Look into the different types of fishing, because there are some significant differences, and decide which one you like best. Again, there is no such thing as an all around rod. An ultra-light cannot sling muskie lures or 3 oz sinkers, and a beefstick of a baitcaster can&#039;t toss 1/32 oz jigs.",

Daiwa or Shimano mogs all other reels. Spending 50 EUR on a low end Shimano will get you a better reel than some off-brand chinkshit in a starter kit.<br><br>Get a rod without a trigger grip - trigger grips go with baitcasters, not spinning reels. Look at the rod to see the lure weights. Now here&#039;s your decision point:<br><br>Will you fish in the sea or in lakes/rivers?<br>If only lakes, you can go for &quot;lighter&quot; equipment: 5-20 g lures and a rod rated similarly, reels whose numbers start with 2 (&quot;Daiwa Fagmaster 2000&quot;, &quot;Shimano Cockfisher 200&quot;, etc).<br><br>If you will fish from shore in the sea, step up to 15-40 gram lures + rods, and reels whose numbers start with 3-4. You can also use this in lakes but you&#039;ll have a hard time casting really light baits for smaller fish like small perch. <br><br>Lures, bitches. <br>Lakes and light gear? Get a pair of spinners, a pair of small spoons, and an assorted box of grub jigs + heads. Colors - get 1 metallic like silver for bright days, copper for dusk, and a neon/garish color for murky water. <br><br>Lakes and heavier gear? Still get spoons and spinners, but heavier. If you can afford a minnow, get a rapala or something. I&#039;ll freely admit that minnows is a fucking jungle, back in my day we had a rapala and we liked it. These are mostly for pike or other large predators. <br><br>Sea? Spoons, casting jigs, and more spoons. Heavy stockier spoons for deep water, casting jigs for deep and shallow alike, slim spoons for surface fishing for pelagics. Copper, holographic silver/blue/green, and a garish color is fine. <br><br>Line? I don&#039;t know, I take a braided line and go as thin as I dare, like breaking strength 10 kg in the sea. <br><br>t. a fucking casual who catches a fish every now and then on his low-end shimano gear with a bunch of cheap casting jigs.",

Bigger the typical fish, bigger the hook. How deep do you want to fish? The deeper, the heavier the weight. Do you want to fish fast or slow? If fast forget hooks and weights and get baits that you can just reel in steadily (like crank baits, spinner baits, buzz baits). The type of line is trickier, but for a beginner just get cheap mono. The bigger the fish, the heavier the line required. Big fish? Big rod. Get a spinning reel as a beginner so you can learn to cast.<br>But to answer your first question fishing is difficult to get into because humans have done it to survive forever. We&#039;ve eaten all kinds of fish, each preferring specific baits, fished in different ways. The sport aspect of that really expands the options to a level beyond practicality because it is profitable. It&#039;s as easy as buying the cheapest rod, line and bait and tying it on. Much like driving a 400 dollar shit box, spending more money often makes the journey more comfortable and quicker",

Hell you can go even lower if you swap your rod for a minnow trap. Minnows still count as fish and you&#039;re still catching them, so you&#039;re fishing. It&#039;s only when you decide to catch specific fish of specific sizes that things start to get complicated.",

A lot of cheap land has weird situations with access but sometimes can be ironed out with locals. Good neighbors can be a godsend but bad ones a nightmare. Sometimes Iand has interesting plants and features not known by sellers. Spend the effort to make sure your foundation is solid and level. It should take 50 percent of the build time imo. Invest in some decent cordless tools. I got some used paslode framing and finishing nailers for $125 and took them apart and cleaned them. Very worth it in terms of time to build using them. A good driver also has been useful. Spend extra money on good interior and exterior insulation. buy a good little stove. I have a cubic grizzly. Very small maybe too small, but also I got the roaster attachment so now I can bake and roast small meals. I think Capybara xl would be my choice if I did it again just for a bit more burn time. Spend the extra money on triple paned glass too.the better you insulate the more comfortable you&#039;re gonna be. Take some time to plant different stuff early and see what works. Very hard to grow certain things in a forest. I&#039;ve got a variety of nut and fruit trees and it&#039;s been an interesting learning experience. If you can afford it get the most mature trees you can. If on a budget you can grow a lot from groceries if you are patient with time to learn from mistakes. Berries grow well in forest settings but everything grows slow there. Start them in a city yard in full sun if you are able, and transplant in fall.",

In the summer there are clouds of mosquitos that block out the sun and in the winter there is no sun. You can&#039;t grow enough food but they do give you as a resident a bag limit of 1-2 fish a day for multiple species, some of them 10 a day, and some of them 2 anually. So you can fish all summer if you have a boat. You can also get subsistance hunting tier i and tier ii licenses for all the big game and a trapping license as well which includes beaver so you can do this all fall and winter. You could probably greenhouse vegetables until it is night all the time and then uv lamp/hydroponic a lot of vegetables. But you&#039;re going to want electricity. You can make a hydro dam if you design and meet requirements with just some turbines and pvc pipes. All of this will cost you more money than your government wellfare stipend though so for money you may want to open and staff a liquor store that sells lottery tickets for guaranteed revenue in alaska.",

It also only have 34 species of scorpion of which only one is deadly. Arizona is 75-80% arid or semiarid and 20-25% is temperate (Canada climate). AZ is 25-28% forest with most of it temperate high elevation (over 1400m) forest. There are at least 8 different kinds of forest in AZ. Arizona&#039;s high desert is colder than the coldest places in Australia. AZ&#039;s low desert is hotter than the hottest places in Australia. Every single summer Arizona hits 50-52C in its low desert along the Colorado river, and every single winter it hits -30C (in 4 separate locations). This range is greater than the all time record high and low recorded in Australia in the last 150 years. Six separate macro regions in AZ receive more than 3.5m (140 in) of average winter snowfall, around 3 of these regions are a much larger land area that receives at least 1.27m (50 in), these regions total over 5,000 sq miles (12,950 sq km), an area larger than the Snowy Mountains. <br><br>Arizona has at least 210 geologically and geographically recognized mountain ranges, with a minimum of 7,515 peaks using the US mountaineering standard of 91m prominence, this is the 3rd highest in the USA. It is estimated that many dozens more unnamed peaks are not cataloged still. It is possible to drive 300 miles (480 km) one way in Arizona never dropping below 1830m (6,000 ft) elevation, even at this elevation AZ&#039;s highest peak still has another 1800m to go. Twelve of AZ&#039;s 15 counties has peaks with a minimum of 3,280 ft (1 km) of technical prominence, AZ&#039;s highest vertical relief peak has roughly 7,930 ft of vertical relief within 10 nm (18.5 km). <br><br>Arizona has consistently been in the top 3 US states for gun rights since 2011 (permitless in bars to), it also has the highest firearm industry manufacturing base per capita in the USA (and thus the world).

I&#039;m glad you have gotten it and I get your point that neurotic people obsess over not get ticks on them. Just cause you get bit doesn&#039;t mean you will contract Lyme disease and even if you contract it it can lay dormant for years and once you start show symptoms it&#039;s to late. The fear of Lyme disease is not the rate of transmission but the sometimes debilitating effects it can have on some one.",

So many parks are literally coasting on barely-revised 1930&#039;s CCC stone facilities and paths. It would be a dream to get the trails in even state and national forests restored to cleared, passable, marked condition. I think that would have to come with both a commitment to work hard, and also to relax some regulations on using power tools in sensitive areas. There&#039;s so many places where there used to be more developed recreational access and facilities and things were abandoned 50-100 years ago or more that could easily be restored and it&#039;s not THAT expensive. <br><br>It&#039;s pretty annoying to have a million different sets of fees and gates and allowed entry times for each individual park, it would be nice to have it more open, and like, if there&#039;s not enough parking, build more parking instead of charging fees or adding draconian rules",

Another issue is immigrant populations rarely see American nature as worthy of preserving, the biggest two reasons being they don&#039;t see America as their home but just a workplace for eight months a year, and simply being so consumed with city life and industrialized society that they&#039;ve never experienced the beauty of nature and don&#039;t see the appeal any more than they&#039;d see the appeal of never cutting the grass in your backyard while letting a family of raccoons nest in your basement.",

First, people complain that there are too many foreigners in the parks. Then, they complain that foreigners have no interest in the parks. Don&#039;t you think that some Chinese Americans might do a trip with their Chinese family to the National Parks every few years. Furthermore, what immigrants are only here for 8 months? The current problem is &quot;migrants workers&quot; who try to stay here forever. No one takes 4 month vacations, especially not illegal, blue collar laborers. The ideal scenario to actualize your stupid reality is to have all the teachers in this country be foreigners, but even then, they&#039;d only have about 3 months vacation and not all would go back to their place of origin.",

But I think they are shitty to walk in, often you get wet with sweat and unless the weather is very extreme if you are going back each day and not staying out does it really matter if you get wet? Consider gaiters as an option unless you are walking in the rain they will go a long way to keeping your legs and feet dry. <br><br>I carry w/proof legs and jacket as well as thermal baselayer waterproofed in my daysack when I am out for day hikes but rarely put on a waterproof as I rarely stop long enough to get cold and am usually out for only 4-8 hours. I&#039;d rather get wet than overheated and get sticky/sweaty, for whatever reason I walk hot and am comfortable at 0c in shorts and tshirt + gloves unless there is a moderate or more windchill.",

First step of the Pennine way when I was younger, I was following an old map and missed my route so ended up camping up on Bleaklow as it got dark rather then pressing on to the actual campsite in Crowden. I slept like shit so packed up my tent at about 6am, surrounded by clouds. The descent towards the reservoir is along a gorge with a narrow track along it. It&#039;s been a long time since I did it, but in my 22 year old mind I had a fairly vertical rock wall on my left and a deep drop into a river far below on my right. Exhausted and regretting everything, I was trying to make my way down the path on a couple hours sleep when a sheep looms out of the cloud at me and wouldn&#039;t move. There&#039;s no way I can move around it and if it&#039;s startled when I move, it&#039;ll push me down and probably kill me. I ended up yelling at this stupid fucking sheep for about 20 minutes when eventually he turned and disappeared.<br><br>I wasn&#039;t moving particularly fast but by the time I followed the path the sheep had completely disappeared and there was no trace of it. The farmer didn&#039;t have his sheep in the nearby fields either so it must have been an extremely lost sheep looking at a lost hiker. <br><br>All other sheep are okay.",

Hundreds of deer though, probably a great place to be a redneck poacher.<br><br>You can access the river north of where the lake used to be without trespassing through yards via this piece of mostly forested public land just south of where the dam itself broke, I have caught some fat tasty walleye there when they come screaming through the tittabawasse river to and from the bay. I live in Maine now so I don&#039;t mind sharing the spot.",

Can you land fast accurate shots on an ~8x8 target moving at you rapidly with a 9mm? If so, get some +p hardcast loads and carry with confidence- I honestly think the reason so many people start fudding out about needing a 500SW giga cannon is because most people fucking suck at shooting (especially under duress) and would rather get one mediocre hit with a huge damaging caliber than training enough to be able to land multiple accurate hits with a smaller, lighter weapon. Bear skulls aren&#039;t bulletproof for fucks sake. Also, bring bear spray. 9/10 times a bear doesn&#039;t want to fuck with you and spray alone will end any encounter. No need to kill the thing if it&#039;s just alarmed or acting defensive.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t. Alaskan who carries both bear spray and a G19 innawoods</span>",

That being said polar bears and grizzly\u2019s have been found with 9mm and lower caliber rounds, or even buckshot in their chests and skulls that have been there for years.

Was fucking sick, this 400lb bear was sitting on his ass in the rain like a fat fuck at the bus station, just eating garbage. I lit him up with a bike light and he just looks up from an old yogurt container like, &quot;excuse you, I&#039;m busy.&quot; I had the light pointed directly where I had the slingshot drawn and watched the steel shot connect with his paw. I followed him down the road about 100 ft, he turned around, and I beaned him again, then 100ft later he turned again I managed to land another. He kept running well out of sight. Hopefully that fucker is terrified of people now, because I actually love bears and a bear that fears people is a bear that stays alive.<br><br>There&#039;s no point to that story, I just felt badass. Anyway leave your gun at home, use your brain first and bear spray as a final resort. A 9mm isn&#039;t enough stopping power to kill a grizz. Don&#039;t camp on game trails, string your food up in a tree a good distance from your camp, don&#039;t cook where you sleep, if you&#039;re in a thicket announce your presence, etc. You&#039;ll probably be alright. But for fucksake if a grizzly starts fucking with your camp site, even in the middle of the night, it&#039;s time to leave.",

He said he grew up believing that it was dishonorable to sell it for yourself because you&#039;d be taking food out of generations worth of descendant&#039;s mouths. It would be especially taboo to sell to people from the city. <br>Sadly those norms have died with my grandparents generation and everyone sells their inherited land to go do stupid shit with it. Cartel members tend to buy up all the land and do weird shit with it like build compounds or outposts.<br>It&#039;s very sad to see that be the case in the USA as well.

You have corpos like Bayer (which acquired Monsanto) which seek to make any seeds you buy nonviable, as in the plants will grow fruit, but won&#039;t reproduce. There are a few different examples of corpos pushing the monopolization of our food, and history can speak on the willingness of the ruling class to engineer food scarcity. It won&#039;t be like the Soviet union here in the states, where all food is stolen from the farmers (at least I don&#039;t think), however food will keep increasing in price to the point where buying groceries will become a significant strain on your budget, and buying meats may become untenable for the majority. Then you will also have engineered scarcity with manufactured crises which call for culling tons of livestock and the destruction of crops. The only way to combat this will be good production yourself, which won&#039;t be illegal, but alas, you must buy your seeds from them year after year. Livestock may be the only source of food they can&#039;t readily fuck with due to the nature of live birth being the means of reproduction, but they can always mandate a cull if you are within radius of another diseased animal (which they can create the conditions with ease).<br>All of that said, uprooting your life isn&#039;t necessary at the moment, but starting a garden or even just a few planters is never a bad idea",

I&#039;ve watched some of them go into a clean toilet and when they come out there&#039;s shit or piss everywhere. They shit beside the toilet, on the floor, on the walls, or sometimes all over the toilet seat. If they do shit in the toilet they&#039;ll often stand up on the seat, squat down, and do their business. I see footprints on toilet seats all the time.<br><br>we also get a lot of mexicans who know how to hit the toilet but always throw their shitty toilet paper on the floor because in mexico they don&#039;t put used paper in the toilets.<br><br>it&#039;s not racist, it&#039;s just different cultures.

Some of them require repairs every year above 6,500 ft elevation. Some of the lesser known and lesser used paved roads in the high country surrounding entirely by US NF (national forest) do get moderately damaged from winter freezes/thaw cycles and heavy snowfall and rockslides in both winter and monsoons, they just get closed down from November to May usually. I know of a couple stretches in AZ that are potholed to hell (pic not related), but the state does a decent job of repairing them every summer, only for them to return next spring. The I-40 between Flagstaff and Williams AZ averages 90 inches of snow a winter (the most in the US for a major highway not passing through the Rockies)and has an armada of snowplows to keep it open every storm because it is main national transport artery from the west to east coasts. Monuments and national park infrastructure costs a lot to maintain because it has the highest traffic bar none among US public lands, like literally 5-100s of times more traffic than NF areas. Most of the roads in the South Rim Grand Canyon have been totally resurfaced within the last couple to few years at most, and it only gets 30-80 inches of winter snowfall. I&#039;m not saying the government doesn&#039;t waste money, but that it is easy to waste money with just upkeep costs.",

I&#039;m really disappointed in my current mattress setup and have had great experiences with airbeds in the past. Are inflatable pads intended for camping all that different from an air mattress? Can they last long enough (a year+) to justify using them as a fulltime sleep device, or are they simply not made for nightly use? Please give me your wisdom /out/.",

We fooled around a few times and that was that, but she did wind up in my camp spot a few times and I had nothing but a nice little carpet I used as a sleeping pad to lay on (it really tied the spot together)<br><br>A few days later I was walking to my sleep spot in Corona Heights and I saw some strange homebum guy standing at the entrance to the park. This park is uphill both ways from where we hang out in the Haight and there&#039;s never any homebums hanging out around it because it&#039;s a millionaire&#039;s neighborhood several steep blocks uphill from any sort of convenience store. When he noticed me from a block away it was like he was waiting for me with how he suddenly straightened up, ready to talk. <br><br>As I began to walk past him he offered me a brand new inflatable sleeping pad, saying he had extras that he didn&#039;t need. I took the pad and that was that, the entire interaction. He began walking down the hill and I never saw him again. That was the time some glownigger handlers in San Francisco gave me a sleeping pad.",

Recently I got a zenbivy pad as well and am definitely a fan of how much smaller and lightweight they are, the valve system is also a plus. I have been using the mat in the photo for about 5 years with no issues, could probably use it every night for ears as it is pretty well built, came with patch kit if needed but haven&#039;t needed it.",

NEMO Roamer... got it on a great sale during christmas time one year for camping, set it up to try for a couple of nights in the house before taking it camping... it never left the house after. the most shocking thing to me was that it hasn&#039;t seemed to lose ANY air over the years. not even in the winter and I keep it pretty chilly inside. my cat even got it&#039;s claw hung in it once and I was sure it was doomed, but never lost any air. it&#039;s basically a memory foam/air chamber design from my understanding. I&#039;m the type of person that usually tosses and turns every hour or so in my sleep. stomach, side, back, everything. I was shocked when I first tried it for the first couple of nights because I literally didn&#039;t even wake up at all during the night. I awoke in the morning the same way I fell asleep, which I can&#039;t remember doing since I was a kid. it&#039;s pretty damn amazing, and despite getting it heavily discounted, I&#039;d buy another one at msrp if I had to without any hesitation. they make a XL size one, but even the standard is longer than most mattresses which is good for tall people. I&#039;m 6ft and don&#039;t hang off. can&#039;t say someone else will have the same results, but I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever been as surprised with anything I&#039;ve bought.",

If you managed to walk your fat ass 1 mile down one of the thousands of trailheads you would&#039;ve landed yourself in one of the most incredible wildernesses on the planet. No Chinese tour busses full of traveller diarrhea spraying retards ready to standing-spackle the nearest all over the toilet, no garbage, no sweaty Texans, just fuckin&#039; grizzly bears, wolves, beavers, and eagles. <br><br>Next time you come to Yellowstone Anon enter through the Beartooth Highway in Montana, pick a lake with a primitive campground 5+ miles from the trailhead, stay there for 3 nights while you hit day hikes in the area and eat fish you catch from the lake, have yourself a real adventure that you&#039;ll remember for the rest of your life. You do that and you&#039;ll come back home with seed so potent and so grateful you&#039;re not sleeping on the ground in grizzly bear country anymore that you&#039;ll keep your wife pregnant for years.",

I wouldn&#039;t do it again though looking back on it unless i bring a second pair of shoes and socks.<br><br>Anyway small mud puddles, snow, streams? absolutely. Snow patches though can be deceiving so i&#039;d probably always probe it before you step and realize it sinks in down to your knees, but that&#039;s a minor annoyance.

In the meantime do not allow ecological conservation to become a faggy liberal talking point. Concede both Conservatives and Gay Communists agree with respect to conservation. Unfortunately the best tool we have against allowing state sales of valuable ecosystems are litigious. Be aware of proposed state logging sales, speak at public comment, donate money, time, and energy to private law firms suing the state to prevent these sales. Join your local conservation groups - Trout/Ducks/Elk Unlimited. Meet people, plan, discuss efforts to preserve habitat. Remember - the state sells public lands to make money and spending money to fight over logging sales in court cuts to the quick of the issue. If the logging companies are so great at forestry, let them manage the forests they already shit all over 50 years ago. <br><br>I don&#039;t know, maybe go start a logging company and hustle for government contracts for fire mitigation.

It&#039;s too bad the government won&#039;t take this land via eminent domain to reduce pollution. Almost nothing is old growth here, they took what they could a long time ago, but I don&#039;t see why old growth can&#039;t be manually recreated it&#039;s really just about having a few tall old trees and not too much undergrowth and a functioning soil biome and the big issue here, I think, is that when they logged they left slash, slash burned the soil, killing the fungus in the soil, and that&#039;s what led to the shitty scrubby/brushy stuff that pops up in what used to be basically pure coniferous high elevation old growth land here",

You remove yourself from the comforts and conveniences of modern life, that includes things like infrastructure and civilization.

Won&#039;t need to have your sleeping bag partially cover face to warm breathe or a sleeping mat.<br>Once you get to the 40s at night you&#039;ll want to look into both of those. Ive used a coarse sweater before over my face to preheat my breathe while i sleep down to 30s but most the mummy sleeping bags now go around your face now for that reason. If you dont have a sleeping mat you&#039;ll want to use a bunch of tall grasses to put under your tent. If on the ground make sure its relatively flat with your head at the higher elevation and clear any sticks or rocks underneath. You can also use a rock or a poop shovel to loosen up the dirt a bit.<br>Make sure to bring plenty of water and save yourself and start by water maxing until your stomach feels bloated and after about 15 mins of hiking you&#039;ll feel great.<br>You only need the tent to keep bugs out. My one concern cowboy camping is my neighbor had a rattle snake crawl into his sleeping bag for warmth and he ended up losing his legs.",

I&#039;d just bring a sheet of visqueen, some line, a couple cans of whatever, a bag each of rice and beans, fork, spoon, knife, and hatchet and a ferro stick and I was good for a week of camping. First day I&#039;d set up the lean-to from the visqueen, eat the two cans of food, then use the cans for cooking and boiling water for the rest of the week. I&#039;d make a makeshift bow and arrow and use that to get trout from the river, if I didn&#039;t get a fish that day then I still had the beans and rice on which to fall back.<br><br>If it got cold at night I&#039;d just pull the visqueen down and cover up with it, then put it back up the next morning.",

I&#039;m probably happy just doing the diving, but spearfishing seems like an easy and practical extension. I only casually skindive and rod-and-reel fish at the moment. Does anyone have experience taking such a course?<br>I know I&#039;ll need my own gear early on, but each instructor I can find seems to have their own equipment shops, so I imagine they wouldn&#039;t be impartial about the quality of other gear on the market. I live on the Pacific coast of the US, so I see that a 7 mm open cell wetsuit is strongly recommended. What good/bad features should I look out for on wetsuits and other equipment? For non-competitive diving, carbon fiber fins are almost certainly not worth the price, right?",

I had the same initial reaction to the courses, especially for beginners, but looking around the web there seems to be a strong consensus on the advantages you point out. I&#039;d much rather spend a relatively small amount of money, considering the huge amount of time and safety knowledge it would net me versus trying to ignorantly assemble techniques and practice methods myself. Really, it seems almost foolish to not get certified unless one plans on doing nothing but paddling around your local lake with a buddy.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;purge valve</span><br>Do you use it often? I saw a lot of &quot;simpler is better&quot; for freediving snorkels, since you mostly don&#039;t use it once you&#039;re reading to start diving, and extra features like that just add drag or things that could go wrong with your equipment.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;5 mm open cell</span><br>Good to know that&#039;s doable at those temperatures.

Diving with an air source should never be attempted unless you have scuba training.<br>On the other hand, people have been freediving to hundreds of feet for millennia to search for food and pearls. Our bodies evolved to be in the water. Under wetness and pressure, your heart rate slows, your organs process oxygen more efficiently, you are physically unable to fill your lungs with water even if you wanted to. In one breath of air there\u2019s not enough nitrogen buildup to cause you problems, unless you\u2019re going deeper than a few hundred feet. For freediving, the challenge is not breath holding. If you\u2019re not a chainsmoker, most fit people can hold their breath for 2 minutes under water without too much trouble. What you need to learn to start out is the Frenzel equalization technique.

Some people that spearfish like to get reflective lenses so that the fish can&#039;t tell they&#039;re being looked at. Other people specifically want clear lenses so that if they black out or are in trouble their diving buddy can see their eyes. I haven&#039;t tried a lot of masks, but the color of the silicone also matters to some degree. White/clear will let more light in, which can be semi-blinding on bright days, but perhaps improves your vision below the surface. Black will give you tunnel vision but cuts down on that glare on the surface.",

The lungs are just flimsy sacks, the diaphragm doesnt firmly support them, it just moves down to stretch them open. The ribs are outside of them and not stopping them from getting compressed.

There are only a few places in the world a freediving instructor can make enough to survive on only that income, and they are mainly tourist towns in SEA, along the Mediterranean, or Hawaii/California/Florida. Even then it&#039;s constantly chasing new clients on Social media or opening a dive shop. Neither is appealing to me. And when I personally turn my passions into work, the passion dies.<br><br>I also hate the general population. People want to pay money for spoon-fed info just to say they did it. I only ever took classes to personally progress when I couldn&#039;t get deeper myself. And after living and working in said tourist towns, all over the world, and seeing the horror that is the modern middle class tourist, I&#039;ll never teach a freediving class again. <br><br>What you learn in the classes is the safest way to do everything. And no school system (padi, molchanovs, SSI, Fii) teaches the techniques or training style needed to get deeper than 40m. Their insurance just won&#039;t allow it. regardless of the (nearly) spotless record of competition freediving, we just don&#039;t have enough info for insurance companies to take the risk of teaching people to dive past 40m. Plus the majority of normies that take a level 1 class, have no desire to get level 2 or 3. 98% of freedivers will never hit 40m.<br><br>For me competition freediving is much more worthwhile. It&#039;s hard to get info on what the pro&#039;s do to get deeper and finding a training partner that has the will to dive that deep, consistently, with access to that depth is a real challenge. But it&#039;s so worth while. You get a small nugget of info from a mythical freediver, and it helps you break through and open up 10 more meters of depth.

It&#039;s more that I could have used this skill a lot years ago, when I happened to be spending more time around good places to dive.<br>I&#039;m an exceptionally low-stress and calm individual, so it seems to be a natural fit for me. Your description of your (mind-bogglingly) deep dive reminds me a lot of &quot;Le grand bleu&quot;. It&#039;s one of my favorite films, even apart from the diving connection. It does seem dangerous to be so deep though, when your buddy is likely quite far away, and you&#039;re starting to go third-person. Molchanova just disappeared one day, and at only ~40 m or so. It won&#039;t stop me from diving, but the ocean is a horrifyingly powerful entity to put yourself at the mercy of. I&#039;m also way too much of a wuss to do high lining, though.<br>I&#039;m only a beginner, and changed cities just after having completed my initial certification. So I&#039;ve only dived to ~17 meters, because that was farther than my instructor had asked us to attempt, and I didn&#039;t want to get in trouble or go unsafely beyond some threshold depth I wasn&#039;t aware of. It was awesome though, I had no troubles at all and was totally ecstatic to be alone in this unique location. I&#039;ll go deeper once I am finished settling in here and find people to dive with, since I don&#039;t want to violate the never-alone rule. I would like to get into spearfishing, since I already enjoy rod-and-reel and I get to explore underwater habitats at the same time.<br><br>Besides once tapping a fish in open water that didn&#039;t sense me behind it, I clearly don&#039;t have anything interesting to talk about yet. How long did it take you to work up to 68 m, and did you feel like most of that progress was from lessons? Do you also dive just to sightsee underwater, and if so, what are your favorite environments?",

I&#039;ve found that baits with multiple small hooks works well, whether that be 2 or 3 small trebles or singles. the main thing is that the small light wire hooks penetrate the boney mouth with much less force. I just give the rod a light tug after they grab it. lures like small topwaters. walking baits, poppers, etc. you have to be patient with them and slow it down though. a lot of times they won&#039;t chase a lure that is too fast. if you just do a little action to get their attention, then you let it sit for them to come up to, they usually just grab it when it&#039;s sitting there. they don&#039;t spook from lures easily, so you can just keep on casting it out near them. you&#039;re right though, they don&#039;t fight that hard until they get close to the bank and figure out what&#039;s going on, but a heavy leader should hold up. they do throw the lure at about a 50% clip though, just the nature of the boney mouth. doing the boomer rope lure trick is not good because they starve to death if you can&#039;t get it out, plus that&#039;s cheating.",

I suggest using a lure that is at least 1/2oz. just dial your brakes back one clock each time you have no overruns. overhead casts will result in disaster when you&#039;re new if it accidentally goes straight towards the ground. but when you do start trying overhead casts, remember to release much earlier than you think you should based on spinning reels. you want an arc cast.",

You want to accelerate smoothly until the very moment your thumb lets off. Your ultimate goal is for the spool to dump line at the same rate that your lure is flying, favoring slightly dragging because a backlash happens when your spool spins faster than your lure is flying. Make sure you play with your centrifugal or magnetic brakes, too. <br>And dont forget you can feather the spool, too, just barely touch thw spool for not even a moment can do a lot for slowing the spool and preventing a backlash.

I probably average several miles once a week over the span of 3-4 hours. some fishing thrown in there. the good thing about a kayak is just exploring also. places you could never otherwise get to easily, even banks on the far side of lakes and such. find lots of lures too..",

Id also suggest that you can still marinate the fish, but try drying the skin with paper towel and applying cooking oil directly to the fish moments before it goes on the grill. Also use your spatula to fully dislodge the skin before you try to flip. Might also be worth trying injection marinating instead of slicing the skin, that cant be making it any easier to keep the skin in tact.",

It&#039;s a super light, very fast very sensitive rod for 35 maple Bux, until recently it was just 30. I like the chrome guides in place of inserts because they don&#039;t crack they just bend. I&#039;ve been on vacation in Florida just casting at Lady fish for 2 weeks straight sitting on the beach with a toddler, dragging salty sandy braid over the guides, never had an issue with grooving. I&#039;m on my 3rd one, first one I broke when it was lying on its side and I was making a cast with my heavy casting rod and the leader wrapped around the tip, second rod lasted about 3 years and I just broke it recently high sticking a 6lb pike while I wasn&#039;t paying attention and my novice friend was being retarded with the net. 6 years and I&#039;m just now cresting over 100$ in rods. <br><br>It feels way better than the Shimano stimula which is almost 50% more expensive, and my stimula broke almost immediately after buying it under very basic conditions. <br><br>It&#039;s not as tough as fiberglass rods, but it also feels as good as the expensive rods, which are no more durable. I&#039;d rather have the sensitivity with the understanding that carbon is more brittle and only be out 35$ every few years. <br><br>I throw bass frogs and big pike spoons with 20lb braid, as well as lightweight bait rigs with 6lb mono. I keep buying other rods and I keep coming back to this one. I&#039;m convinced it&#039;s basically the only freshwater spinning rod I&#039;m going to buy so long as it&#039;s available",

Before I started it was advised by /out/ to join a sailing club but I found that just getting an entry level deckhand job on a commercial boat is a better way since you will learn all you need to know and will get paid for it, and many tourist jobs can be done part time if you already have another career. The hardest part about owning a boat is not sailing but maintaining it. You can teach yourself to sail proficiently with a book and a weekend\u2019s worth of practice but to maintain an old boat requires a lot of time, troubleshooting, and money. I would recommend you find a part time or even full time job that involves maintenance on some level.",

For short term in the future stuff you want to look for the NR listings. Then figure out when they come available. I&#039;m hobocamping in a Walmart parking lot atm waiting for midnight to book a campsite I want in Teton. Some come available 4 days out, some up to 14. <br><br>The best tip is just show up and pray. Most of my camping is done diapered camping for free in national forests. And as far as I know Maine is essentially a giant national forest. And yeah some areas especially around national parks have done away with that. But even then most of the time you can find a paid for national forest site for the night. <br><br>An ancillary tip to the last one is get a cripple card for the national forest. It halves all your camping fees even if you want to camp in bougie Teton. I got mine because the army says I&#039;m a cripple, but as far as I understand it can be literally anything. That one frog poster that cries about tinitus could get one of these cards.",

Sucks if you want to do desert stuff I guess but if that&#039;s the case you should look at Namibia and Botswana, or the Arabic Peninsula.<br>Cameroon is a bit of a crapshoot. The north and north-west have had some pretty unstable coexistance for the francophone population and anglophone minority and things have gotten a lot worse in the last decade. Incursions by nigerian armed groups and jihadists do not help. The south is okay but tough to get in unless you&#039;re travelling with a guide or some people who know their stuff because it&#039;s mostly dense tropical forests. <br>Central African Republic is o be avoided unless you want to get shot.<br>Congo-Brazza is fine, Congo-Kinshasa is to be avoided.<br>No matter where you go though, you must first map out the parks and if you plan on getting in there, contact the rangers beforehand. Depending on where you are, you could wind up in areas that have to deal with poaching be it of animals or wood, and rangers don&#039;t fuck around with that. They need to know what groups to look out for and what guys to shoot at because they&#039;re trying to grab some gorilla sperm to sell to chinese madmen who think it will make them immortal or some shit.",

It was to a fucked place called the Skagway power plant, near Cripple Creek, CO. The guy with the GF said that it was just a 5 mile hike so I thought that would be a nice and easy hike. Turns out that you had to cross rapids using rotten logs and old ropes. We survived, but this ignoramus decided it would be a great idea to tightrope walk on the rotten logs rather then cross the creek with boulders and extra support. We screamed at her for being retarded but she didn&#039;t care. She even crossed a log with her BF that was 10 feet above a section that would kill you rather than take the safer part and get wet. Me and my other friend don&#039;t hike with them any more because they like shit trails and are basically suicidal.",

It was really amusing how easily I could bully them to go further up the trail than they wanted to go. When we did Bison Gulch I got them to go up a final half mile scree section they didn&#039;t want to, but once we got up there they were very grateful. Both hikes were strangely hazardous - one had an extremely aggressive cow moose and one had human traffickers, rather troublesome.<br><br>With my wife, our first date was a two night/three day camp out at a campground about twenty miles from her city. She was a nervous girl then and hadn&#039;t spent much time with me outside of the lab (my student), so we did the campground as a relatively safe (in her mind, lol) way to camp.<br><br>Second date she came up to my city and we attempted a trail and overnight in the white mountains. God said no, the worst fucking rain I&#039;ve ever seen in the interior hit us as soon as we got across the first creek, after a mile the trail had three inches of water in it, after two miles the trail occasionally dipped into flooded patches of alderjail with water up to my knees. After four miles the rain was positively torrential and the temperature had dropped, she and the dog clearly had hypothermia and I had to emergency set up the tent and keep them both from perishing. After they warmed up and we decided to turn I packed up the tent again, we got about a half mile down the trail and the rain abruptly stopped - sunshine and rainbows. Also very clear tracks about a mile from the truck showing we missed a monster of a moose.<br><br>Third date we went for a two night hike&#039;n&#039;camp near her city, was pretty nice, I caught some decent fish.<br><br>It continued in more or less that fashion until we had kids. She fell down a mountain the day I proposed to her, which was funny after seeing she wasn&#039;t too badly hurt. Experienced some inexplicable stuff in the wild on a few occasions with her. Never boring, certainly.",

Didn&#039;t need to get either of them into /out/. <br>I met my ex through a uni rpg group. Just random chance that we both ended up putting our names down for the same game. Didn&#039;t exactly ask her out unless you count asking her out for brunch the morning after we slept together. It didn&#039;t last but I did meet my wife as a result, when she introduced us at a party. Since they were so close, I ended up getting to know my wife pretty well and going /out/ with her a few times well before I was in a position to go out with her. <br><br>I&#039;ve only had one gf before either of them that I went /out/ with much and I did get her into /out/ but it&#039;s not like there&#039;s some trick to it. We met at a Model UN camp in high school and she lived interstate. When she first visited, I was nervous about her getting bored and self-conscious about my family being fucking poor so I took her camping. She had a good time. We continued dating as undergrads and since we were still living in different states there wasn&#039;t that much of a difference between one of us flying interstate to visit the other vs both of us flying/driving interstate/overseas and making a trip out of it.",

If anyone has experience doing that: do you have a huge backpack or something?</span><br>I do that all the time with my bike, typically I get groceries for four days to a week.<br>I carry it with a 10 liter backpack (I think, I don&#039;t remember how much it carries but it does the job) and a bag attached to the rear luggage rack. I haven&#039;t needed a second bag. I have a basket I can strap to the rack as well but it&#039;s pretty sketchy. Only use it when I need to get laundry cleaning products, floor cleaner, that kind of stuff that comes in larger bottles.<br>Having bags to attach to my bicycle just unlocked a level of convenience in my life I just didn&#039;t suspect. I don&#039;t like driving and if I leave my spot close to my home there&#039;s no guarantee I&#039;ll find something nearby when I come back so I might lose ten minutes just trying to park, so I&#039;d usually put off the big grocery run and instead do quick hops to grab small hauls. With the ability to carry more on my bike, everything just became a lot easier. <br>You can probably just use one backpack, I just like to separate &quot;dry groceries&quot; and &quot;cold groceries&quot; that will get &quot;wet&quot; because of condensations. Keep the dry bags of rice and the cold stuff separate.<br>Also, get a kickstand. It&#039;s handy when you&#039;re loading and unloading your bike.",

I already did the most difficult part, after doubling one time and yesterday doing one and a half I&#039;m between stages 5 and 6. In this place I have access to the road.<br>The thing is that at the beginning of the second day I started developing really bad blisters. I never had blisters like that, even though I&#039;m really prone to blisters so I have a shit ton of medikit for that. But they are huge and in the sole of the foot. Yesterday I started using compeed but apparently it&#039;s super infected and compeed only worse the infection.<br><br>I&#039;m so frustrated cause I already did the hardest part, and since I&#039;m carrying all the food I was way heavier than before, so everyday should be easier. But the blisters are fucking me up. Everybody said that the part nord was the hardest one, that it was very technical. But I found it normal, I feel like physically I&#039;m super fine and if I didn&#039;t had blisters I could easily double every day without effort. But I just can&#039;t handle the blisters. And it&#039;s getting worse and worse.<br>I think I will take a day off here, someone gave me eozine (Betadine) and I took off the compeel to dry them, do you think that a day off could help. I don&#039;t mind the mild blisters I can deal with them. But the ones in the sole of the foot are just terrible. I&#039;m being a baby?<br>The other problem is that for today and the following days there are going to be thunderstorm after 2pm. And apparently the weather in Corse is super dangerous. So I was thinking before in walking everyday all I can and doing bivouac mid journey if I can&#039;t take it, but that&#039;s impossible with the thunderstorms since I have to arrive to every refuge before 2. And I don&#039;t trust in my speed since I&#039;m going super slow due to the blisters.<br>I will post pics in the next posts.<br>(1/?)",

Next time you go trekking just wear broken-in normal tennies, you can replace the insole before heading out if its worn. In all honesty running shoes make an ideal trail hiking shoe. It&#039;s way more important to have a light comfortable shoe that dries quickly than something super rugged. If you&#039;re hunting in late Fall, bush whacking in the desert, or occasionally post holing in snow that&#039;s when you want a rugged boot, but if you&#039;re just trail hiking and crossing a creek every now and then... just use a running shoe.",

Your body will probably fight the infection and you probably can get to care if you start to get symptoms, but its just a risk is all. Infection can get bad before symptoms present or it could take a lot longer to get to care than you think. And since continuing on means not letting these heal they can continue to get more infected, especially if you dont have antibiotic ointment and some kind of sterile dressing to protect them. I know its not what you want to hear and its hard to say without seeing it in person but if i met you out on my job as a forest janny id probably recommend you bail. Dont have to go see a doc, but giving the blisters a chance to heal is the only way to be sure you dont need a doc. The mountains arent going anywhere.",

Next time you get some boots, try a half size up with thicker socks. <br>Luco tape is good for blisters as well. I see you&#039;ve already lanced (popped / stabbed) your blisters, which I highly would not recommend. It creates open wounds prone to infection. On your friction blisters, I recommend aquaphor or Vaseline. If you get the chance, they sell blister specific bandages that look like occlusive dressings that do some medical magic and form sort of padding for your blisters, while being waterproof. <br><br>TL;DR Blisters on the ball of the foot, in my opinion, sounds like poor insoles / socks.

Allowing your foot and shoe to work together instead of against each other is more important by far. Worn in boots are great, and let you be more aggressive about pace and such, but it\u2019s better to have literally anything else if your boots cause you bad blisters. You can climb mountains in thongs or even barefoot, you just have to be more careful, but you can\u2019t hike distance if your shoes are chewing on your feet.",

Always replaced the cans when the &quot;use-before&quot; date was up. The last can, I tried to use for discouraging rats from getting into our parent&#039;s house&#039;s walls. That can, which was about a year away from the best-before date at the time, barely had 30cm or jet instead of the 3-5m it advertised. From other people, I&#039;ve heard similar things. Simply put, the cans lose pressure when they get hot (from excess pressure overcoming the seal) or cold (from the seal shrinking, and no longer staying tight). In practice, that means that carrying them /out/ makes them useless quickly.<br><br>If you&#039;re limited to irritants for whatever reason, get pyrotechnical irritants. Piexon Guardian Angel, JPX Jet Protector, or irritant &quot;blanks&quot; for whatever gun you can carry. My goto is a 9mm RK revolver, for example (with a knife, cause I&#039;m not retarded... The pepper is only for wild animals).<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m scared I&#039;ll get ambushed</span><br>No weapon will protect you from an ambush, unless you&#039;re a. willing to kill everybody who approaches you and b. are only in areas with no cover a sniper could hide behind.<br>But let&#039;s face it, chances are that no one will &quot;ambush and murder&quot; you. Even if someone wants to attack you, they&#039;ll most likely be after money or sex, meaning they&#039;ll come close and try to force you into obeying without killing you (right away, at least). At that point, a knife is most effective, a gun is a close second, and pepperspray is far off, near the end of the list.",

They&#039;re both well known as easy beginner&#039;s peaks that are suitable for someone with no prior mountaineering experience. Mera is essentially a walk, handling the altitude is essentially the only difficulty but assuming you&#039;ve acclimatised properly you&#039;ll probably be fine. Island Peak has a short semi-technical section but it&#039;s simple enough that you don&#039;t need any prior skills, the guides are able to teach what you need to know at base camp.",

The if you get awarded the grant, congratulations you now get to submit progress reports every month for the next 5 years and hire consultants to do the analysis and design. Then some political retard does something that makes the costs of steel and concrete double and your budget projections get fucked so you go get another grant which you&#039;re more likely to get because you leverage the already committed funds from other agencies. So you got another award and you&#039;re back on track but now you&#039;re reporting to different agencies every month and have to keep track of every penny from each grant and which portions of the project it&#039;s funding.

I don&#039;t give a shit how many hunts and hikes they&#039;ve been on at literally 90(actual age of the guy who went missing in one of the documentaries). It&#039;s not a fucking Scooby Doo mystery gang. Old man falls down, animals eat them and drag them away. Not to mention is it also just as if not more likely that people kill others out in the woods because maybe they get an inheritance and can say woops they fell. One of the most effective forms of murder is probably the &quot;lol disappeared in the woods&quot;. Yet retards fucking lap this shit up about fucking aliens and big foot molesting old people.",

You&#039;d be surprised how many drownings occur in a local body of water near you, often accidental. A few cases are weird but honestly weird shit happens in the woods, the Americans woodlands even more so. As an American you can easily wander into someone&#039;s property, get shot and get buried without anyone ever tell the authorities, at least back in the day when nobody gave a shit about anything. A lot of national parks are fucking massive, bigger than entire states and countries. You&#039;d be hard pressed to find the corpse of someone in an area that big. Also, I think that&#039;s also the reason why there are so many deaths: The national parks are just that big. A lot of Americans take for granted how massive those parks are when a lot of countries (such as Europe and Asia) barely have any forests that haven&#039;t been turned into cities that are older than the United States itself, save for maybe a few rural areas.",
