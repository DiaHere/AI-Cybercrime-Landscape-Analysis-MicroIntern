So her hobby is shopping, purchasing shit. She just likes to spend money. Her dopamine comes from browsing and ordering things on amazon. To the extent that she orders things, and FORGETS about them. She loses interest once they arrive. She had a box on from amazon sitting on the counter for weeks because she forgot she even ordered it. So much useless shit in the house that she used once, if ever.<br><br>She bought a bike wanting to go out more and ride around.<br>She put it together, rode it one time. It has been untouched for a year. Turns out she also put the front part of the bike wrong, so I spent a day fixing it. Bike chain is fucked from just sitting outside getting wet in the rain or covered in dust/sunlight all year so thats her excuse to not ride it. She lost all her drive to use it because the idea of buying it and building it was more fun for her. <br><br>She has student loans and some credit card debt. I make $90k a year, she had her own job. It was remote, making a bit over $50k a year. I took care of most of the bills. In that amount of time, despite having less responsibility, she racked up MORE debt with a new car (using us having a kid as the excuse). She didn&#039;t make a single fucking dent in her prior debt. <br><br>I forced her to quit her job for various reasons. Despite us making LESS money now, we are LESS in debt because I started focusing on it and she without income can&#039;t spend, though she still finds ways to NEED new things. Groceries in the fridge ain&#039;t good enough she NEEDS to buy this other thing because she doesn&#039;t want what&#039;s in there etc. I feel like killing her.",

That should sustain me for the worst of whatever midden hits the windmill. Use the current prices for your PM(s) of choice to figure out how many ozt of each or a mix.

Cancelled the shares sure helps out while the plan man is suing the pants off of everyone. It is only after the fraudsters get shooken down do we show up with the amended plan. All shortsellers will get margin called in the premarket. (If you are naked short BBBY you better close your margin accounts and withdraw your money. I&#039;m not even joking, you&#039;ll lose everything. At least if you take the money out you can buy gold and bury it when the lawyers come to take your houses etc)<br><a href=\"#p60675515\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;60675515</a><br>Won&#039;t be much longer now.",

I have never made money consistently; in fact, I don\u2019t even remember withdrawing 2% of what I lost in crypto. I grew tired of watching my monitor at 2 a.m., desperately waiting for a reversal only to wake up to a liquidation. This happened more times than I can remember.<br>the luckiest I ever got was when I managed to grow my portfolio by 80%, only to buy into Ethereum at the worst time possible, when the orange man launched tariffs.<br>In the whole course of trading crypto, I\u2019ve seen it all: pumps and dumps, liquidity grabs, the FTX collapse, the Terra Luna collapse, market maker manipulation. One time, I watched the order book open a 20% gap just to push the market price up and liquidate my short at 3 a.m.<br>what hurt me the most was believing things would get better, and that I\u2019d finally make it. But it only got worse.<br>over time, I became deeply depressed and volatile. My portfolio losses dictated how I treated the people around me and how much trouble I got into. I looked at my portfolio at least 30 times a day, also 30 mood swings a day.<br>and just when I thought things couldn\u2019t get worse\u2026 Bitcoin finally pumped while I was holding a stinky short, after waiting 4 years to time the pump. I thought to myself: I will never make it with crypto convinced by the pain in my chest from all the past losses and the regrets that followed them.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; last time i traded crypto</span><br>one month ago, I decided to liquidate all my positions at a huge loss and permanently quit crypto.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; the replacement </span><br>was a prop firm trading.

Basically asset hub, a common good parachain on DOT, will get solidity smart contracts support using EVM and PVM. This will mean that ANY solidity smart contract will be able to launch without the need to deploy a whole parachain. You&#039;ll simply deploy on asset hub or HUB and it&#039;ll work. The deploy fees will also be VERY SMALL, imagine below 1$ whereas on ETH you literally could be paying anywhere up to 1000$+ if the network is congested. You&#039;ll also be able to use any of the other parachains functionality from HUB. So you&#039;ll be able to launch a solidity smart contract on HUB while using the functionality of ANY other parachain on DOT, while also having access to all the assets on the other chains while also having access to assets on other chains (this is done through Bridge Hub, HyperBridge and SnowBridge integrations)... This is the next big upgrade to DOT, after DOT 2.0 and then after that you&#039;ll get JAM and proof of personhood and individuality and stuff like that.",

A lot of projects that launched on polkadot simply didn&#039;t get off the ground, but they still operate a parachain core that essentially take up a space that could be occupied by a new startup that could get big. Basically the system as it has been, 1 project 1 core and only through a bidding process, artificially constrained this cycling process as it gave inordinate advantage to preexisting projects regardless of success or utilisation. This was a big disadvantage compared to ethereum, avax, IBC chains etc.",

There&#039;s plenty of cores, even for people like Acala... But yea, Acala probably doesn&#039;t need a whole core dedicated to themselves. As you&#039;ve stated, there could be 4 or even more projects per core. 1 core can literally handle well over 1k TPS at this point and once NOMT hits it&#039;ll be over 10k TPS (there has also been other optimizations... so maybe even more)",

Polkadot SDK also provides decentralised sequencers, and the networks work item coordination can dynamically balance load, so can potentially deliver 10k+ tps/subsecond blocks or on the other side only posting blocks when the chain accrues enough tx requests, depending on cores bought, so can deliver both high performance and capital efficiency. Basically it offers maximally decentralised, maximally secure custom performance environments. <br><br>At the moment, eth rollups are underpinned by centralised sequencers and multisigs, with virtually no interop between them, let alone secure. Solana isn&#039;t actually a blockchain, and avalanche uses a sidechain &quot;subnet&quot; architecture that does not provide validation as a service, rather providing a loose lower security network where every chain has to bootstrap their own validator sets.<br><br>All things considered, polkadot is just the most performant of it&#039;s class. Doesn&#039;t make it a magic bullet obviously, projects using less performant platforms succeed just as much. Most blockchain applications don&#039;t require nearly as much capacity as polkadot offers, and most of that capacity is underutilised by dead projects due to the history of poor provisioning systems.",

Peaq, phala, origin trail/neuroweb, energyweb and mythos are all industry leaders who utilise their blockspace well. Most of the successes on polkadot have so far been B2B with little to no consumer side, or have abstracted the wallet/blockchain interface out (mythos with NFA/FIFA Rivals) leaving little space for speculation or money movement on their projects. I would say that Hydration is the only successful user orientated chain, and has become the main defi platform on polkadot. Incidentally it has nearly doubled it&#039;s tvl in the past month, it&#039;s maybe broken into the top 10 dexes by tvl now, hovering around 350m. It took 4 years but there is organic momentum on a user facing app chain on polkadot now. Maybe the hub can tap into that and furthee build momentum.<br><br>Looking back to the 20/21 run, a lot of the most hyped projects crashed or fizzled out. Many have persisted, but haven&#039;t found their PMF. For the past 4 years a lot of them have been posting empty blocks. Those are the real zombies and until now have consumed an outsized proportion of resources.",

There have been issues with asset hub and snowbridge&#039;d tokens being useless. Hopefully the incentivised DOT pools on the ethereum rollups help boost hyperbridges utilisation.",

So what I&#039;m trying to say is that the TVL of the liquid staking product is more important than how many users or tx are being made. Most people just put their DOT into vDOT and then leave it at that. Also I&#039;m not sure if GDOT is treated as 1 user from the side of Bifrost or as multiple users. Bifrost TVL has actually also been going up substantially due to GDOT. The interesting thing is that when I talk to people why they don&#039;t use Bifrost to stake DOT their argument is &quot;It&#039;s not safe. I use the official staking dashboard&quot;... It&#039;s literally like... Things can go wrong on the official staking board too. People refuse to use a better product while they have 0 technical reasons why it&#039;s unsafe. They simply believe it is and when asked why they can&#039;t provide any further clarification outside of &quot;It&#039;s not as safe&quot;... It&#039;s like a industry-wide PTSD from all the things that have gone wrong before... And on top of that people are conditioned to believe that if it&#039;s an OFFICIAL thing that that means it&#039;s &quot;safe&quot; for some reason while Bifrost isn&#039;t even though it&#039;s been running for what? 3 years? 4 years without anything going wrong. And I also always explain that even if something did go wrong you still have openGov which would fix the issue immediately.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There have been issues with asset hub and snowbridge&#039;d tokens being useless</span><br>What do you mean?

You&#039;ll have your DOT wallet and it&#039;ll directly connect to your DOT wallet.

Not sure about the KYC you&#039;ll need to do if you want to get the card though. They&#039;ll probably require some sort of KYC but you can always get around that by finding some random junkie on the street and paying them like 100$ for their ID. So you basically KYC through his data and then if you spend your money it&#039;ll be his ass on the line but it&#039;s not like the authorities will even be able to find a random homeless junkie you found and even if they did it&#039;s not like he&#039;ll remember your face or anything.",

Incidentally it has nearly doubled it&#039;s tvl in the past month, it&#039;s maybe broken into the top 10 dexes by tvl now, hovering around 350m.</span><br>It&#039;s actually #11 according to defillama. Although it&#039;s not listed. https://defillama.com/protocols/dex<wbr>s<br>https://x.com/Capo_Dot_/status/1939<wbr>571303804997772<br>As Capo_Dot points out &quot;With over $200M in TVL already, hitting $500M in the coming weeks or months doesn\u2019t seem far off&quot;. We&#039;ll probably break 500m$ in the coming weeks, we&#039;re literally at 360$m TVL (https://app.hydration.net/stats/ov<wbr>erview). Just the price increase of DOT alone from going from 5$ to 11$ will literally almost double the TVL. We might go over 1B$ in the coming months. This doesn&#039;t even consider that more assets will be added to the omnipool and that the ecosystem is getting more interconnected each day.<br><br>There has also been a new feature launched recently, https://x.com/Capo_Dot_/status/1939<wbr>571303804997772, https://www.deploypolkadot.xyz/. You can now deploy a roll up within minutes.<br><br>We also keep forgetting that once JAM is implemented it&#039;ll be able to LITERALLY host Ethereum and all the ETH rollups, https://x.com/pala_labs/status/1947<wbr>205594961883168. So what I&#039;m saying is that Polkadot will be able to INFINITELY SCALE ETH. So everything will be able to get validated through DOT. And not just that, ANY OTHER CHAIN will also be able to scale directly through Polkadot without needing to do anything to be honest. This is something most people aren&#039;t even considering since it&#039;s still a bit away.",

Gavin wood has stated that he wants blockchain tech to be so easy to access that it no longer makes sense to run private servers, data centres etc., to drive adoption through raw economic pressure. That&#039;s the goal of JAM. If that&#039;s not breaking a glass ceiling, I dunno what is.

They provide faster unstaking for users by taking a percentage of DOT locked for staking by users, and holding it as liquidity, part of the reason why LSTs can&#039;t match the rewards of native staking. If only a few people are unstaking, they can use their pool of DOT to make users whole sooner, knowing that the DOT will be recouped in full eventually. Their ratio of staking:unbonding:liquid is calibrated to suit a 28 day unbond on the backend, but if they no longer have to deal with 28 day unbonding as default, then they can use more of the DOT held as liquidity for staking to closer match native APR, or provide even faster unstaking because their ratio between staking:unbonding:liquid is rebalanced that much faster. Does that make sense? Of course they could also maintain the same ratio to provide the same unbonding time, but for more customers before they have to taper unlocks to match the protocol, but this seems fairly unsexy to me. I imagine they would go the more capital efficient route.",

The whole draw of them allowing assets to be held is that the customers do not have any control over those assets. The majority of customers do not want that responsibility. Meanwhile, the banks will be able to drive yield from the assets, and pay some of that yield back to their customers in the form of an APY. The banks will control the wallets, that&#039;s the whole fucking point. That&#039;s true abstraction.

Sister eventually found out. Drama....but we still fucked regularly.<br>3)the gay brother who was a ladyboy, sucked my dick and swallowed. Fucked him in the ass since he begged for it. Looked a lot like his sisters. 39kg and 5&#039; 2&quot;. Prostate orgasm from being pounded. Pretty cute.<br>4)the 45 yo mom. I had known all of them for about two years at this point and she was well aware of what I was doing to her daughters. I seduced her and came inside of her.<br>5) the 35 yo aunt. I got her pregnant since she lived like 10minutes away and came over every day after he work to fuck and get a creampie. She was surprised she got pregnant (again). I wasn&#039;t. My kid from her is 4 years old now.<br>6) aunt 2. Met me through aunt 1. I fucked her while aunt 1 was in the other room. She knew. Begged me to cum inside of her. Had baby rabies since her sister was pregnant at the time and it was making her jealous.<br><br>Their other brother worked at sea on a ship so I couldn&#039;t get my hands on him. Dad was dead and probably rolling in his grave.",

You want to have SOME financial discipline when IT MAKES sense (i.e. low effort to save money, big ticket items, you don\u2019t need the item right now etc.) but overdoing it is really dumb and most likely making your life less enjoyable. Try to care less and just force yourself to pull the trigger when you need something. Also, don\u2019t try to save too much on things that have a big impact on your life by going for the cheaper option (health, relationships, hobbies that bring you a lot of joy/ fulfilment, productivity etc.).",

Real buys rerouted.<br><br>But something changed last week.<br><br>There\u2019s chatter on the Hill.<br>Staffers are asking questions. Closed-door briefings. Senate finance got wind of it.<br><br>One of my sources (ex-BlackRock, used to engineer Aladdin) says the kill order was reversed. It\u2019s coming all the way from the top. Market makers got the memo. Suppression bots unwinding. OTC desks getting jumpy.<br><br>You\u2019re seeing it already: hidden bids stacking, resistance walls pulling back, volume trickling in from dormant wallets. This is the quiet before ignition.<br><br>Once this breaks containment, it\u2019s over. Floors gone.<br>Ceilings? Doesn\u2019t have one.<br>I can\u2019t say when, but when it pops... it&#039;s going vertical.<br><br>Next 3 months gonna melt faces.<br>You will not have time to react.<br>This is your warning. I\u2019m dead serious.<br>I\u2019m real excited for you guys.",

Personally, I was not convinced.<br>XRP was revolutionary when it came out but since then the competition has gotten quite fierce. <br>- A lot of blockchains offer fast transactions and low transaction costs. - - The concensus mechanism (federated byzantine agreement) is more suited for institutions since it is centralized by design. A centralized ledger is not really attractive to retail and institutions have other solutions to choose from (corda r3, hyperledger, oracle).<br>- The &#039;global liquidity layer&#039; is a pretty cool idea, but seems kind of redundant with interoperability solutions + stablecoins. It would work if everyone got on board with that.<br>- The fee burning is good but extremely slow and it might take years of widespread adoption before it makes a dent in the total supply.<br>- no smart contracts yet<br>Overall it&#039;s a fast and elegant solution but at this market cap, it faces far too much competition for me to make a bet on it.<br><br>Just my 2c",

Chinese small caps like HOLO are especially notorious for doing this. If you ever look at small cap and see shit like &quot;stock offering&quot; in past news or zoom out and see the graph that hits multiple tousands, avoid it like the plague. It means the companies will hype up their stock price, then dilute and bag the money.",

Land-value appraisal doesn&#039;t require access to the Akashic records, you just have to take some basic factors into account (access to amenities, ecology, recently sold plots with similarities, etc.). It&#039;s not anymore complicated than a regular real estate taxes (probably simpler even). And the &quot;overly developed dystopias&quot; you&#039;re talking about sounds like a nignog complaint about muh gentrification.",

Storing abstract economic value in either enables negative sum actors (NSAs) to parasite as negative sum actors can specialize exclusively in force, taking physical goods by force and either coercing TTPs, or using force to BECOME the TTP (the origin of State). Positive sum actors had to either reduce their own production to make time for murdering/imprisoning/exiling NSAs, pay extortion to them, or employ positive sum actors specializing in force (police/military), however, as abstract economic value was seizable, there was a constant selection pressure for these \u201cimmune cells\u201d to turn malignant.<br><br>Hence the cyclic nature of empire/nation growth and decay, positive sum actors build, negative sum actors corrupt and destroy, NSAs are excised &amp; PSAs rebuild from the ashes. As can be seen, PSAs have been at a HUGE disadvantage to NSAs through history, the best \u201csolution\u201d we had come up with pre-BTC was Plato\u2019s Benevolent Philosopher King, a perfectly trustworthy trusted third party, do you have any Benevolent Philosopher Kings lying around? Not a real solution.<br><br>But by placing abstract economic value beyond the veil of voluntarity, positive sum actors can reverse the advantage.

        "com": "While most of crypto is distracted by hype cycles and fleeting trends, Chainlink has quietly been building the infrastructure that will underpin the future of global finance. With the launch of CCIP Chainlink is enabling secure, seamless communication between blockchains, making it the SWIFT of the blockchain era. <br><br>This isn\u2019t a theory: SWIFT itself is working with Chainlink, alongside over a dozen top-tier banks, to bring tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) on-chain. As giants like BlackRock and Citi predict trillions in tokenized assets in the next few years, Chainlink is positioned at the heart of this transformation, offering the essential tools: decentralized data, proof-of-reserve, automation, and interoperability. Staking is live (soon V1.0), supply is shrinking, and enterprise demand is rising, yet LINK price still trades far below its true potential. <br><br>At the center of all this stands Sergey Nazarov, a quiet yet brilliant visionary who continues to deliver real-world adoption without hype or theatrics (like some others). He\u2019s not building the next app: he\u2019s building the next financial internet. <br><br>Chainlink isn\u2019t just surviving the bear market it\u2019s preparing to lead the next era.",

The child kicks, screams, and cries as they drown and are about to be resigned to a watery grave when you walk by. You can save them if you jump into the pool and pull them out. But doing so would come at a cost. You\u2019re currently wearing a very expensive suit\u2014about 5,000 dollars\u2014or perhaps your suit is cheap but has a 5,000 dollar bill in your pocket that would be ruined if you save the child (it\u2019s a very deep pocket\u2014you can\u2019t pull it out in time). Clearly, in such a case, even though it would cost significant money, you\u2019d be obligated to jump into the pond to save the child.<br><br>Long before I was born, Peter Singer argued that this case shows that we have an obligation to donate to effective charities. The best charities\u2014which you can, at any time, donate to\u2014save lives for a few thousand dollars each. Just as you\u2019re obligated to sacrifice a few thousand dollars to pull the child out of the pond and save them, you\u2019re obligated to sacrifice a few thousand dollars to save a far-away child who would otherwise die of malaria.<br><br>In Singer\u2019s original formulation, he used the drowning child case to support the following principle: if you can prevent something very bad from happening without sacrificing anything of comparable moral value, you should do so. For example, if you can prevent a woman from being raped or a person from being murdered at the cost of 700 dollars, you should do so, because averting rape and murder is more valuable than 700 dollars. From this, he deduces that you should give your discretionary spending to effective charities. You shouldn\u2019t spend 5,000 dollars going to Hawaii when you could instead save a person\u2019s life.",

This seems to be the salient feature of the situation\u2014the reason to wade in and save the child seems to be that you can save a life at a small cost. The alternative is to come up with some gerrymandered explanation of why you should save the child from the pond but not from malaria, but that\u2019s less plausible than the simple account that you should prevent terrible things from happening if you can do so at comparatively minor cost.",

Suppose that a child is drowning in a plane and it costs money to press a button that would save them from drowning. Would your reason to save them decrease as they recede into the distance\u2014as they get farther away? Is your obligation to save aliens within one galaxy of you much stronger than your reason to save aliens within two galaxies of you? No, that\u2019s crazy! It doesn\u2019t get less important to save people simply because they\u2019ve taken planes far away.<br><br>When claiming that proximity refutes the drowning child argument, lots of people like to say is that you have a great obligation to your friends and family. I don\u2019t know what prompts them to say this in response to the drowning child argument, as it has nothing to do with the argument! Even if you have special obligations to your friends and family, your reasons to save drowning children that you don\u2019t know are still equal to your reasons to save kids you don\u2019t know who might get malaria. The drowning child is not your child\u2014they\u2019re a child that you don\u2019t know personally.<br><br>People often claim that you have a greater obligation to those in your own country than to foreigners. I\u2019m doubtful of this, but let\u2019s grant it. Now imagine that you\u2019re on the Mexican border and see a drowning child. They\u2019re not a member of your country. Nevertheless, you should wade in the pond and save them, even at the cost of an expensive suit. Failing to give to effective charities, I claim, is like ignoring the drowning Mexican child\u2014even though they\u2019re not part of your country, you still have an obligation to save them.",

I\u2019ve always found this idea super weird: your reason to save people doesn\u2019t evaporate just because other people aren\u2019t following their duty to save people. We can see this by imagining in the drowning children that there are a bunch of nearby assholes ignoring the child as he drowns. Does that eliminate your reason to save the child? No, obviously not. But this case is, in terms of other people not acting to save the child, analogous to real-world charitable donations.<br><br>The final consideration\u2014and this one is the only that bears any weight\u2014is that there are many drowning children. Imagine that there wasn\u2019t just one drowning child, but hundreds of thousands\u2014you could never save them all. It\u2019s plausible that you wouldn\u2019t be obligated to spend your entire life saving children, never enjoying things.<br><br>The main thing to note about this is that even if it\u2019s right, maybe it means we\u2019re not all required to spend all of our time saving children, but it still means we\u2019re required to do a lot. A person who never saved even a single drowning child, who ignored the cries of every child who drowned, would be monstrous. So while perhaps you don\u2019t have to give all your money to effective charities, accepting this reasoning would still mean you have an obligation to make charitable giving a main part of your life\u2014say by giving a significant share of your income to effective charities.",

In a world where kids were constantly drowning, it doesn\u2019t seem justified to, say, spend thousands of dollars on vacation when you could instead save a child. A child\u2019s life is just so much more important than a trip to Europe. Your reason to save a child doesn\u2019t depend on how many previous children you\u2019ve saved\u2014or so it seems. If I can\u2019t remember whether I lost 10,000 dollars yesterday saving drowning children or gambling, it doesn\u2019t seem I need to figure out which of these I did to decide whether I should save a drowning child.<br><br>But if we accept this principle, that whether you previously spent your money on saving children or doing other stuff doesn\u2019t affect whether you should currently spend your money on saving children, then your reason to save children is the same as it would be if you hadn\u2019t saved any children. But clearly, if you were choosing between saving a child from a pond and going on vacation, and you hadn\u2019t saved any children, you\u2019d be obligated to save the child. It follows then that you have an obligation to save a child if the alternative is going on vacation.<br><br>This argument has, since I\u2019ve heard it, struck me as obviously, irrefutably correct. We certainly have an obligation to make saving children\u2014when we can save hundreds at comparatively minor cost\u2014a significant life project. If a person can save a life a year, without majorly jeopardizing their welfare, just by tithing to effective charities, failing to do so seems clearly immoral.<br><br>If you\u2019re convinced by this, I\u2019d encourage you to take a Giving What We Can pledge or give to GiveWell charities. Most people are, inadvertently, doing things as bad as walking past drowning children. We have significant reason to stop doing this.",

But I don\u2019t think this is some troubling feature unique to utilitarianism. It\u2019s follows automatically once one has even a modicum of empathy for animals. Once one does not arbitrarily discount the interests of animals entirely, the moral urgency of animal welfare becomes clear.<br><br>John Rawls famously proposed a procedure to evaluate the importance of the world\u2019s issues impartially and without bias. The proposal: imagine making decisions behind a veil of ignorance, unsure which of the affected parties you are. For instance, suppose Jeffrey Dahmer is deciding whether he should kill and eat people. Well, if he wasn\u2019t sure whether he was the one who would be doing the eating or the one being eaten, he obviously wouldn\u2019t support the killing and eating. No one in their right mind would take a 1/2 chance of being killed and eaten for a 1/2 chance of deriving whatever benefit Dahmer got from cannibalism.<br><br>In short, the veil of ignorance makes sure your decisions are impartial. It\u2019s very easy to be biased to overrate problems that affect you. By imagining you don\u2019t know who you are, you can no longer tilt the scales in favor of problems that affect you. You must include everyone behind the veil\u2014a white person couldn\u2019t justify anti-black racism by arbitrarily excluding black people from the pool of possible identities. You have to count everyone\u2019s interests.",

It requires you be impartial\u2014but perhaps you get to be partial towards your loved ones. Perhaps you get to save a family member over two strangers, even if you\u2019d save the two strangers from behind the veil of ignorance. (The veil of ignorance also seems to imply on its face that you shouldn\u2019t care about bringing people into existence if they have below-average happiness, but that\u2019s easily fixed by including possible people behind the veil.)<br><br>But even if this is right, the veil of ignorance is a decent guide to deciding which things are important. If you\u2019d care overwhelmingly about an issue behind the veil of ignorance, then the issue is quite important, and you should take it rather seriously. The veil of ignorance tells us which things impartially matter, and any plausible ethical view takes seriously the things that matter impartially\u2014even if bringing about impartial value doesn\u2019t exhaust all of ethics.<br><br><br>But when we apply the veil of ignorance to animals, it becomes obvious that animal welfare is by far the most important issue in the world.<br><br>A first thing one notices when they imagine they\u2019re equally likely to be any of the conscious creatures ever born is that the odds they\u2019ll be a human are very low. It\u2019s about 600 times more likely that you\u2019d be born this year as a chicken in a factory farm than a human. In fact, the odds you\u2019d be born as a chicken in a factory farm this year are about as high as the odds you\u2019d be born as a human ever, in all of history up until this point. Approached this way, caring about chicken farming doesn\u2019t seem like some weird obsession of utilitarians. Behind the veil of ignorance, we\u2019d all care about it. Our concern about chicken farming alone could very well dwarf our concern about all human problems.",

Once I am in profit I will do something like buy 10k xrp on a dip and then set 5 sells for 1k each every .02 up that way I scrape some profit and keep some extra position. Even if it nukes my stop loss is so far in profit it doesn&#039;t matter and I have spot buys on the way down really after I scrape the 1k in profit it&#039;s all house money after that anyways.",

But instead of a clear rally, we crabbed sideways\u2014mainly because the Fed didn\u2019t cut rates, and then tariffs added more macro pressure.<br><br>Most of the new money came through Bitcoin ETFs, so BTC outperformed while altcoins barely moved. Now, suddenly, alts are starting to show signs of life\u2014but most are still far below their former all-time highs. At the same time, sentiment is fragile. People are still traumatized from previous cycles and are worried that this sudden alt action might signal the top is near. If BTC drops, alts will likely crash again.<br><br>Consensus still says the top should come sometime in fall or winter 2025. But the Fed complicates things. If rate cuts don\u2019t come until Q1 2026\u2014and Powell possibly gets replaced\u2014it could change the cycle structure. Without liquidity, we might not pump as hard in late 2025. But without a blow-off top, we also might not crash as hard in 2026.<br><br>So now the big question is:<br>Will the cycle extend into 2026?<br>Will we get a double top (2025 and 2026)?<br>Or is this just a weird, flattened version of the usual bull run?",

The exact reason for this is explained in this Ethereum Foundation blog post(opens in a new tab). Since finality requires a two-thirds majority, an attacker could prevent the network from reaching finality by voting with one-third of the total stake. There is a mechanism to defend against this: the inactivity leak(opens in a new tab). This activates whenever the chain fails to finalize for more than four epochs. The inactivity leak bleeds away the staked ETH from validators voting against the majority, allowing the majority to regain a two-thirds majority and finalize the chain.<br>-----------------------<br>so any ETH can be expropriated by the only 51%+ validator who is Vitalik_and_foundation",

Ethereum launched with 12 million ETH given to the developers and 60 million ETH sold sold for BTC as a part of its &quot;initial coin offering&quot; during the presale. The Ethereum developers purposely misled investors by suggesting that there was merely a 12 million ETH premine and ignoring the 60 million ETH that they sold during the presale, misleading total supply graphs in their prospectus. This is a serious concern in light of Ripple getting sued by the SEC due to XRP being an illegal security, which means in due time we should expect the SEC to also go after Ethereum developers and the Ethereum foundation for creating and selling an illegal security (ETH is a security because it passes the Howey Test).<br><br>https://i.imgur.com/HpBR7C5.mp4<br>Here is a clip of the co-founder of Ethereum, Joseph Lubin, describing how they allowed whales to use multiple fake identities to buy as much ETH as they wanted during the Ethereum presale. &quot;A person can buy with any number of different identities. We may limit the unit size of a single sale to make it easier to disguise. So that nobody scares people with an enormous initial purchase. If you are a whale and you plan on investing several million US dollars worth, then you can do so with with multiple identities.&quot;",

When mrs. piggle wiggle was broke and needed money for food, she and some kids would tear the place apart and find coins hidden behind drawers, behind pictures hung on the wall, etc. This was probably my first exposure to stacking and why I probably have the urge to hide my stack in pieces around the house, in case one store is found, it&#039;s okay, there&#039;s more somewhere else. <br>also, PVC underground is decent idea. Hollowed out 2x4 used as structural beam, not just laying around is also a decent idea. Squirrels don&#039;t plant their nuts in just one spot.",

        "com": "Welcome to the /XMR/ Monero General, dedicated to the discussion of the world&#039;s most widely adopted privacy coin.<br><br>Monero payments are anonymous, low-fee by design and fully fungible, meaning users can send XMR globally without issue and receive XMR without having to worry about tainted coins. Battle-tested privacy tech (Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses and RingCT) ensures that critical TX data cannot be gleaned from the Monero blockchain. Thus by default, the TX history of all Monero users is kept hidden from the prying eyes of adversaries, with TXs being optionally transparent via the aid of a view key.<br><br>Monero algorithmically ensures low TX fees by employing a dynamic (elastic) block size that can &quot;stretch&quot; to easily accommodate sudden TX spikes.<br><br>Monero&#039;s bespoke mining algorithm, RandomX, is optimized for devices using general-purpose CPUs e.g. desktops, laptops, smartphones, tablets, keeping the barrier to entry low and ASICs out of the equation.<br><br>Monero&#039;s tail emission - 0.6 XMR every block forever - financially incentives for-profit miners to keep mining, helping boost long-term network security. This constant linear inflation asymptotically trends to zero and is offset somewhat by a steady rate of coin loss.<br><br>Monero has thus far proven to be the only altcoin capable of overcoming BTC&#039;s network effect by driving it out of the darknet economy BTC dominated for over 10 years. Monero is now also starting to overtake BTC in clearnet commerce as well.

There&#039;s no pool admin that can control what your hashrate is used for or decide who can mine on the pool and who can&#039;t. It&#039;s permissionless!<br><br>Decentralized pool mining (P2Pool) is pretty much the ultimate way to secure a PoW coin against 51% attacks. Once P2Pool reaches &amp; maintains 51%+ of the total network hashrate, Monero will be essentially invulnerable to such attacks.<br><br>Although many inexperienced miners think that bigger pools give better profits, this is absolutely NOT the case.

XMR amounts larger than a few hundred dollars worth should not be stored on a hot wallet for obvious reasons. So ideally, you&#039;ll want to direct all payments/donations to your cold wallet by default and then transfer smaller amounts over to your hot wallet as necessary.<br><br>Relying on 3rd party hardware wallets comes with certain security caveats so they are not recommended. Instead, its surprisingly easy to engineer a very robust storage solution yourself using readily available hardware: a laptop and a smartphone.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Laptop</span><br><br>This will be running Featherwallet and must be *permanently* disabled from ever connecting to the internet again! That means physically removing the M.2 Bluetooth/Wi-Fi card and gumming up the ethernet port with superglue.<br><br>OS should be Linux rather than Windows, preferably a Debian-based lightweight distro. Encrypting the relevant user directory with LUKS is recommended but not essential.<br><br>It must have a functional webcam.<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Smartphone</span><br><br>This can be your primary device. It will host both your hot wallet e.g. Cake, Monerujo, etc and the NERO view-only wallet that is paired with your laptop.<br><br>To set everything up: https://4rkal.com/posts/feathernero<wbr>/<br><br>NOTE: if you don&#039;t have a laptop you can use another smartphone and install the ANON wallet onto it, its essentially the same thing but with somewhat weaker security guarantees. Video guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJq<wbr>YzZyqyno<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In a nutshell</span><br><br>- you accept all (substantial) payments to your cold wallet.<br>- you monitor incoming payments on NERO.<br>- you initiate the transfer of funds from your cold wallet to hot wallet on NERO and sign the TX on your laptop via QR codes.<br>- you spend the funds and help grow the XMR economy.<br><br><br>FYI this is the most secure storage solution currently available.",

Buying and holding Monero is a completely legitimate way to participate in the protocol and we encourage you to save your wealth in XMR.<br><br>XMR is THE best store of value in the world. Not only is it highly scarce, it is entirely untraceable by any third party. No other store of value, including Bitcoin, provides the ability to anonymously hold your wealth anywhere in the world. Armed with only your seed phrase, you can literally take your private bank account anywhere without the consent or permission of anyone. It is like having an invisible stockpile of gold only you know about.<br><br>Privacy will be increasingly rare in the coming years, but the supply of Monero will barely increase. Many people understand that Monero represents the most undervalued asset in the world.",

He actively pushes all potential holders of Monero away unless they agree with only using XMR in bartering scenarios. He will use straw manning tactics against anyone who advocates for saving their wealth in XMR. Anyone suggesting that Monero can preserve and hide their wealth will be called a &quot;grifter&quot;, &quot;moonfag&quot;, or any of several other slurs intended to end the conversation.<br><br>These tactics support the state apparatus directly by denying Monero the notoriety it deserves. Widespread use of Monero, especially through wealth preservation, starves the state of key financial information and tax farming. Pretending there is only one &quot;legitimate&quot; use of Monero (bake sales at Porcfest) while shunning any other uses foments fake division, a favorite strategy of the intelligence community.<br><br>Remember that many authors (W.R. Mogg, The Sovereign Individual) predict that states will get increasingly &quot;nasty&quot; as private currencies threaten their power of surveillance. This author has strategically installed himself as the self-appointed &quot;leader&quot; of Monero on this board, but has no such authority to tell you how to use the best currency ever invented.",

Large or unusual wires, especially multiple just-under thresholds can still trigger scrutiny. So no, there&#039;s no &quot;free pass&quot; for wires, you just fall under different oversight thresholds and rules.<br><br>So if you need to be sure, the safer route is buying something with XMR that you can easily flip for cash on Craigslist or whatever. Really all depends on what sums we&#039;re talking about here.",

You also need a plausible explanation if the bank calls and asks about the nature of account activity and if they don&#039;t like or believe what you&#039;re telling them, they&#039;ll file a suspicious activity report. Honestly, just avoid dealing with banks altogether if possible. Spend crypto directly where possible or,buy gift cards and cash out when necessary. It takes some getting used to but it is doable.",

That\u2019s exactly what a fed would do with a crypto currency that ACTUALLY poses a threat to the state apparatus. And I will not let you fucking succeed.",

Basically introducing XMR into the wider shadow economy, right now its limited to mostly just darknet drug markets and a couple of clearnet grey markets. The room for growth here is immense, the global shadow economy is fucking HUGE ($12 trillion market) with tens of millions of customers going shopping every day.

It&#039;s going to take a minute and require a LOT of hard work and marketing but the payoff would be priceless: the freedom to buy and sell whatever you want with impunity and no taxation + very juicy profits for the early adopters.",

But HOW that happens will determine how much actual exit liquidity is going to be available to YOU. What good is a jacked up XMR price if you can never realize those gains in full because the exit liquidity is dependent on a limited number of HODLtards in a world of growing crypto skepticism? Artificially pumping an asset is relatively easy, memecoin scammers do it all the time. Its realizing the gains in full that is the actual challenge, just ask the average memecoin baggie. Moonfags never consider this, they just obsess about the price.<br><br>The only plausible way to secure sufficient and, crucially, permissionless exit liquidity for our small cabal of early XMR bagholders is to siphon it out of the shadow economy, to tap into summa dat dere $12 trillion cash flows. But that takes time, hard work and patience, no way around it, there&#039;s no free lunch in life. But its also what makes it plausible: productivity = wealth, work hard -&gt; make money.<br><br>Moonfagging on social media, on the other hand, spamming &quot;$10K XMR SOON HODL WAGMI&quot; produces nothing of value and only yields more moonfagging while alienating everybody else that reads the news and knows how scummy and scammy crypto evangelists typically are. And in the post-Trumpcoin era, that&#039;s virtually everybody in the developed world.<br><br>Which is why most generational wealth salesmen get nowhere. Imagine a total stranger knocking on your front door offering to help you get rich. That&#039;s you shilling XMR as an investment to an average normie.",

A tradfi Swiss bank account is a TRADFI Swiss bank account. Yeah, it lacks the anonymity of XMR but it is fully integrated into the formal economy, which contains virtually all of the goods &amp; services your average normie will ever want or need. Spending is seamless and easy.<br><br>Conversely, XMR has anonymity but is unfortunately shut out of that formal economy (not fully yet but we&#039;re headed there). And what is your average normie likely going to do with an XMR savings account? He&#039;s eventually going to want to convert it back into fiat so he can go shopping in primarily the formal economy. But now there&#039;s no more CEXs accepting Monero, its been universally delisted! Now your average normie has to jump through myriad pain-in-the-ass hoops in the hopes of somehow getting their wealth out and ending up with spendable fiat. So why even bother with XMR in the first place?! SoV? Its not like there aren&#039;t already a shitload of tradfi SoV options already available, all seamlessly integrated with the formal economy.<br><br>Which is why shilling XMR as a Swiss bank account/SoV specifically to normies is kinda myopic, at least for as long as the formal economy mogs the counter-economy.<br><br>But shilling the counter-economy to normies is much more straightforward: do the same amount of work, earn more. Buy the same item, pay less.<br><br>In other words, it is infinitely easier to entice normies to regularly buy smaller amounts of XMR and go shopping for contraband/cheapies than it is to convince normies to buy and HODL larger amounts of XMR as a saving/SoV vehicle.<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SAEV wealth in Monero</span><br><br>Again, there&#039;s no plausible reason for normies to be stashing their life savings in XMR since converting it back to fiat will become evermore difficult in future as Monero is upgraded to Enemy of the State status.",

The caffeine launch is a fakeout as they onboarded maybe a dozen people to the alpha. They dropped like 3 keys on X today. I&#039;m not sure what they are afraid of. An open beta has not even been announced yet. It looks like the hackathon from this week did not even make a blip on cycle burn rate which is the most important metric. Nobody is buying or mining BOB right now, which drove ~70% of burn for the past year or so. CBR is direct correlated with a price floor for ICP. <br><br>Dominic is an excellent Chief Scientist but he is an AWFUL public speaker, and it showed in a really bad way this week. He needs professional coaching if he is to summon the spirit of Steve Jobs on stage. He looks and sounds like an autistic sperg showing slide after slide.",

It did have some issues - the UI screen would flicker and the model would get stuck in some kind of feedback loop - but refreshing the page seemed to kick it out of this cycle. I think the guys working upstairs had it patched by the end of day. The developers from dfinity that I spoke to all seemed to believe in the vision. They were working hard and were passionate about the project. One thing that seemed a little strange to me was that they didn&#039;t mention ICP very much, the focus was primarily on caffeine. I might be schizo, but they almost seemed like they were trying to distance themselves from the ICP brand. <br>The price action of the coin does suck ass, I&#039;ve got nothing good to say about that.

You could not question these people. There was a nigress artist, Candace something. I started to do these gay ass twitter spaces with other ICP cult members. This woman was a black israelite who was literally demon possesed. Look at her art if you don&#039;t believe me. Candace... M something. It had a bunch of butterflies. Can&#039;t remember. She had a contract do paint the offices in Dfinity. Dom was going through some strange divorce at the time and in his haze of anti depressants started to have a penchant for this nigress. I got close to it. Too close. Egido and I were enroute to the Bahamas to do a documentary when our apartment was burgalrized and I was roofied. I was in a club with a GIGANTIC black tranny, like 6 foot 5. Tranny came out of nowhere.Then I blacked out. Wound up back in the apartment with the door open. The camera guy had his passport stolen. and I was suffering the come downs of a roofie od. I thought Egido was trying to kill me and caught a plane to the Bahamas. <br><br>Egido Val, despite being a schizo, was giving so much into those projects. I was too. Traveling, making things. We got rugged by that fat grifter bitboy on purpose to expose him but ICP is so dead it&#039;s impossible. If we had done those projects on Solana it would have been much better. The WAGMI Shit was fun, the OGMedals and Chilean coke fiend was fun. <br><br>But everything is scamming from the top. ICP is a literal scam. We can make money on the NFTs.

A wise developer once told me that the best server to host your app on was an old computer sitting under a desk somewhere. This is not an option for ICP devs. Dfinity plan to remediate is to subsidize through programs like grants, ICP Hubs (huge waste of money), and now, the ICP Alliance (seems to be put on hold).

When you do this, you intuit that the costs are much higher compared to traditional cloud infra. <br><br>It costs $0.43 to store 1GB of data for 1 month on the IC Blockchain. For comparison, that is is about 20 times more expensive than Amazon S3, which costs $0.02 for 1GB per month.<br><br>It costs $0.28 to transfer 1 GB of data inter-canister (internally) on the IC Blockchain. For comparison, it costs $0.02 per gigabyte for an Inter-Region transfer on AWS, making ICP 14 times more expensive for moving data around globally. By the way intra-regional transfers on AWS are FREE!<br><br>HTTP outcalls on ICP are perhaps the most ludicrous expense. The request body is limited to 2MB length, as is the response body. So if you were being perfectly efficient with your data transfer off ICP you could transfer out 1 GB of egress data along with a maximum ingress of 1 GB of data with 512 HTTP outcalls. The cost of this is $0.27. For comparison, AWS charges nothing for ingress and $0.09 for egress. Forcing devs to pay to bring data on to the IC is a possible fatal flaw.",

Costs are much higher than web2 but not &quot;infinitely&quot; so\u2014hyperbole aside, the gap is clear.<br>Subjective:<br>Opinions like &quot;huge waste of money&quot; (ICP Hubs) or &quot;ludicrous expense&quot; (HTTP outcalls) depend on perspective, but the data supports cost-related frustration.<br>Broader Context<br>While ICP\u2019s costs are significantly higher than web2 options like AWS, it offers unique benefits\u2014decentralization, security, and potential token incentives\u2014that might justify the expense for specific use cases (e.g., blockchain apps). However, for cost-sensitive developers, these prices could indeed be a barrier.<br><br>In conclusion, your query\u2019s claims are mostly true, backed by the cost comparisons and structural differences outlined, though tempered by slight exaggerations and the need to weigh ICP\u2019s unique advantages.",

There&#039;s 0 reason to have so many employees upfront, why do you need 300 people working on a project right from the jump, what is this a government agency or something? Are these guys feeding their village? Employees are for established companies making money. <br><br>Also you can freeze staking and unlock the tokens somehow or some shit, idk. This would cause a massive pump actually because the market would see any effort at this point from Dfinity to address token performance as positive. Again staking is for established companies or networks. It&#039;s basically like a dividend system. You ever hear of unestablished companies paying out dividends? Offering staking up front is one of the stupidest fucking things a company can do, it just kills all token growth and in this case way more so because the cocksuckers gave millions of tokens away for 3 cents a pop and if only a few VC whales staked some of their coins which they most certainly did / are then you have constant dumping and sell pressure from these assholes.<br><br>And obviously removing the bullshit reverse gas model would be good too because that way the users and not the fucking devs pay for gas. Making devs pay for gas is so fucking dumb. Who thought of all this shit? What&#039;s my incentive as a dev to pay a bunch of gas to start building on some ghost chain? Nothing. This shit can come later when you actually have an ecosystem and devs are getting a return on their investment. Users paying for gas is a fantastic way to increase the burn rate and increase demand for the coin. These dumb fucks have literally done everything to put sell pressure on the coin, this team is literally retarded",

That&#039;s the primary reason I&#039;m willing to baghold. 90% of the price action at this point seems to be from outside influence rather than the actual reality of icp. I bagheld it down from my first buys over $200 and accumulated about 3k icp at average of $8. Held it through the pumps up to $20 but i didn&#039;t throw away the longterm hold position expecting it to atleast hit 40 at some point. At this point if it hits $15 I&#039;ll probably sell 1k of them but going to keep a suicide stack at least. It&#039;s been a painful hold but in the grand scheme of things plenty of more retarded things have happened and I got a nice stack of bitcoin and other alts that have performed well enough for me not to lose sleep over it",

If you have to get vetted to run a node, there&#039;s a pretty low chance that you&#039;ll try to cheat the network - Dfinity will have their hand up your ass, doxxes you, etc. However, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s entirely meaningless either. IIRC ICP has a Nakamoto coefficient of ~30 against Ethereums&#039; 3 or 4, and geological diversity on top of that. Outside of the discussion around bad actors, fault tolerance is still important for applications that would cause big issues if they were knocked offline. Dom and others have stated that one of the selling points of building BFT systems into the network is to counter cybercrime and not rely on AWS. Solana has experienced outages (iirc their validator nodes are heavily centralized on amazon servers, so when that goes down the network goes down), but ICP has not. It&#039;s done well at cutting out dependencies that many other blockchains have - AWS, Cloud, etc, and still remaining resilient and fault tolerant. The only remaining real dependency is Dfinity itself, that&#039;ll I&#039;ll agree with. I would like to see how the network will run if Dfinity were entirely absent. But yeah end of the day you sound like a decentralization maxi, and I salute you for that, but I think it blinds you to the advantages that decentralization can bring outside of your maxi standards.",

Unironically buy a half decent mic and do niche horror stuff. Somewhat obscure true crime narrations (you can find interesting cases every other day since the world is so fucked), 4chan weird/obscure stories, etc. As long as it&#039;s not very well known shit, you&#039;re good. Every channel I see that uploads content like that always gets at WORST fairly decent views. Then you can make 2-3 hour long compilations with all your videos and that&#039;s when you get a real chance at getting a bunch of people all at once, schedule the video for a few hours (boosts performance a little), launch it. Long videos perform well on YouTube because they reward watcher retention.<br>I&#039;d do it if my waggie didn&#039;t drain me like it does.<br><a href=\"#p60673743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;60673743</a><br>What do you upload?

My oldest memories from my grandparents at the farm are my granma drowning the litter of kittens from her pussy in a bucket full of water (because no need for more than one cat to get rid of the rats) then feeding the pigs with it, and my gramp bonking his old sick dog -that he loved more than most humans- on the head with a shovel then burying him in the forest.<br>That&#039;s how we did for millenias. It wasn&#039;t cruel, it&#039;s how we have done it as humans since we domesticated animals. Resources are precious, more precious than life. Only in a decadent society designed around wasting resources we think about such vanities. It&#039;s incredibly egoistic &amp; deranged to waste 50K for an old dog.",

You&#039;ll still make money but risky timing, it does look like its painting a bullflag but it&#039;ll probably only breakout next month, I think the bottom of this dip will be in 10 - 14 days somewhere. The other factor is, everyones calling for the crypto market top in Q4, which I agree with but could be THE golden bullrun which goes into next year given the regulatory aspects finally moving. With that said, I think it&#039;ll be next run that HBAR prints millionaires, not this one. Anywhere between $1 - 3 this run, but anything under $2 will be a lackluster top imho, we&#039;ll go into price discovery, pull an ADA and hit a $90B - 120B mcap but that&#039;s just my opinion. Realistically it&#039;ll go to $1.50 but that&#039;d be bullshit considering a scam like ADA ripped in 2021. I&#039;m still gunna sell the top and quadruple my stack in Q4 of 2026.<br>If I was in your position, I&#039;d buy a 10k stack just so you don&#039;t kill yourself, but put a good portion of your funds into DOVU since it&#039;s practically a microcap with a lot more room to grow. HBAR will still crash like everything else in the bear, a lot of big players are loading up OTC and will wanna fleece retail this run still. Thank you for listening to my coked out ramblings.",

Only BTC has been recognized and adopted, and that was only last year, how long did that take? ETH and its coins like AAVE are the only coins that have a purpose and thats a small sector of crypto primarily used by retail. Everything else after ETH that had &#039;utility&#039; like FTM, LUNA and AXS ate shit deservedly by nobodys that wanted to fleece retail in the unregulated landscape. Look at how quickly BSC went from the leading degen casino to irrelevance cause SOL got picked up by a bunch of suits and jews because its a moneyprinter. You can use the &#039;governing council is a meme&#039; fud all you want, there is a lot of shit going on with Hedera behind the scenes, nobody on biz brings it up or talks about it, every rumour and news piece for LINK and XRP gets mentioned here, but any other crypto? Nope. It took 16 years for BTC to be adopted by tradfi, and now we got the government talking about numerous crypto ETFs. Its exponential now, and very deliberate so they can rope retail in. You believe HBAR is a vapourwave scam, it very well could be, but a handful of cryptos will win, and HBAR is my bet. SOL is a great example of this, nobody had any clue it&#039;d be revived the way it has, everything was behind closed doors. HBAR can be a pump and dump for all I care, but what I do know is it&#039;ll print a shitload of money If you don&#039;t marry your bags and sell at ATH. Retail will lose their minds once they know who is on Hedera&#039;s governing council alone, just like Doge became king memecoin. I&#039;m a retarded normie but I understand how most people think, this is the way it&#039;ll go regardless if Hedera is legit or not. We are all here to make money and not get rugged by another LUNA fiasco.",
