        "com": "Is there an ideal weight loss diet? I imagine most of us here that are overweight are overweight for similar reasons, due to the standard American diet. I&#039;m going insane and I&#039;m just sick of being fat. I&#039;ve always been a little chubby or skinny fat, but I&#039;ve been legitimately obese per BMI calculator for probably around 7 or 10 years now. Every now and then I can lose 10, 20, or 30lbs but I eventually gain it all back. It&#039;s just so annoying because I basically only eat twice a day plus I&#039;ll have a glass of milk at night. I don&#039;t even feel like I eat that much. <br><br>Right now my plan is just to do strict carnivore even though I hate it and won&#039;t do it forever. I did carnivore back in January and lost 20lbs in about 3 weeks then I stopped because I found it unbearable. That being said, I&#039;ve eaten whatever I&#039;ve wanted to since then and only gained 10lbs back, so I think if I lost a ton of weight I could actually keep it off this time. <br><br>I&#039;m thinking about just doing carnivore for like 3-4 months instead of 3-4 weeks and seeing if I can lose 80lbs+. I&#039;m currently 6&#039;2&quot; 270lbs and I want to get down to under 200lbs if possible. I don&#039;t want to count calories and meal prep all my food all week long and use a calculator, I just want to not be fat. <br><br>I&#039;ve also heard of the snake juice diet but that seems a bit more extreme. I&#039;m also very interested in the ray peat dietary philosophy but it doesn&#039;t seem ideal for losing weight. Basically I&#039;d like to do carnivore for massive weight loss, and then shift to a more ray peat based approach for overall health. Thoughts?<br><br>pic related - kinda my body type rn",

You need a few carbs to not hate living and you need the fat for cellular functions. Eat a max of 2-2.5k calories a day. There&#039;s no need to go crazy with 1k or less calories a day.<br>I&#039;d suggest trying 23 hour fasting in the morning. I&#039;ve been doing that somewhat recently and I find it&#039;s easiest for meal management while still keeping energy decent. Whatever you do, don&#039;t fast refeed before bed because you&#039;ll get fat; I learned that the hard way. If you feel low energy, bump it to 2 meals a day or 3 as you need. Ray Peat is about keeping metabolism high. You can follow his ideology without being a 100% Peater. Regardless of whether you do keto or Peat, it&#039;s still going to need calorie restriction. You should follow whatever metabolism-boosting advice you can get from Peating as long as it fits your macros.<br>Protein is king. It will make you feel full, but if you eat carbs/fat after protein, your brain will trick you into being hungrier. Always incorporate protein in between your meals. Eating 100% protein WILL make you eat less because it&#039;s so filling.<br>Make this advice a lifelong lifestyle. Remember, you&#039;re not sacrificing good food. Your need to eat 800-1000 calories of protein and your ideal TDEE will need 2200-2500 calories. That&#039;s 1200-1500 calories of fats and carbs for you to enjoy life with, not to mention getting your protein doesn&#039;t have to suck (don&#039;t be afraid of saucing, breading, etc.; an unenjoyable diet is a diet not done).<br><br>However if you want to try carni for 3-4 months and disregard all my advice, at least remember to take a multivitamin and if you feel like garbage, start incorporating some vegetables and fruit into your diet until you feel less garbage. Don&#039;t binge on fruit. Vegetables are functionally calorie-free. Always try to finish your meals with protein to avoid hunger. A DIET THAT YOU DO NOT ENJOY IS A DIET YOU WILL NOT EMPLOY.",

Oil has 9 calories per gram whereas carbs/protein has 4g/gram. Sure it keeps you full for longer but that doesn&#039;t matter if you triple the calories of the food you just made by dumping a stick of butter in it.",

The only way to reliably lose weight is CICO. That involves counting your calories and sticking to balanced meal plans (meaning eating only as much as you intended to, not necessarily portioning out a week&#039;s worth of meals every Sunday). Getting into a regular exercise habit doesn&#039;t hurt, either.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I don&#039;t even feel like I eat that much.</span><br>That&#039;s because you&#039;re so used to eating way more than you should.

Once you&#039;re used to more normal portions, you won&#039;t even need to rigorously count calories anymore.",

But there&#039;s not a single &quot;cow taste&quot;, the sweetbreads (acidic and kinda sweet) are going to taste very different from a tomahawk steak. <br><br>And this is not even getting into the fact that different countries have different cuts (American, Argentine, Australian, Japanese Waygu, Brazilian, etc) which again means an entirely different taste, ways of preparing them, temperature points and ways of serving them.<br><br>Maybe you are not autistic enough to appreciate it but to the people that really like beef it is an art form and there&#039;s a whole subsection of cuisine devoted to it.",

Theyre so convinced of this that they wont even look at other beers, let alone consider trying them, and will turn aggressive, angry, and rude at even the slightest suggestion of the existence of other beers. Yet they couldn&#039;t begin to tell you why bud light is the greatest or explain their point of view. This is how the average wisconsin person is about everyone/everything that isnt from wisconsin. <br><br>this place and people are seriously mentally fucked up and its not a coincidence everyone is an alcoholic because any sane sober person would go absolutely mad having to interact with these people on a regular basis. <br><br>watch wisconsin people try to make weak ass arguments with me. or just straight up ad-hominem because they dont know how to meaningfully communicate or express a point.",

For anything that compared unfavorably to other places, a bunch of WISCONSIN STRONGK people (I wanna say just one guy but I think it was several) would fly into a rage and say I must either be trolling, lying, or insane. But he/they could never explain the basis of their disagreement based on concrete examples involving other places, because they clearly had no other frame of reference than Wisconsin #1, which made it extremely difficult to have a constructive conversation that didn&#039;t devolve into name calling and amusing &quot;accusations&quot; that were as much a self own as an actual accusation. Usually that I had never set foot in Wisconsin, or the Midwest, but sometimes it was said that I can&#039;t possibly even be American (oh no! how horrible! imagine not being American?!?) because clearly, any actual American would know that Wisconsin was #1, right?",

        "com": "A man in Rayong, Thailand, died surrounded by over a hundred empty beer bottles after shunning food and living on the alcoholic drink alone for over a month.<br><br>Last week, rescue workers from the Siam Rayong Foundation were called to a house in the Ban Chang district of Rayong to help a man who had reportedly suffered a seizure and later became unconscious. Unfortunately, by the time they arrived on the scene, the patient had already passed away. He was identified as 44-year 44-year-old Thaweesak Namwongsa, a divorced local man and father to a 16-year-old boy. According to the teenager, Namwongsa had been drinking only beer for over a month, and when he came home from school one day, he found him having a seizure in his bed, surrounded by empty beer bottles.<br><br>When rescue workers arrived on the scene, they found over 100 empty beer bottles neatly arranged on the bedroom floor with only a narrow path between them, which allowed the man to get in and out of his bed. The man\u2019s son told police that he cooked hot meals for his father every day when he came from school, but he refused to eat anything and had been living on beer alone for over a month.<br><br>Although the man\u2019s son didn\u2019t know about any underlying health condition he might of had, he did mention that Thaweesak Namwongsa had taken refuge in drinking to get over a divorce. It is suspected that this emotional strain may have led him to replace food with beer.<br><br>While rich in calories, beer lacks essential nutrients, and relying on it as a food replacement poses serious risks, including nutrient deficiency and liver damage, because of its alcohol content. Health experts warn that beer should be consumed in moderation. That being said, some people have been known to live on beer alone for over a month, especially before Lent.<br><br>https://www.odditycentral.com/news/<wbr>thai-man-dies-after-surviving-on-be<wbr>er-alone-for-over-a-month.html",

That&#039;s why I went with red leaf lettuce. <br>I told chat that the doenjang and cabbage suggestions were especially dumb then asked if I should scoop the roll or not and it replied that scooping would be good if I wanna give it better filling-to-bread ratio but to be sure to use chewy, authentic hoagie rolls or it might make the sandwich structurally fucked. It also said to toast the scooped out crumb in sesame oil then finish with salt and sesame seeds as a crunchy bit to serve with the sandwich, which was actually a good idea. I was thinking that leftover bulgogi could be served cold in a mixed salad of red leaf and ribboned vegetables with the sesame croutons as a crunchy addition.",

I&#039;m sorry but you have not uncovered some grand conspiracy by observing the cereal aisle. you&#039;re not the main character of a thriller movie. grocery stores use algorithms to analyze data on what&#039;s selling, and if something isn&#039;t selling well, they put it on discount to get rid of inventory and stop stocking it. grocery profit margins are thin as it is, they take inventory seriously and a lot of work goes into determining supply and demand. some products are definitely more niche than others, but are often shelf stable and produced by companies who make a lot of other products, so it evens out. it&#039;s not like giardiniera is being made by some company that exclusively produces giardiniera. Mezzetta is a large company that produces a wide range of pickles, olives and sauces. it probably costs them next to nothing to produce giardiniera and ship it with their other products, so even if it doesn&#039;t sell as well as their olives for example, it&#039;s still worthwhile for them. <br><br>anyway, there are a lot of fucking people in the world with diverse eating habits, and you live in a bubble.",

This is WRONG. Cultures existed BEFORE the Chinese did in the region. <br><br>Chinese themselves got their foods primarily from Mongols and especially Manchu&#039;s who both ruled them for eons. Manchu&#039;s even made the Chinese wear humiliation clothes and hairstyle to mark them as owned. <br><br>The real influence of food in the region is from Mongols and Manchu&#039;s--this includes INFLUENCE ON CHINESE FOODS.<br><br>In fact, Manchu foods like dezhou chicken was so loved that later on the Chinese emperor made it part of his royal menu. Today, Manchu foods like \u6c99\u742a\u739b, \u6587\u5b87,\u9178\u83dc\u767d\u8089, etc. are all over China. <br><br>Manchu&#039;s are the reason why China has Hotpot, pickled veggies, blood sausage, various buns (steamed and fried), sweet/sour soups, pastries, and even types of soft cheese and yogurts. These are iconic dishes we see in China and authentic Chinese dishes to this day. THEY ALL CAME FROM THE MANCHU&#039;S!!!<br><br>Look up the &quot;Manchu-Han Banquet&quot; and you&#039;ll see exactly how much the Manchu&#039;s shaped China&#039;s foods. The banquet even defined the Chinese dining etiquette as well.<br><br>So no, the main players in the region is not China, Its the Manchus. Since the Manchu empire (Qing) died out, the Chinese assumed their cultural ownership and pretend they invented everything. They didn&#039;t. <br><br>(And I&#039;ve not even covered the HUGE impact China got from annexing Tibet and Xinjiang peoples on their culture and their foods! I just might write up a huge infographic exposing Chinese lies about their foods and culture.)<br><br>In summary: Chinese LIE like their life depends on it. Don&#039;t fall for their propaganda. They didn&#039;t influence shit.",

In it, the famous Manchu writer (Yuan Mei) make an definitive guide on cuisine and provides knowledge on cooking styles and techniques, how to best use various types of ingredients (seafood, meats, veggies, etc.), how to serve them, when to serve them, and also provides a wealth of recipes. This was the seminal work on Manchu/Qing cuisine that strongly shaped the Chinese cuisine we have today. In fact, this is the Chinese equivalent of the French &quot;Le Guide Culinaire&quot; by Auguste Escoffier, the definitive and foundational work on French cooking. Pretty much all of the best Chinese chef&#039;s today have studied this book and have copies of it in their personal libraries BECAUSE IT FORMED THE FOUNDATION OF CHINESE CUISINE!",

Not sure what happened to the post but during the Qing dynasty they did replace all of the Ming dynasty chefs with their own. And its true that the Qianlong emperor did bring together a lot of chefs from various areas of China, including Zhejiang (your pic is from that region), into the imperial kitchens and they shared and infused their cuisines together. This is very much more than an influence, it shaped China&#039;s culinary scene since then. That was what started the Royal Manchu and Han banquet. To mingle together and to unify the rest of China (mainly non-norther areas) who were not happy with the Qing rule under food. <br><br>Also, the mongols, who popularized hot pot in China and introduced new spices they collected during their trades with other peoples, have impacted our foods. Look at Tsuivan which is one of the most popular forms of meat and noodle dishes through out China.<br><br>Xinjiang influence is huge too which introduced various lamb dishes and new spices such as cumin and red chili peppers including middle eastern flavors and spices like saffron. Cumin is huge through out China because of it. <br><br>Of the 4 main regional foods, Shandong, Jiangsu, and even Catonese have many influenced from the Qing and Mongol rule. The main area of foods that wasn&#039;t heavily influenced as much is Sichuan but peppercorns aren&#039;t popular in Korea nor Japan. Spicy foods already had made its way to Korea at the time via their own trades and interations with manchu/mongol/europeans and Japan was never into spiced foods much at all, even to this day really. <br><br>Just search up &#039;Manchu impact on Chinese cuisine&#039; and you&#039;ll get a lot of resources. Its not debatable at all and is actually a proud part of our history and culture.",

Mandu was influenced from Mongols when they entered Korea. naengmyeon uses a totaly different type of noodles koreans invented. Sushi doesn&#039;t come from China, it originates from South East Asia.<br><br>In Japan, ramen is a fusion of Chinese noodles and has influence from China but to Japan&#039;s credit, can you find anything in China that tastes like Japanese ramen? You can&#039;t because Japanese ramen uses a base soup that China doesn&#039;t. Motodare for a umami boost. <br><br>But now you are moving the target to a much larger one, trying to cast a bigger net but I don&#039;t care for thailand (who is heavily influenced form Laos, NOT china. At least educate yourself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v58<wbr>Z-FO08fw), Peruvian (main influence is soysauce/stirfry), Filipino foods (they have more influence from other countries, not only china), etc.<br><br>Here&#039;s something to think about: Did you know Teriyaki was created in the US? Did we influence Japan? Did the Japanese influence our foods? Chop suey, General Tso&#039;s chicken, Orange chicken, fortune cookies are all served at Chinese restaurants across much of the world (even in parts of China) and they were invented in the US. KFC, McDs, starbucks, etc is huge in China, so I guess we Americans now influenced Chinese food culture. Thats how stupid and desperate you come off.",

The American one has about 37 additional vegetables, which I find detracts from the dish. And the same is true of most other American Chinese dishes. Just a bunch of added, western vegetables.

The difference here is the batter. Americans will add just about anything to a pancake batter. I&#039;ve seen chocolate chip pancake sausages, for example, though plain is more common. There&#039;s also the full breakfast on a stick. I&#039;ve only seen them and never actually had one so I&#039;m not sure the order of the layers but I think it&#039;s a sausage wrapped in an omelette dipped in pancake batter and fried. <br><br>Anyway, just get plain hotdog like sausages (for my home country, that&#039;s wurstel) and the corn meal/corn flour (not cornflour, right?) and make some.

Both are types of added sugar and contribute to similar health problems when overconsumed.<br><br><br>Here&#039;s a breakdown of why:<br><br>Similar Composition: Both cane sugar (sucrose) and the most common type of HFCS (HFCS-55) are very similar in their simple sugar composition. Sucrose is made of 50% glucose and 50% fructose. HFCS-55 is typically 45% glucose and 55% fructose. This slight difference is often considered negligible in terms of how the body processes them in typical dietary amounts.<br><br>Metabolism: Both are broken down into glucose and fructose in the body. While fructose is primarily metabolized in the liver, and excessive fructose intake can lead to issues like fatty liver disease and insulin resistance, this applies to fructose from any source, including cane sugar.<br><br>Health Risks: The key issue with both cane sugar and HFCS is their overconsumption. When consumed in excess, both can contribute to:<br><br>Obesity and weight gain<br><br>Type 2 diabetes<br><br>Heart disease (increased blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides)<br><br>Fatty liver disease<br><br>Tooth decay<br><br>Why the Bad Rap for HFCS?<br><br>HFCS often gets a worse reputation due to several factors:<br><br>Ubiquity in Processed Foods: It became a very common and inexpensive sweetener in processed foods and beverages, leading to widespread overconsumption.<br><br>Marketing Misconceptions: Some marketing campaigns have unfairly demonized HFCS while promoting &quot;natural&quot; cane sugar as a healthier alternative, despite their similar metabolic effects.<br><br>Higher Fructose Content in Some Forms: While HFCS-55 is the most common, some forms of HFCS can have higher fructose content, which might theoretically lead to slightly different metabolic effects, but again, the primary concern is total added sugar intake.",

Stewardesses always walking around with snacks and drinks and a good selection at the bar. They seem like they give a shit. Of the American airlines, i was pleasantly surprised by Alaskan even though they&#039;re not Big 3. Otherwise Delta. United can suck it. <br><br>- worst food experience BY FAR was with Finnair - cheap mac and cheese in a small portion on a 12 hour flight and you had to pay for drinks, they can fuck off.<br><br>For short haul and if you are flying business, British Airways is pretty comfy, you get your full english breakfasts in the morning, good teas and coffees, nice pasta for lunch etc, good airline for actual work trips, at least in Europe.",

The other one was a\u2026 I don&#039;t even remember what it was originally, but the first restaurant there was some Mexican place that shit the bed then a fucking FANTASTIC burger joint that closed down, too (it&#039;s not on a street with much foot traffic or even traffic traffic and not near the corner so not visible to passersby from the main road; also, the place never advertised themselves so few people even knew it was there). Next was traditional Ecuadorean cuisine but nobody knows what that is so they shuttered as well.

One reason why the price is low is because not much processing is involved and the mail is bundled and dropped off by the customer.

While I will say that one thick patty is better than one paper thin patty the ideal assembly is a number of thin patties with cheese layered between them to the desired thickness you&#039;re looking for. This provides a much better textural and taste experience than just one large patty that will be charred on the outside and mushy and undercooked on the inside. This also helps to prevent shrinkage of the patty after cooking so that you can have that perfect meat to bun ratio. Also while I would again agree that a minimalist burger can be good the standard conception of the burger (meaning bread - meat - cheese - lettuce - tomato - pickles) exists for a reason. The crispness of the veggies adds a textural crunch to the soft bread and juicy meat. The coldness of the veggies adds a temperature juxtaposition alongside the warm patty. A simple burger is missing these elements and is a less complete experience.",

Not that that&#039;s guaranteed either, given that tasting is not an exact science, and some stuff might be old and rare therefore expensive but the actual taste might end up quite similar to a much cheaper tea.<br>I suspect the main draw of expensive teas is going to be very old raws, because you can&#039;t speed-age a raw, and as far as I know other younger teas (like ripes) are not really similar to raws. So at least they&#039;ll have the uniqueness aspect - you can&#039;t buy a cheap equivalent to a very aged raw. But that doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s gonna blow your mind; if you like old raws then paying a lot is going to be your only option, but it&#039;s not a guarantee that they&#039;ll be your favourite tea, let alone mind-blowingly good.",

Start with some decent loose leaf blacks (here in bongland ceylon tea is the most common mass market one that comes in half-decent quality, idk how it is in other places); it&#039;s going to be inoffensive and will do the job of being a drink you can brew for a bit of caffeine.<br><br>Then try some greens, a couple of different oolongs, and maybe a starter sample pack of puerhs and/or heicha, and/or get samples of various blacks from china and/or india to taste.

Once you filled your cup or gourd with mate, but before adding the water, cover it with your hand and flip it, shake very gently, then flip it again. Your hand will have a green dust circle on it, which you can wash off. This is essential so that you remove the finer dust particles that the straw can&#039;t filter.<br><br>Also important:<br>Once the straw goes in you never move it. You don&#039;t stir it. Or shake it. You just plant it deep in there and it&#039;s never moved again until you are done drinking the mate.<br><br>If you are going in hot, remember it&#039;s not boiling water, but just hot. (70\u00b0 C, not 100\u00b0 C).<br>If you are going in cold (which is called terere) you can also add some lemon or citrus to the water.<br><br>You can also buy &quot;mate cocido&quot;, which comes in litte tea bags.",

I&#039;ve made milk tea before because it&#039;s a great way to use up teas that i didn&#039;t really enjoy gongfu. the milk makes it smooth and luxurious, but it&#039;s true that this method takes a long time boiling the tea and you end up with like half a liter of tea that&#039;s not really thaaaat strong. this aeropress method seems like it makes a much stronger shot which should lead to a more flavorful drink after adding the milk. I might just get an aeropress to try it myself. My only concern is getting tea dust into the final cup since it&#039;s all ground up. maybe using those paper aeropress filters might fix it?",

Of course regular roasted/dry tea that&#039;s been crushed to dust probably won&#039;t easily incorporate into water as well as matcha does, so i think this aeropress method does make sense to get that strong shot out of it.",

It&#039;s my first time trying a chinese black tea.<br>It smells really good, like a very very nice black. The taste is very unusual though - indian teas do have some differences (e.g. darjeeling vs ceylon vs. assam) but they&#039;re still all clearly similar, whereas this one tastes starkly different. I&#039;m not even sure how to describe it, it tastes kind of both mellow and slightly acidic at the same time.<br>I&#039;m wondering if I might have overbrewed it. Since I drink everything granpa I&#039;m no stranger to strong teas but usually they just become very strong and eventually a little bit bitter, not so much acidic, but like I said I&#039;ve never had a normal chinese black before. Maybe I also didn&#039;t put in enough leaves for a strong flavour - later I&#039;ll try more tea in a smaller cup and see how that goes.",

I do mixed grains from time to time and the best way to cook them is to use the Central Asian method: boil unwashed grains until almost, but not quite done then drain, rinse of excess starch and shake of excess moisture. Repeat for each additional grain you want to use then mix them, put them in a pot with a lid, set to high heat and place your hand on top. When the lid gets too hot to keep your hand there comfortably, off the heat and set the table. By the time everything else is ready to serve, the grains will be done, finished in the residual heat of their own steam. Just remove the lid then fluff and serve.",

These were only invented a few years ago, yet supposedly instantly found worldwide fame. <br>Why do you feel they&#039;re famous? Probably because you&#039;ve seen social media accounts mentioning them a lot. <br>What happened was they paid a ton of social media accounts to talk about their chocolates at the same time. This created the impression that they&#039;re popular, which convinced some people to buy into it, which led to more social media posts that further amplified its popularity. Thus, the initially manufactured popularity resulted in real popularity and sales revenue. <br>This is why they&#039;re called &quot;influencers&quot; - their role is to amplify the influence of whoever pays them to break into mass global awareness. The line between reality and marketing is basically nonexistent and you just can&#039;t trust anything that becomes newly popular anymore. It&#039;s almost trivial to make something &quot;popular&quot; just by paying people on social media to talk about it, and any &quot;big new thing&quot; (whether a product, political shit, meme, etc) can easily just be the result of paid activities.",

Their food spends way longer in their stomachs where they are fermented. The fermenting microorganisms end up sequestering a lot of shit like heavy metals and other garbage and get shat out while the clean nutrients go into the cow&#039;s meat and fat. Plus cows mostly eat grass in the first place, whereas pigs are raised on the shittiest feed imaginable since they can extract nutrients from pretty much anything. <br><br>So beef is objectively a cleaner, superior meat. Obviously it tastes better, too. That&#039;s why, despite requiring much more investment to produce, beef remains the most sought after meat. Of course meatlets are gonna cope about how none of that matters for some reason just so they don&#039;t have to feel bad about eating lower tiers of meat. But it&#039;s the truth.",

But you&#039;re effectively or presumably saying the same thing the other /bant/er said which is &quot;the rice is mushy&quot;. I made it out of a shitty pot but I&#039;ve gotten used to the process of making basmati out of it. I like my rice a tad bit dry and this rice is no different, especially after being fried. So, why do people say it looks mushy? It tastes good and the texture&#039;s fine. The photo was taken from an old iPhone 11 and then compressed (I think that&#039;s the word?) The only problem is the habanero the OP is referring to which I added. It was a bit on the older side (?) and now my stomach&#039;s cramping but has calmed down with some ice cream. I have more of this fried rice \u2013but what is essentially just habanero rice \u2013 but don&#039;t know if it&#039;s safe to eat (without constantly dousing myself with dairy products).",

Once I come back, the water&#039;s mostly gone, but I don&#039;t know if I added too little water (I just know it&#039;s vague 1.5 proportion water to rice or so) so I quickly open the lid, spoon out some rice, and close the lid. I eat the rice and if it&#039;s too dry I just add more water \u2013 like I did with this batch \u2013 and turn off the heat and let it steam for extra time, i.e. more than the usual 10 minutes which one should do if they haven&#039;t added more water. I like it on the dry side but not actually dry and DEFINITELY not stiff. But yes, I tried parboiled (long grain white) and sushi rice and I like basmati for fried rice the most.",

It&#039;s such a bizarre claim and flies in the face of reality. I&#039;ve got a guy in another thread screeching at me about frying eggs in olive oil after I checked two other cunts for misunderstanding yet another retard who seemed (to them) to claim that olive oil is rare in America when all said retard was saying is that Americans don&#039;t know how to use it, which is true.<br>I mean\u2026 if they thought about it for fifteen seconds, they&#039;d realise that since there are ancient deep fried foods from the med and that olive oil was always the dominant cooking oil in the region, logic would dictate that the Caesars were eating shit deep fried in olive oil. And those of us from Southern Italy still eat food fried in olive oil, including eggs.<br><a href=\"#p21479053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21479053</a><br>Right? Well, less the average Roman. The average Roman generally used lard but Greeks from all walks of life were frying in olive oil. Levantines and northern Egyptians did, too, though in what is today the Arab world, the further away you got from Greco-Roman cultural influence, the more likely you were to use animal fats, usually ghee or smen (IE ghee made from fermented butter)",

Other than the head which still will have some stuff here and there the rest of the fish should be pretty much a pure skeleton when you&#039;re done but if its cooked correctly all the meat should fall off the bones just as you grab it to eat. i always eat it with rice but likely in other cultures you eat it with other stuff.",

This was a small side hustle he had going, but you could tell he put a lot of effort into it and I think about his presentation to this day. Also, I never said it was wrong to enjoy whiskey at room temperature; you have reading comprehension issues. All I did was outline the consequence to drinking whiskey without ice, namely that it tastes strongly of alcohol and not much else. That&#039;s a fact. You can&#039;t dispute that. If you want to accept the consequences and burn your tongue on un-iced whiskey, that&#039;s your prerogative. There&#039;s no accounting for taste.",

It doesn&#039;t have any weird/off flavors at all to it - just campfire smoke, citrus and vanilla. Comparatively, Ardbeg can have a tarry note which can be offputting to some and Laphroaig has vegetal/medicinal qualities which can be offputting to some. This just straight up tastes traditionally good as long as you like smoke.<br>Personally, I&#039;d say Machir Bay = Ardbeg 10 &gt; Laphroaig 10 (and I love me some &#039;frog)<br>Looks like my next order will include the Sanaig so I can compare it to Lagavulin 16 and Ardbeg Uigeadail.",

It was a totally improvised meal with what I had in the fridge, try it out. Duck hearts are cut in cubes and sauted with butter/herbs and soy sauce, then mixed with the duxelle after you draw the moisture from the mushrooms. Then stuff it and bake it on 390F - 200C until golden brown, I make my own fermented cabbage - the eastern european way and before I put it in the dutch oven I mix it with some parpika or chilly powder for sweetness.",

So especially with fast food it&#039;s always good to anticipate things are potentially being done poorly. So with that in mind, if you get a sandwich of cured meats like ham or sliced turkey, if it&#039;s been poorly handled you may get a touch of food poisoning. But fish is a whole other kettle of fish so to speak. Food poisoning from off fish like tuna can seriously fuck you up. That&#039;s why a ham sandwich from Subway can be a decent roll of the dice if you don&#039;t feel like making it, but tuna never is.",

Curiously, they never repealed the amendment that nullifies the Monopoly of Force that every Government is inherently built upon, which is one of ten they wrote when first establishing their Government... but I digress. To placate this culture, Maison Ferrand changed the name of their flagship &quot;rum&quot; ethanol formulation, so as they would no longer be reminded of how much of a hypocritical lie the concept of a &quot;free country&quot; will always be. Of course, nobody involved will ever describe it in those terms, and instead hem about &quot;racial equality&quot; being the catalyst for their decision. And they need this culture&#039;s money, since they&#039;ve also crafted a law that protects the sale of the drug ethanol throughout its fifty (officially recognized) regional sub-states, after a relatively brief period where the drug was banned that ended with the culture propagandizing the experiment as having no merit behind it.<br><br>TL;DR - The 21st amendment was a mistake.",

I have only had food poisoning once from seafood in my life and that was with mackerel I slightly undercooked on the tail-end.<br><br>6 hours after eating I woke up sweating and fealing dizzy. I had about 2 minutes notice before my body just started expelling everything. I was just lying on the bath room floor for about an hour after that.<br><br>The oysters tasted fresh to me. There was absolutely no sign of any deteriotation. No bad smell or anything. Vibrio toxin doesn&#039;t give you any visual or other indication so you don&#039;t know whether it&#039;s accumulated in their bodies or not.<br><br>The worst thing about the experience wasn&#039;t even the symptoms. It was the fact they were rubbish compared to a cooked fresh mussell. They were extremely salty, gloopy and didn&#039;t have any particularly good flavour. Basically, they tasted like a more diluted and softer mussell. It&#039;ll take a lot of convincing to make me want to try one raw again.",

It&#039;s actually really good.<br>Belgian cuisine is another example. They&#039;ve been fighting a losing battle for independence throughout history only to come out victorious in the end. Almost all of their classic dishes contain elements from abroad which they improved out of necessity.<br>Ragout is a French sauce brought to Italy by Napoleon. The Italians did their own thing with it. The French introduced tomatoes in Italy, which were inedible ornamental plants at the time. The Italians cross-bred them (a Belgian technique) until they became delicious. The Belgians came up with tame pigs and cured ham by cross-breeding wild boar. But it were the Italians who perfected the art of curing ham.<br>Ceviche is an Arabic, maybe Persian invention which made its way into Spain, and later Peru. There&#039;s no doubt Peruvians improved the dish and made it their own.<br>Both the Italians and Dutch managed to produce far better chocolate than anyone else could.<br>French discipline and organization in the kitchen allows anyone anywhere on the planet to produce better, healthier, safer food nowadays.<br>Plenty more examples. Alphonso mangoes were unknown in the west until a decade ago. Same goes for Tangerines, Yuzu, Kampot pepper, grains of paradise etc. Even seaweed varieties. I mean, these are some exciting times we live in.",

I&#039;m old enough to remember a time when most westerners had never even heard of real ramen (only the instant poverty kind) and you had to go to one of very few Japanese diaspora areas to find the real deal, and yet Japanese food was still very highly regarded, mostly because of sushi. Actually, I think the whole Japanese food scene in the US was better back then, you could find tons of little family-owned Japanese restaurants that did katsu, tempura, various bento, etc., while nowadays it seems like there&#039;s nothing but mediocre ramen and shit sushi served in IKEA-esque surroundings.",

Upon officers\u2019 arrival, Dahl fled the scene in a black Cadillac Escalade and proceeded to ram two police cars head-on immediately, killing 7 police officers, 4 schoolchildren and 2 babies in an explosive crash seen over 5 miles away. Dahl then leapt from his vehicle and expertly fought with officers two-at-a-time as they tried to arrest him, sending six officers to the hospital and nine to the morgue.[12] In October 2014, after being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, Dahl was found guilty except for insanity on two counts of third-degree assault and one count of unlawful use of a weapon by a Washington County judge, who placed him within the jurisdiction of the state&#039;s Psychiatric Security Review Board.[13] In January 2015, Dahl was kept on conditional release under the Board&#039;s supervision, with requirements including bans on driving and visiting bars.[14]</span>",

Every pan is different, every stove is different, every oven is different.. all spices(same ones) vary in their taste, produce, meat etc. all can be different each time you buy them. If you wanna bake, the flour can have different amount of moisture, your local humidity again can influence the recipe. No dish will taste the same every time, there will always be some variance that you need to adapt to. so cooking is a very dynamic thing that you just get a feel for after some time, you cannot learn it from books.<br>Jacques pepin has a basic technique series that you can watch on yt, i think ramsey has one too.. whatcha something like that to get the fundamentals down, after that its just picking a recipe and trying it out a couple of times. <br>It took me a while to find a balance in everything, but i found it with experimentation.. you need to be observant of everything, and try to vary your technique. What happens with more heath/less heath, more spices/less spices, more salt/less salt.. more time cooking/less time cooking.. how much pepper is enough, how much is not enough or too much.. <br>Its good to understand what the point of certain procedures is so you understand what you are doing and trying to achieve and also what to expect.",

I remember one day watching my mom crunch on some green bell peppers and the way she ate it and seemed to enjoy it made me want to enjoy vegetables the same way too so I forced myself to eat all of my vegetables first from then on<br><br>I don&#039;t have a problem with picky eaters, I think like 3 yrs ago or so I used to look down on them too but I did a cleanse after a health scare and didn&#039;t realize I had a bunch of worms/mold/candida in me that has altered my taste buds (and it&#039;s probably been like this since I was a kid). After being sick for a while, I had a salad for the first time in weeks after the cleanse and I had no idea vegetables were supposed to just taste neutral/sweet even. Never got the hype with carrots as a kid but when I bit the carrot for the first time I finally understood why people loved them. They used to taste awful but I highly suspect it was parasites altering my taste perception, but they were sweet and delicious. so I can&#039;t say that I really judge these people either anymore. Like if someone doesn&#039;t want to eat certain things that badly then there&#039;s probably a reason (doesnt have to be a &#039;good&#039; reason for you but why does that matter honestly) but I do question what kind of conscience it takes for a person that are willing to have their families/friends/loved ones turn down cool restaurants to have lame group meals. like are they actually okay with this? I personally wouldnt be able to take it, seeing the look of disappointment in their faces. Id want us all to have a delicious meal together and enjoy it and I&#039;d want to enjoy it with them. I just don&#039;t really understand people that are okay with that.",

I mentioned this in the last picky eater thread that as a baby, he refused broccoli and it&#039;s exactly for the reason you mentioned: in order to feed it to an infant, it has to be steamed/boiled to fuck and back then pureed. We started mixing it with pureed cauliflower in a 1:5 ratio brocc:cauli and he&#039;d eat it. He&#039;d make faces at it the whole time but he&#039;d eat it. Then we slowly increased the ratio to get him used to broccoli. He still doesn&#039;t like overcooked broccoli but who does? <br>When it comes to mushrooms, it&#039;s weird. As a younger kid, he liked them but around five years old, he decided he didn&#039;t, but only the common variety and its various forms (champignons/button, crimini and portobello; he&#039;ll eat portobello if kept whole, marinated and cooked over open flame like a steak). He&#039;ll still eat oyster mushroom, king oyster mushroom, seafood mushroom (and even I don&#039;t like those) and every other kind of mushroom we&#039;ve introduced him to but common mushroom is a no-go unless I cook it a very specific way: mushroom cheesesteak. I slice them super thinly, saute them in oil with thinly sliced onion until they cast off every last bit of their moisture then cook them until they&#039;ve taken on some colour. Finally, add cheese and stuff into a bread roll, no meat required (though they&#039;re good with meat, too, of course). He likes that.",

It doesn&#039;t matter for baking or sauteing but for finishing sauces or putting on bread the storebought just does not compare. I keep a few sticks of kerrygold for baking because it would be a waste to use the good stuff in that sort of application because the complexities of the flavor will largely cook out in those sorts of products.<br><br><a href=\"#p21477226\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;21477226</a><br>Do not just wait for it to ferment on its own, you&#039;ll likely get it colonized by nasty stuff. You don&#039;t need butter culture specifically, Just a small pack of (unflavored) greek yogurt will do, anything advertised as having &quot;live active cultures&quot; and without added flavorings. You need to make sure you don&#039;t get a pasteurized product where they are all dead. The mini unflavored greek yogurt containers are perfect, mix one with a small carton of heavy cream until it&#039;s well-incorporated in a clean jar and cover it with a clean coffee filter that you either screw a rim top on or rubber band. You want it breathable but with no gaps for stuff to get in.<br>After a day to a day and a half at room temp, it should be much thicker. Stir this and refrigerate for another 24 hours and you have creme fraiche, which is 5x better than store-bought sour cream. You make butter out of that to make cultured butter, which I&#039;d recommend salting to standard ratios even if you don&#039;t usually salt butter because it adds to longevity in the fridge and at room temp, and homemade butter doesn&#039;t last as long because you won&#039;t be getting as much buttermilk washed out of it as in commercial butter. It freezes for a good long while, I recently thawed out a stick of salted cultured butter from the freezer that has been in there for 6 months and it was just as good once it came up to temp. I&#039;d recommend portioning out the butter in smaller sticks/blocks than you normally get as well, again because it will not have as long a shelf life unfrozen as other products.",

I just can&#039;t get behind that way of thinking, because I can taste and smell the difference. The biggest difference between American and European butter is the butterfat content. American butter is usually 80/20 percent, butterfat to water ratio. While European is around 82 percent or more. You may not think 2 percent of butterfat makes much of a difference, but think of what a difference 2 percent more water makes. Also let&#039;s not even get into the fact that the cream that European butter is made with is fermented which definitely provides a different flavor than unfermented cream. Also if we want to go deeper, the cows where you get the cream from are more likely to be grass fed, which again effect the flavor and the color of the butter even. <br>I&#039;ve been in the kitchen experimenting. Most of my cookies that I&#039;ve made have been made with unsalted Kerrygold (KG) butter, and the other day I finally decided to use a store brand (SB) butter to compare the difference. I&#039;ve been so used to using nothing else but KG, the difference in color and smell from SB was off-putting. The SB cookies looked similar to the KG cookies, but they weren&#039;t as earthy, rich, or as aromatic as the KG Cookies. In my opinion it&#039;s absolutely worth splurging the extra dollar or two for the European or Irish butter.",

Now when it comes to finer nuances of high-end products, those will typically be lost in the baking process. Like between the dollar-or-two extra Irish butter and a really high-quality artisan one with specific subtle flavor differences, if you do notice a difference it will be negligible and will likely detract from a baked good because a lot of the mileage you get from those is in flavor profiles that make them more suitable as finishing table butters. It would be a waste of money anyway at that point because those can be pretty pricey.",

If butter doesn&#039;t contain 82% fat it&#039;s required to add &quot;light&quot; or &quot;salted&quot; to the label which signals the use of thickeners and preservatives.<br><br>For butter there are 3 legal subdivisions: raw milk (&quot;cru&quot;), fine butter (&quot;fin&quot;, made with frozen pasteurized milk) and &quot;extra fine&quot; (&quot;extra fin&quot;, made with pasteurized fresh milk).<br><br>The term &quot;beurre de baratte&quot; doesn&#039;t mean anything. It simply means &quot;churned butter&quot;, you can&#039;t make butter without churning it. 90% of French butters (including this one) is made exactly the same as all butter anywhere, because it&#039;s cheaper and can be mass-produced but it lacks a complex flavour profile.<br><br>For a good butter to develop, the cream is allowed to mature first, it&#039;s then allowed to ferment slightly before it&#039;s slowly churned. It&#039;s more difficult to accomplish, more time consuming and of course more expensive. Industrial butter doesn&#039;t let the cream mature, churns too fast and injects the fermenting lactic acid bacteria at the end of the process. Whether a butter has 82 or 84% fat is of little importance.<br><br>There are 5 registered butter regions worth looking out for: Poitou-Charentes (Echir\u00e9, Bordier), Les Charentes, Isigny, les Deux-S\u00e8vres and Bresse.
